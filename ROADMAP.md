# Combinatorial Rigidity — Roadmap

This directory aims to formalize a slice of **combinatorial rigidity theory**
in mathlib style, culminating in **Laman's theorem** (1970): a graph on
`n ≥ 2` vertices is generically rigid in the plane iff it contains a
spanning subgraph with `2n − 3` edges in which every subgraph on `k ≥ 2`
vertices has at most `2k − 3` edges. Such graphs are called *Laman graphs*
or *minimally rigid* graphs in the plane.

The work is expected to span multiple sessions. This file is the canonical
hand-off document: it carries the directory layout, status, mathematical
plan, and engineering conventions. Read it after `CLAUDE.md`.

> **Agents:** start with `CLAUDE.md` (the agent operating manual covering
> reading order, per-session workflow, friction review, and the
> `notes/PhaseN.md` template). This file is the *what*; CLAUDE.md is the
> *how*.
>
> Design rationale (why these choices and not others) lives in
> `DESIGN.md`. Open it only when you actually need to question a
> decision; otherwise this file is sufficient.

Phase-level details (per-phase lemma checklists, decisions made during
that phase, hand-off notes) live under `notes/PhaseN.md`. Read those
when picking up a phase or reviewing how an earlier phase was finished.

**Cleanup rounds** between phases get their own work log under
`notes/PhaseN-cleanup.md` (named to sort next to the prior phase's
notes) and a row in this table for visibility. Round-level discipline
lives in `CLEANUP.md` at the repo root.

Add lemmas in the file that introduces the relevant definition; a
lemma about `IsSparse` belongs in `Sparsity.lean`, not in `Laman.lean`,
even if it is first used there. When starting a new phase, create the
corresponding `notes/PhaseN.md` file in your first commit.

## Mathematical roadmap

We follow the **Henneberg construction** route, which is elementary and
matches mathlib's combinatorics style. The matroid-theoretic route via
`Mathlib.Combinatorics.Matroid` is left as a future alternative framing.

### Phase 1 — Sparsity (`EdgesIn.lean`, `Sparsity.lean`, `Laman.lean`)

Complete. Defines `edgesIn`, `IsSparse`, `IsTight`, `IsLaman` and the
basic API (monotonicity, subgraph preservation, global edge bound,
vertex partition). See `notes/Phase1.md` for the full lemma list and
phase-specific decisions.

### Phase 2 — Laman graphs (`Laman.lean`)

Complete. Builds the Laman API on top of the Phase 1 `IsLaman`
definition: the `(2, 3)`-tightness `iff` unfolding, the K₂ base case
(promoted to a named theorem), and the degree results that feed into
the Henneberg induction (minimum degree ≥ 2 for `n ≥ 3`; existence of
a degree-2-or-3 vertex). See `notes/Phase2.md` for the full lemma list
and phase-specific decisions.

### Phase 3 — Henneberg moves (`Henneberg.lean`)

Complete. Type I and Type II moves on simple graphs (fresh vertex as
`none : Option V`, old vertices via `some`). Both moves preserve the
Laman property (`typeI_isLaman`, `typeII_isLaman`); both edge-set
decompositions land (`typeI_edgeSet[_ncard]`, `typeII_edgeSet[_ncard]`).
Iso transport (`IsSparse.iso`, `IsTight.iso`, `IsLaman.iso`, plus
`Iso.image_edgesIn`) lifts Laman across graph isomorphisms. The
`K₄ \ e` worked example (`top_fin_four_minus_edge_isLaman`) ties
these together. The canonical iso constructors
`typeI_iso_of_two_neighbors` and `typeII_iso_of_three_neighbors`
package the iso `G ≃g typeI G' a b` (resp. `…typeII…`) from
neighborhood data at a chosen vertex; downstream phases consume these
to bridge flat-form reverse decompositions with operation-form forward
preservation theorems.

The structural decomposition theorem
(`IsLaman.exists_typeI_or_typeII_reverse`, now in flat form per Phase 7
Commit 6) lives in `Henneberg.lean`. Phase 3 originally shipped only
the iso-only half (no `G'.IsLaman` claim) because the typeII reverse
can fail for an arbitrary non-adjacent pair (concrete 6-vertex
counter-example in `notes/Phase3.md`); the strengthened claim with
`G'.IsLaman` was deferred to Phase 5 — see §5 below — and re-presented
in flat form in Phase 7.

See `notes/Phase3.md` for the full lemma list and phase-specific
decisions.

Both moves additionally preserve generic rigidity (TODO in Phase 5,
because the proof needs the typeII reverse blocker argument).

### Phase 4 — Frameworks and infinitesimal rigidity (`Framework.lean`)

Complete. Defines `Framework V d` as `V → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`,
the `RigidityMap G p` as an `ℝ`-linear map (the matrix view via
`LinearMap.toMatrix` is deferred until needed), `IsInfinitesimallyRigid
G p` as the kernel-dimension bound `dim ker ≤ d(d+1)/2`, and
`IsGenericallyRigid G d` as existence of an infinitesimally rigid
placement. Ships the basic `RigidityMap` API (`Framework.finrank`,
`rigidityMap_apply`, `rigidityMap_ker_mono`,
`rigidityMap_finrank_range_le`), the graph-monotonicity corollaries
(`IsInfinitesimallyRigid.mono`, `IsGenericallyRigid.mono`), the main
edge-count theorem `IsGenericallyRigid.card_mul_le` (`d * #V ≤ #E +
d(d+1)/2` for any generically rigid graph), and the K₂ worked example
`top_fin_two_isGenericallyRigid`. The `TrivialMotions` API (textbook
identification of kernel with rigid motions) and the
`finrank_trivialMotions_eq_of_affinelySpanning` lemma were deferred
in Phase 4 (neither was on the critical path for Phase 5) and landed
in Phase 6's `TrivialMotions.lean`. See `notes/Phase4.md` for the full
lemma list and phase-specific decisions.

### Phase 5 — Laman's theorem, (⇐) direction (`LamanTheorem.lean`, `HennebergRigidity.lean`)

Complete. The main iff statement lives in `LamanTheorem.lean`:
```
theorem SimpleGraph.isGenericallyRigid_two_iff_exists_isLaman_le
    {V : Type*} [Fintype V] (G : SimpleGraph V) (h : 2 ≤ Fintype.card V) :
    G.IsGenericallyRigid 2 ↔
      ∃ H : SimpleGraph V, H ≤ G ∧ H.IsLaman
```
*composed* from two named directional theorems —
`IsLaman.isGenericallyRigid_two` for (⇐), proved in Phase 5, and
`IsGenericallyRigid.exists_isLaman_le` for (⇒), `sorry`-blocked and
resolved in **Phase 6** (see §6 below).

**(⇐) recap.** Henneberg induction on `Fintype.card V`. K₂ base case
via `top_fin_two_isGenericallyRigidInj 1` + iso transport. Inductive
step via `IsLaman.exists_typeI_or_typeII_reverse` (strengthened
decomposition with `G'.IsLaman`, proved via the Henneberg blocker
argument) plus per-move rigidity preservation
(`typeI_isGenericallyRigidInj_two` /
`typeII_isGenericallyRigidInj_two`, both unconditional). The Type II
move's collinearity gap is discharged by `IsInfinitesimallyRigid.
eventually` (openness of IR via `LinearIndependent.eventually`) plus
a perpendicular perturbation packaged in
`exists_nonCollinear_rigid_placement_dim_two`. See `notes/Phase5.md`
for the full lemma list and proof techniques.

**Open refactor proposal** (not a blocker): the three contradiction
templates in the milestone-1 blocker argument
(`IsLaman.contradiction_{one,two,three}_pair`) plus the degree-3
dispatcher can be unified through two reusable `(k, ℓ)`-shaped
primitives, saving ~210 LoC. Full plan in `notes/Phase5.md`'s
appendix.

### Phase 6 — Laman's theorem, (⇒) direction (`LamanTheorem.lean`, `RigidityMatroid.lean`)

Complete. Builds the rigidity-matroid scaffolding in `RigidityMatroid.lean`
(row-independence, dual-module bridge, rank lower bound at generic
placement, rank upper bound at affinely-spanning placement, basis-pick),
then ships Lovász–Yemini's easy direction in dim 2:
`isSparse_of_edgeSetRowIndependent_dim_two` (row-independent edge sets
yield `(2, 3)`-sparse spanning subgraphs) and the assembly
`IsGenericallyRigid.exists_isLaman_le` (combine the affinely-spanning
rigid placement, basis-pick, and sparsity). The iff
`isGenericallyRigid_two_iff_exists_isLaman_le` in `LamanTheorem.lean`
now closes both directions. Phase 4 deliberately kept `Framework.lean`
matroid-agnostic (see DESIGN.md *Notion- and matroid-agnostic core*);
Phase 6 stood up `RigidityMatroid.lean` on top without packaging the
abstract `Matroid` instance, since the easy direction needs only the
row-independence relation and two linear-algebra facts.

The chapter ran in **forward blueprint mode** per `blueprint/DESIGN.md`
*Recommendation for Phase 6*: the blueprint chapter
`blueprint/src/chapter/laman-theorem.tex` (its $\Rightarrow$ subsection)
served as the authoritative dep-graph and lemma index throughout. See
`notes/Phase6.md` for the full lemma list and phase-specific decisions.

### Phase 7 — Lovász–Yemini matroid identification (`CountMatroid.lean`, `MatroidIdentification.lean`)

Complete. Phase 6 shipped the easy direction of Lovász–Yemini in dim 2
(row-independent $\Rightarrow$ $(2, 3)$-sparse). Phase 7 shipped the
converse, the general $(k, \ell)$-count matroid in the matroidal regime
$\ell < 2k$ (Whiteley 1996, Lee--Streinu 2008), and the planar
rigidity-matroid specialisation. Hard-direction induction lives in
`MatroidIdentification.lean` and routes through the matroidal-regime
$I$-component scaffolding in `Sparsity.lean` (`IsSparse.maxBlock` and
edge-disjointness); the abstract `(k, \ell)`-count matroid sits in its
own file `CountMatroid.lean` via `IndepMatroid.ofFinite`. The phase ran
in **forward blueprint mode** with `blueprint/src/chapter/count-matroid.tex`
and `blueprint/src/chapter/rigidity-matroid.tex` as the authoritative
dep-graphs and lemma indices. See `notes/Phase7.md` for the full lemma
list and phase-specific decisions.

The **linear-matroid framing** of the rigidity matroid (the
generic-placement matroid $M_p$ on $E(K_V)$ via `Matroid.ofFun` for
some generic $p$, with Lovász--Yemini stated as a matroid iso
$M_{p_{\text{gen}}} \cong \mathrm{rigidityMatroid}\,V$) is deferred to
**Phase 8**, which will add `apnelson1/Matroid` as a dependency.

### Phase 8 — Linear-matroid framing (`LinearRigidityMatroid.lean`)

Complete. Packages the planar rigidity matroid in its linear-algebra
form via `Matroid.ofFun` (from the `apnelson1/Matroid` library) of
the rigidity-row function at a uniformly-generic placement, and
identifies it with the combinatorial $(2, 3)$-count matroid of
Phase 7 (Lovász--Yemini, linear-matroid form). The target
`linearRigidityMatroid_eq_rigidityMatroid` is package equality on
`Matroid (Sym2 V)`, since both matroids share ground set
$E(K_V)$; the content is uniform genericity
(`exists_uniform_rowIndependent_placement_dim_two`), proved by
linear-interpolation perturbation on the finite family of
$(2, 3)$-sparse subsets routed through two new mirror lemmas under
`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean` (rectangular Gram-det
characterization of LI; cofiniteness of LI along an affine line via
a one-variable real polynomial Gram determinant). The chapter ran in **forward
blueprint mode** with `blueprint/src/chapter/rigidity-matroid.tex`'s
*Linear-matroid framing* subsection as the authoritative dep-graph.
See `notes/Phase8.md` for the full lemma list, decisions, and
hand-off.

### Phase 9 — Pebble game (`PebbleGame/{Basic, Algorithm, Correctness}.lean`)

Complete. Formalizes the basic $(k, \ell)$-pebble game of
Lee--Streinu 2008 (generalising the original $(2, 3)$ algorithm of
Jacobs--Hendrickson 1997) end-to-end in the matroidal regime
$\ell < 2k$ matching Phase 7. The pebble game lives in a
`PebbleGame/` subdirectory split three ways post-Phase-9-perf
(see `notes/PERFORMANCE.md` *Split candidates ranked by leverage*
item 5 for the file-size-driven split rationale):
`PebbleGame/Basic.lean` carries state + invariants;
`PebbleGame/Algorithm.lean` the three-layer algorithm chain;
`PebbleGame/Correctness.lean` the correctness theorems and the
matroidal-independence corollary. The chapter ships the
`PartialOrientation V` state (bundled `Finset (V × V)` with
`no_loops` + `no_antiparallel`), the path-reversal and arc-insertion
moves with per-vertex and subset-level accounting lemmas, the
`Reachable k ℓ` inductive predicate packaging the algorithmic
state space, the four pebble-game invariants of L-S Lemma 10
(`Reachable.{out_le, peb_add_out_eq, pebOn_add_span_add_outOn,
pebOn_add_outOn_ge, span_add_le}`), and the three-layer algorithm
chain `tryReachPebbleWith → tryAddEdgeWith → runPebbleGameWith`
(each as a fully-computable workhorse with a thin noncomputable
math-layer wrapper specialising to `D.outList` / `G.edgeFinset`
enumeration). The certificate-form correctness theorem
`runPebbleGame_correct` (`G.IsSparse k ℓ ↔ ∃ D, runPebbleGame G k ℓ
= some D`) combines soundness `runPebbleGame_sound` (via the
`span_eq_ncard_edgesIn` bridge identity under
`runPebbleGame_underline_eq_edgeFinset`) with completeness
`runPebbleGame_eq_none_imp_exists_witness` (per-edge failure-witness
extraction routed through Lemma 13 algebraic core
`Reachable.independent_brings_pebble` and its SimpleGraph-form
wrapper). The matroidal-independence corollary
`SimpleGraph.countMatroid_indep_iff_runPebbleGame` follows as a
three-`rw` composition with Phase 7's `countMatroid_indep_iff`. A
pre-phase **DFS warmup** under `Search/DFS.lean` (modelled on
`Batteries.UnionFind`'s `termination_by` pattern) exercised the
verified-iterative-graph-search idiom in isolation; it ships the
`DirectedWalk` inductive, the `reachableFinding` primitive with
correctness theorem (soundness + completeness via
`DirectedWalk.dropUntilBundle` truncation), and the abstract
`reachClosure` over `Relation.ReflTransGen`. The chapter ran in
**forward blueprint mode** with
`blueprint/src/chapter/pebble-game.tex` as the authoritative
dep-graph. See `notes/Phase9.md` for the full lemma list,
decisions, and hand-off; the *component pebble game* (L-S §5,
$O(n^2)$ speedup via union pair-find) and the Henneberg-sequence
application (L-S §6) are deferred to potential follow-up phases.

### Phase 10 — Executable pebble game (`PebbleGame/{Exec, Examples}.lean`, `Main.lean`)

Complete. Bridges Phase 9's `noncomputable` `runPebbleGame` to an
actually-runnable decision procedure: the computable wrapper
`runPebbleGameExec` plugs `Finset.sort`-based list views (via
`outListSorted` for out-neighbour lists and `edgeListSorted` for
edges via the `Lex (V × V)` projection of `Sym2`) under
`[LinearOrder V]` into Phase 9's `-With` workhorses, lifts the
certificate-form correctness theorem to a workhorse-level
restatement that both the math-layer `runPebbleGame` and the new
`runPebbleGameExec` derive from as one-line corollaries, registers
the canonical `Decidable` instances for `IsSparse k ℓ` / `IsTight`
/ `IsLaman` (in the matroidal regime $\ell < 2k$, with a top-level
`Fact (3 < 2 * 2)` making the Laman case zero-hypothesis), and
ships a `lake exe pebble-game` CLI binary that reads an edge-list
file and prints `LAMAN` / `SPARSE_NOT_TIGHT` / `NOT_SPARSE`. Both
`#eval (decide G.IsLaman)` and the CLI reduce through the same
compiled `runPebbleGameExec` body. Chapter ran in **forward
blueprint mode** with `blueprint/src/chapter/executable.tex` as
the authoritative dep-graph. See `notes/Phase10.md` for the full
layer-by-layer summary and the architectural-choice list. The
blocking-witness extraction at the CLI's failure branch (which
also blocks an analogous orientation-witness extraction on the
success branch) was deferred during Layer 5 and is the focus of
**Phase 11** below.

### Phase 11 — Witness extraction (`Search/DFS.lean`, `PebbleGame/{Basic,Algorithm,Correctness,Exec}.lean`, `Main.lean`)

Complete. **Structural-edit phase** that maximally reshaped Phase
9/10's $\mathrm{Option}$-shaped pebble-game algorithms into the
verdict-bearing inductive `PebbleGameResult G k ℓ`, whose `.accept`
constructor carries the partial orientation $D$ and whose `.reject`
constructor carries the blocking subset $V'$. The workhorse-level
`tryAddEdgeWith` / `runPebbleGameWith` mirror-reshaped to
`Sum (WorkhorseWitness k ℓ V) (PartialOrientation V)`, with the
`independent_brings_pebble`-driven failure witness constructed
inline at case5 of `tryAddEdgeWith`'s recursion; Phase 9's
existence chain (`_isSome` / `_eq_none_imp_exists_witness`) is
absorbed and the certificate-form correctness theorems collapse
into the verdict's type. Phase 10's three `Decidable` instances
re-route through `.isAccept`; Phase 7's
`countMatroid_indep_iff_runPebbleGame` restates against the verdict.
The substantive prerequisite — a verified-iterative *computable*
`reachClosureComputable` in `Search/DFS.lean` — lands as Layer 1
and replaces the previous `Classical.decPred`-mediated reach
closure on `PartialOrientation`. Layer 5 bumps the CLI surface to
pattern-match on the verdict and emit `ARCS u v` / `BLOCKING n` +
`VERTEX w` lines alongside the trichotomy label, making the
classification externally checkable. The chapter ran in
**structural-edit mode** per `blueprint/DESIGN.md`: no new
blueprint chapter, with reshape lands distributed across
`chapter/{dfs,pebble-game,executable}.tex` alongside each Layer's
Lean. See `notes/Phase11.md` for the five-layer plan, the Layer 0
audit outcomes, architectural-choice list, and per-layer decision
records.

The body-bar program (Tay's theorem and beyond) was re-scoped from a
single blocked "Phase 12" into a dependency-ordered chain of four
phases (12–15) after a 2026-06 re-investigation. The matroid-union
machinery the original plan intended to *vendor* from `apnelson1/Matroid`
turned out to be already fully formalized there (zero-sorry) but
bit-rotted onto a superseded circuit-axiom constructor — so it is
promoted from an assumed-vendored "Layer 1" into a real local
formalization phase. See `notes/Phase12.md` *Prerequisites audit* for
the corrected analysis.

### Phase 12 — Matroid foundations: submodular functions & matroid union

Complete. Formalizes the abstract-matroid prerequisites of the body-bar
route, **locally** under `CombinatorialRigidity/Matroid/`: the
matroid-from-submodular-function construction and polymatroid rank formula
(Edmonds 1970), the matroid-union theorem (Nash-Williams 1966 / Edmonds)
with its independence characterization, Rado's theorem (Rado 1942), and
Edmonds' matroid-partition rank formula (Edmonds 1965). The Lean is
**ported from Peter Nelson's `apnelson1/Matroid`** (Apache-2.0), whose
shelved `WIP/{Submodular,Union}.lean` carry complete proofs, rebased onto
the package's live `FiniteCircuitMatroid` constructor — an explicit
exception to the "small upstream-eligible lemmas only" mirror convention
(see `DESIGN.md` *Local mirror of the matroid-union subsystem*). The phase
ran route (a), submodular-repair, chosen by the Layer-1 spike, in **forward
blueprint mode** with `blueprint/src/chapter/matroid-union.tex` as the
authoritative dep-graph. See `notes/Phase12.md` for the Layer plan, the
prerequisites audit, the per-layer decision records, and the attribution
discipline.

### Phase 13 — Tutte–Nash-Williams tree-packing

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase13.md`).** Specialized Phase 12's
matroid-partition theorem to `k` copies of `Graph.cycleMatroid`,
recovering Tutte–Nash-Williams tree-packing (Tutte 1961, Nash-Williams
1961): `Graph.tutte_nash_williams` (a multigraph is the edge-disjoint
union of `k` forests iff it is `(k,k)`-sparse) and the connected-tight
spanning-tree refinement `Graph.isSpanningTreePacking_of_isTight`
(`cor:k-spanning-trees`, Whiteley Thm 13). Introduced a `Graph`-native
`Set`-side `(k,ℓ)`-sparsity/tightness predicate (`Graph.IsSparse` /
`Graph.IsTight`, fresh — **not** migrated from the Phase 9/10
`SimpleGraph` sparsity; see `DESIGN.md` *Migrating Phases 1–11 …* and
*Set/Finset and rank-flavor boundary at the matroid layer (Phases
13–15)*) and a thin rank adapter (`Matroid.Union_pow_rank_eq`,
`Union_pow_indep_iff_count`) bridging the partition formula to the
`k`-fold `cycleMatroid` case. Carrier: mathlib core `Graph α β`.
Per-node lemma map + decisions: `notes/Phase13.md` and the
*Tree-packing as a corollary* subsection of `body-bar.tex`. Unblocks
Phase 14 (`k`-frame matroid = `k`-fold cycle-matroid union).

### Phase 14 — k-frame matroid = k-fold cycle-matroid union

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase14.md`).** Whiteley 1988 Theorem 1:
the generic `k`-frame matroid `F(G,X)` on a multigraph (a linear matroid
via `Matroid.ofFun` over indeterminate coefficients
`KFrameField β k = FractionRing (MvPolynomial (β × Fin k) ℚ)`) equals the
`k`-fold union of `Graph.cycleMatroid`, restricted to `E(G)`:
`Graph.kFrameMatroid_eq_unionPow_cycleMatroid`. Whiteley §2.1's genericity
argument runs as a rank count forward (`Graph.forest_count_of_linearIndepOn_kFrameRow`)
and a forest-packing block-diagonal specialization reverse
(`Graph.linearIndepOn_kFrameRow_of_isSparse_restrict`); the two halves package
into the count bridge `Graph.kFrameMatroid_indep_iff_isSparse_restrict`, which
matches Phase 13's `unionPow_cycleMatroid_indep_iff_isSparse_restrict` by
`Matroid.ext_indep`. The `↾ E(G)` is forced: the vendored `Matroid.Union` has
ground `univ : Set β`, so the bare equality is unprovable (the matroids agree on
independent sets but the union carries every non-edge as a loop). Carrier:
mathlib core `Graph α β`. Bridges Phase 12's abstract union to the body-bar
realizations of Phase 15. Per-node lemma map + decisions (incl. the coefficient
encoding and the ground-set restriction): `notes/Phase14.md` and the
`sec:body-bar-k-frame` dep-graph of `body-bar.tex`. Unblocks Phase 15.

### Phase 15 — Body-bar Tay theorem (existence form)

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase15.md`).** The original Phase-12
target, unblocked by the Phase 12–14 chain. Tay's theorem in the
existence-of-realization form (Whiteley 1988 Theorem 8, Tay 1984): for
`d = bodyBarDim n = n(n+1)/2`, a multigraph `G` carries an independent
body-bar framework in `ℝⁿ` iff `G` is `(d,d)`-sparse, and an isostatic
one iff `(d,d)`-tight — `Graph.BodyBarFramework.tay_witness`, the iff of
the standard-basis witness (`exists_isIndependent_of_isSparse` /
`exists_isIsostatic_of_isTight`, via `tutte_nash_williams` +
block-diagonal rank count `stdFramework_finrank_range`) with the
converse (`isSparse_of_isIndependent`). The converse is the body-bar
analogue of Phase 6's `isSparse_of_edgeSetRowIndependent_dim_two`: the
block-diagonal rank upper bound `finrank_rigidityRow_span_le`
(`finrank (span (rows on E')) ≤ d·r(E')`, the real specialization of
Phase 14's `forest_count_of_linearIndepOn_kFrameRow`, via a general-
placement row identity `rigidityRow_eq` factoring each row through
`blockPairing`) plus the cycle-matroid bound `r(E')+1 ≤ |V'|`. Carrier:
mathlib core `Graph α β`; Plücker/two-extensor coordinates handled
inline (degenerate permitted, standard-basis witness only). Whiteley's
"almost all realizations are rigid" irreducible-variety lift is
**deferred** to the body-hinge phase. Forward-mode phase: per-node lemma
map + decisions in `notes/Phase15.md` and the `sec:body-bar-framework` +
`sec:body-bar-tay` dep-graph of `body-bar.tex`.

### Phase 16 — Body-hinge Tay–Whiteley theorem (existence form)

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase16.md`).** The natural follow-on
to Phase 15's body-bar Tay theorem. The **body-hinge / panel-hinge
Tay–Whiteley theorem** in `n`-space (Tay 1989, Whiteley 1988),
existence-of-realization form, **via the matroid-union reduction to
Phase 15**: a *hinge* in `ℝⁿ` constrains all but one of the
`δ = bodyBarDim n = n(n+1)/2` relative screw freedoms of the two bodies
it joins, so it behaves like a bundle of `δ−1` coincident body-bars.
The chapter adds *no new linear algebra* — parallel-edge multiplication
`(δ−1)·G` (`Graph.edgeMultiply`, the multiplied graph of Katoh–Tanigawa
2011's molecular conjecture) plus its three transport facts is the only
device; a body-hinge framework on `G` (`Graph.BodyHingeFramework`) is
*defined* as the induced body-bar framework on `(δ−1)·G`
(`toBodyBar`), with independence / infinitesimal rigidity inherited
verbatim. The target `Graph.BodyHingeFramework.body_hinge_tay`: `G`
carries an independent (resp. isostatic) body-hinge framework in `ℝⁿ`
iff `(δ−1)·G` is `(δ,δ)`-sparse (resp. tight), equivalently the
edge-disjoint union of `δ` forests — `edgeMultiply_isSparse_iff`
(`tay_witness` on `(δ−1)·G` transported across the body-hinge ⇔
body-bar bijection `exists_toBodyBar_iff`) composed with
`tutte_nash_williams`. Carrier: mathlib core `Graph α β`;
standard-basis witness only (degenerate permitted), matching Phase 15;
Whiteley's "almost all realizations are rigid" lift remains deferred.
Forward-mode phase. Per-node lemma map + decisions: `notes/Phase16.md`
and the `sec:body-hinge` dep-graph of `body-hinge.tex`.

### Phase 17+ — The Molecular Conjecture program

**Status: Phases 17–19 complete; Phases 20–26 planned.** The
longer-horizon target is the
**molecular conjecture** (panel-and-hinge with hinges at each body
forced concurrent/coplanar; Tay–Whiteley 1984, proved by Katoh–Tanigawa
2011, Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, 647–700). It is the project's
largest single undertaking — comparable in effort to Phases 1–16
combined — and is scoped as a **10-phase program (17–26)** delivering
the full conjecture *and* its molecule/`G²` application. The
lemma-level breakdown, reuse map, citations, and risk register live in
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`; this section is the one-paragraph-each
summary.

The proof (KT) splits into a **combinatorial step** (a graph-induction
generating minimal `k`-dof-graphs via splitting-off and rigid-subgraph
contraction; §3–4, Thm 4.9) and an **algebraic step** (a geometric
induction realizing each move at the target rigidity-matrix rank; §5–6,
Thm 5.5 → 5.6). Unlike Phases 15–16 (which defined body-hinge rigidity
*by reduction* to body-bar, standard-basis witness only), the conjecture
forces the **genuine panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)`** with real
extensor geometry and honest rank computations on *specific,
non-generic* (coplanar/concurrent) realizations.

Phase map (floor; 18/21/22-23 may each split on contact):

1. **17** — Grassmann–Cayley extensor algebra + the load-bearing
   independence Lemma 2.1 (§2.1). All new linear algebra.
2. **18** — the genuine panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)`, rank
   Lemmas 5.1–5.3, and reconciliation with Phase 16's reduction-form
   Prop 1.1 (§2.2–2.4).
3. **19** — `M(G̃)`, `D`-deficiency, `k`-dof / minimal `k`-dof-graphs,
   rigid subgraphs, the def=corank bridge (§2.5, §3). `M(G̃)` is the
   `ℓ=2k=D` boundary regime — the Phase 13/14 `D`-fold graphic union +
   Tutte–Nash-Williams, **not** the `ℓ<2k` `CountMatroid.lean`.
4. **20** — the combinatorial induction: graph operations + forest
   surgery (4.1/4.2) + Theorem 4.9 (§4).
5. **21** — Theorem 5.5 base + Case I (proper rigid subgraph) + Case II
   (`k>0` splitting = Whiteley 1-extension) (§5, §6.1–6.3).
6. **22** — Case III at `d=3` (Lemma 6.10): the `D`-candidate-frameworks
   argument, Claims 6.11/6.12 (the crux, §6.4.1).
7. **23** — Case III general `d` (Lemma 6.13) → Thm 5.5 → Thm 5.6 →
   Conjecture 1.2 (§6.4.2, §5.2).
8. **24** — the 3-D generic bar-joint rigidity matroid (linear-matroid
   form; dim-3 specialization of Phase 4/8). *Not* a Laman-3D
   characterization — general 3-D rigidity is open (KT §7).
9. **25** — Crapo–Whiteley projective invariance + the molecule ↔
   hinge-concurrent body-hinge ↔ panel-hinge modelling equivalence
   (§1.2).
10. **26** — Corollary 5.7 (`r(G²) = 3|V| − 6 − def(G̃)`), the
    protein-flexibility / pebble-game-validity capstone.

**Phase 17 is complete** (work log: `notes/Phase17.md`; forward-mode
chapter: `blueprint/src/chapter/molecular.tex`). It formalized the
Grassmann–Cayley / extensor-algebra layer (KT §2.1) in
`Molecular/Extensor.lean` end to end: homogeneous coordinatization, the
affine-independence ↔ top-extensor bridge, the symbolic extensor/join on
mathlib's `ExteriorAlgebra ℝ (Fin (d+1) → ℝ)` (`ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti` +
exterior product), the coordinatized Plücker bridge (`pluckerCoord` /
`pluckerVector`, signed `j×j`-minor vectors with KT's sign), the
affine-subspace extensor `C(·)`, and **Lemma 2.1** — the independence of
the `D = (d+1 choose 2)` many `(d−1)`-extensors of `d+1` affinely
independent points (`omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent`), on which the
conjecture's hardest case (Case III, Phases 22–23) bottoms out. Phases
20–26 remain planned — see `notes/MolecularConjecture.md` for the
per-phase detail and the reuse map.

### Phase 18 — Panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` (KT §2.2–2.4, §5 prep)

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase18.md`).** Stratum 2 of the
molecular-conjecture program: the **genuine** panel-hinge / body-hinge
rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` (`Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean`), building on
Phase 17's extensors and superseding Phase 16's reduction-only
`BodyHingeFramework` as the rank form. A body-hinge framework `(G,p)`
assigns a `(d−2)`-affine hinge to each edge; its supporting
`(d−1)`-extensor `C(p(e))` constrains the screw centers (carried as the
degree-`k` graded piece `⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)`, `finrank = D` via
`screwSpace_finrank`) by `S(u) − S(v) ∈ span C(p(e))`. Landed basis-free:
the hinge constraint + dual-annihilator row block + null space
`Z(G,p) = infinitesimalMotions`; the trivial-motion layer with the
`D`-dimensional + `D·|V|` numeric counts (the codimension form of
`rank R ≤ D(|V|−1)`); and the three rank lemmas — 5.1 pin-a-body
(`finrank_pinnedMotions_add_screwDim`, the [29] fact *proved* via the
relative-screw normalization), 5.3 parallel-hinges-full
(`eq_of_hingeConstraint_two_parallel`, the `|V|=2` base case), 5.2
rotation semicontinuity (`finrank_infinitesimalMotions_le_of_span_le`,
span-refinement monotonicity, genericity over analytic perturbation). The
KT Prop 1.1 reconciliation (`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`, reconcile the
rank form with Phase 16's `thm:body-hinge-tay`) was originally deferred to
Phase 19; at Phase-19 close it was **relocated forward to Phase 21+** — its
matroidal half (`def(G̃) = corank M(G̃)`) landed green in Phase 19, but its
analytic half (`rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`) depends on the Claim 6.4
generic-rank argument and lands with the algebraic induction. Forward-mode
(the dep-graph is `rigidity-matrix.tex`'s `sec:molecular-rigidity-matrix`;
the post-Phase-18 cleanup round split the former `molecular.tex` into
`extensor.tex` (Phase 17) + `rigidity-matrix.tex` (Phase 18), one `.tex` per
molecular phase). Per-lemma detail + decisions: `notes/Phase18.md`; the
relocated node is a Phase-21+ deliverable in `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`.

### Phase 19 — `M(G̃)`, deficiency, `k`-dof graphs (KT §2.5, §3)

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase19.md`).** Stratum 3 of the
molecular-conjecture program: the combinatorial / matroidal substrate
the algebraic induction (Phases 21–23) runs against. In a new file
`Molecular/Deficiency.lean`, the matroid `M(G̃)` (the `(D,D)`-count
matroid of `G̃ = (D−1)·G` at the **boundary regime `ℓ = 2k = D`** — the
`D`-fold graphic-matroid union of Phases 13/14 + Tutte–Nash-Williams,
**not** the `ℓ<2k` `CountMatroid.lean`), the `D`-deficiency
`def(G̃) = maxₚ [D(|P|−1) − (D−1)·d_G(P)]`, the `k`-dof / minimal-`k`-dof
hierarchy, rigid + proper rigid subgraphs (KT Lemmas 3.1/3.3/3.4), and
the **def = corank bridge** `|B| + def(G̃) = D(|V|−1)` (project framing
of Jackson–Jordán 2009 Thm 6.1 / Cor 6.2, proved in-repo axiom-free via
weak duality + the Edmonds-optimal-`Y₀` reverse). The bridge is the
matroidal half of KT Prop 1.1 (reconciling the honest rank form with
Phase 16's reduction form); the analytic half (`rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) −
def(G̃)`) relocated forward to the algebraic-induction phases (21+).
Forward-mode; dep-graph `deficiency.tex` `sec:molecular-deficiency`.
Per-node lemma map + decisions: `notes/Phase19.md`. Unblocks Phase 20
(combinatorial induction → Theorem 4.9).

### Phase 20 — Combinatorial induction → Theorem 4.9 (KT §3.4–3.5, §4)

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase20.md`).** Stratum 4 of the
molecular-conjecture program: the **combinatorial** half of
Katoh–Tanigawa's proof, landed in `Molecular/Induction.lean`. The
graph operations on `Graph α β` (vertex removal, splitting-off at a
degree-2 vertex, edge-splitting, rigid-subgraph contraction), the
KT 3.4/3.5 chain (rigid-subgraph form of circuits; contraction
preserves minimality — the Case I engine), the dof-tracking bounds
(KT 4.3–4.5) and the reducible-vertex / reduction-step lemmas (KT
4.6–4.8), and the capstone **Theorem 4.9** `Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction`
(green, axiom-free): every minimal `0`-dof-graph with `|V| ≥ 2` reduces
to the two-vertex double edge, stated as the well-founded induction
principle the reduction dichotomy + vertex-count measure drive. Two
route findings recorded in `notes/Phase20.md`: KT Lemma 4.1 is
over-quantified with a balanced-packing gloss in its proof (formalized
counterexample; routed around via a deficiency-count argument), and KT's
iterated fundamental-circuit swaps for the dof bounds and the
minimality transport are bypassed by partition-count / rank-count
comparisons through the green `def = corank` bridge. The forest-surgery
core (KT 4.1) is off the Theorem-4.9 critical path but fully landed (the
`-split` direction green, balanced-packing gloss discharged as a GAP not
an error); only the edge-splitting inverse KT 4.2 stays a deferred TODO.
Per-node lemma map + decisions + findings:
`notes/Phase20.md`. Unblocks Phase 21 (algebraic induction base +
Cases I & II).

### Phase 21 — Algebraic induction: Theorem 5.5 base + Cases I & II (KT §5, §6.1–6.3)

**Status (◷ in progress, paused for a panel re-scope; see
`notes/Phase21.md`).** Mid-phase (2026-06-03) a modeling correction
surfaced: KT's *panel-hinge* framework is a *hinge-coplanar* body-hinge
framework, and the conjecture's content is that coplanarity does not drop
rigidity — but the Phase-18 `BodyHingeFramework` carries free hinges with
no coplanarity, so the realization-existence nodes as first drafted prove
the (weaker) body-hinge rank theorem. The fix is a **panel layer**, gated
on a new foundations sub-phase **Phase 21a** (Grassmann–Cayley meet /
projective duality). The regime-agnostic rank nodes landed so far stay
green. Full decision: `DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge = hinge-coplanar
body-hinge*; risk #7 + Phase-21a detail in `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`;
`notes/Phase21a.md`. Stratum 5 of the
molecular-conjecture program: the *algebraic* half of Katoh–Tanigawa's
proof, opened in a new file `Molecular/AlgebraicInduction.lean`. Where
Phase 20 reduced every minimal `0`-dof-graph to the two-vertex double
edge combinatorially (Theorem 4.9), this phase realizes that reduction at
the rigidity-matrix rank: KT **Theorem 5.5** (every minimal `k`-dof-graph
`G` with `|V| ≥ 2` has a panel-hinge realization with `rank R(G,p) =
D(|V|−1) − k`), its base case (`|V|=2`, via the green parallel-hinges
Lemma 5.3), **Case I** (proper rigid subgraph — rigid-subgraph contraction
+ block-triangular gluing via the green pin-a-body Lemma 5.1), and **Case
II** (`k>0` splitting — the panel-hinge analogue of Whiteley's bar-joint
1-extension). The induction is driven by the *same* reduction dichotomy
Phase 20's `minimal_kdof_reduction` exposes as a well-founded induction
principle. The crux **Case III** (`k=0`, no proper rigid subgraph) is
deferred to Phases 22–23. The new analytic device is the Claim 6.4 / 6.9
genericity argument (matrix entries are polynomials in algebraically
independent panel coordinates ⇒ a generic point attains the maximum rank);
the cycle-realization Lemma 5.4 (Crapo–Whiteley 1982) enters as an input.
The relocated **analytic half of KT Prop 1.1** (`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`,
`rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`, JJ 2009 Thm 6.1 geometric side) lands
with the Claim 6.4 argument; its matroidal half (`def = corank M(G̃)`) is
already green (Phase 19). Forward-mode; dep-graph `algebraic-induction.tex`
`sec:molecular-algebraic-induction`. Per-node lemma map + decisions:
`notes/Phase21.md`; program-level plan in `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`
*Phase 21*.

## Engineering conventions

- **Namespace.** Everything sits inside `SimpleGraph` or
  `CombinatorialRigidity`. No top-level identifiers. **Exception
  (Phases 12–15):** the body-bar program adds `Matroid`-namespace defs
  (the ported submodular/union machinery, beside `Matroid.cycleMatroid`)
  and `Graph`-namespace defs (graph-level `kFrameMatroid` / sparsity, for
  dot-notation on `G : Graph α β`); framework defs stay under
  `CombinatorialRigidity`/`BodyBar`. See `notes/Phase12.md` and
  ROADMAP §15.
- **Vertex types.** Use `V : Type*` and `[Finite V]` (the weakest
  reasonable typeclass) in signatures whenever the *statement* works
  at that strength — this is the strongest mathematical claim, the
  one that applies most generally. When a proof body needs
  `Fintype V`-strength data (e.g. `Finset.univ`, `Fintype.card V`),
  bridge inline with `haveI : Fintype V := Fintype.ofFinite V`; for
  `Finset V` operations needing `DecidableEq V`, follow with
  `classical`. This is the mathlib idiom (enforced by the
  `unusedFintypeInType` env linter). Use `[Fintype V]` in the
  signature only when the *type* itself mentions `Fintype.card V`,
  `Finset.univ : Finset V`, or similar `Fintype`-flavored objects.
  Edge counts use `Set.ncard` so we don't force decidability of edge
  predicates. See `DESIGN.md` *Typeclass shape for finiteness on `V`*
  for the rationale (Phase 7 cleanup round resolution; two earlier
  iterations were considered and reversed). Algorithm-bearing files
  (`Search/DFS.lean`, `PebbleGame/`) deliberately depart from this
  rule and take `[Fintype V] [DecidableEq V]` end-to-end as a
  localized style island — the state machines iterate over
  `Finset V` / `Finset (V × V)` directly, and `#eval` / `decide`
  must fire on extracted certificates. See `DESIGN.md`
  *Pebble-game style island: `[Fintype V] [DecidableEq V]`* for the
  rationale + the math-layer / exec-layer (`-With`) split that keeps
  the island from contaminating the rest of the project's API.
- **Cardinalities.** Use `Set.ncard` for sets and `Finset.card` for finsets.
  Avoid `ℕ`-subtraction; rephrase `a ≤ b − c` as `a + c ≤ b`.
- **Style.** Module docstrings at the top of each file (`/-! # Title -/`).
  One declaration ↔ one purpose. Comments only when *why* is non-obvious.
- **Imports.** Each file imports the minimum it needs. `Sparsity.lean`
  should import only `SimpleGraph.Basic` + `Set.Card` + minor friends.
- **Decidability.** Add `[DecidableEq V]` / `[DecidableRel G.Adj]` only
  when a body genuinely builds specific `Finset V` / `Adj`-iterating
  objects. `classical` at the proof top is the acceptable alternative
  when adding the typeclass to the signature isn't worth the API
  noise. Many definitions can stay noncomputable via `Set.ncard`.
- **Predicates are `def`s, not `abbrev`s.** `IsSparse`, `IsTight`,
  `IsLaman`, and `edgesIn` are non-reducible. `grind` will not unfold
  them on its own. To break an `IsTight`/`IsLaman` goal into parts use
  `refine ⟨?_, ?_⟩`; for an `edgesIn` membership use the corresponding
  `mem_*` simp lemma. See `TACTICS-GOLF.md` § 4 for the full discussion.
- **Missing mathlib lemmas.** If you need a lemma that genuinely
  belongs upstream, put it under `Mathlib/<exact mathlib path>` so
  promotion is later a copy-paste. The directory is created lazily;
  don't pre-populate. See `DESIGN.md` "Mirror directory".
- **Tactic notes.** Practical guidance on `grind` (preferred closing
  tactic in this directory), the `Set.ncard` autoparam pattern, the
  mirror-first rule, and other cross-cutting idioms all live in
  `TACTICS-GOLF.md`. When in doubt, read it — the section TL;DRs are
  short and save iteration time.
- **No prose counts in shared docs.** Don't write "Phase X surfaced
  N upstream candidates" or similar in `ROADMAP.md`, `DESIGN.md`, or
  `TACTICS-GOLF.md` — counts drift the moment a new phase mirrors more
  lemmas. Link to `notes/FRICTION.md` "Mirrored" (or the mirror
  directory listing) as the source of truth instead.

## Working on the project

The per-session workflow (starting / working / friction review at
end-of-session / leave-it-ready-for-the-next-agent), and the
`notes/PhaseN.md` template, live in `CLAUDE.md`. Agents: read that
first.
