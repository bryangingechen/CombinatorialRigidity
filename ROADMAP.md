# Combinatorial Rigidity — Roadmap

This directory aims to formalize a slice of **combinatorial rigidity theory**
in mathlib style, culminating in **Laman's theorem** (1970): a graph on
`n ≥ 2` vertices is generically rigid in the plane iff it contains a
spanning subgraph with `2n − 3` edges in which every subgraph on `k ≥ 2`
vertices has at most `2k − 3` edges. Such graphs are called *Laman graphs*
or *minimally rigid* graphs in the plane.

The work is expected to span multiple sessions. This file is the canonical
hand-off document: it carries the directory layout, status, mathematical
plan, and engineering conventions. Read it after `CLAUDE.md`.

> **Agents:** start with `CLAUDE.md` (the agent operating manual covering
> reading order, per-session workflow, friction review, and the
> `notes/PhaseN.md` template). This file is the *what*; CLAUDE.md is the
> *how*.
>
> Design rationale (why these choices and not others) lives in
> `DESIGN.md`. Open it only when you actually need to question a
> decision; otherwise this file is sufficient.

The Status table is a **thin index**: each cell is a status marker plus
at most one short scope clause and a `(see notes/PhaseN.md)` pointer —
**never** a phase summary. The one-paragraph summary lives in the
per-phase prose under *Mathematical roadmap* (§N) below; the lemma list
and decisions live in `notes/PhaseN.md`. A cell that grows past a clause
or two has absorbed content that belongs in §N — re-thin it.

Phase-level details (per-phase lemma checklists, decisions made during
that phase, hand-off notes) live under `notes/PhaseN.md`. Read those
when picking up a phase or reviewing how an earlier phase was finished.

**Cleanup rounds** between phases get their own work log under
`notes/PhaseN-cleanup.md` (named to sort next to the prior phase's
notes) and a row in this table for visibility. Round-level discipline
lives in `CLEANUP.md` at the repo root.

Add lemmas in the file that introduces the relevant definition; a
lemma about `IsSparse` belongs in `Sparsity.lean`, not in `Laman.lean`,
even if it is first used there. When starting a new phase, create the
corresponding `notes/PhaseN.md` file in your first commit.

## Mathematical roadmap

We follow the **Henneberg construction** route, which is elementary and
matches mathlib's combinatorics style. The matroid-theoretic route via
`Mathlib.Combinatorics.Matroid` is left as a future alternative framing.

### Phase 1 — Sparsity (`EdgesIn.lean`, `Sparsity.lean`, `Laman.lean`)

Complete. Defines `edgesIn`, `IsSparse`, `IsTight`, `IsLaman` and the
basic API (monotonicity, subgraph preservation, global edge bound,
vertex partition). See `notes/Phase1.md` for the full lemma list and
phase-specific decisions.

### Phase 2 — Laman graphs (`Laman.lean`)

Complete. Builds the Laman API on top of the Phase 1 `IsLaman`
definition: the `(2, 3)`-tightness `iff` unfolding, the K₂ base case
(promoted to a named theorem), and the degree results that feed into
the Henneberg induction (minimum degree ≥ 2 for `n ≥ 3`; existence of
a degree-2-or-3 vertex). See `notes/Phase2.md` for the full lemma list
and phase-specific decisions.

### Phase 3 — Henneberg moves (`Henneberg.lean`)

Complete. Type I and Type II moves on simple graphs (fresh vertex as
`none : Option V`, old vertices via `some`). Both moves preserve the
Laman property (`typeI_isLaman`, `typeII_isLaman`); both edge-set
decompositions land (`typeI_edgeSet[_ncard]`, `typeII_edgeSet[_ncard]`).
Iso transport (`IsSparse.iso`, `IsTight.iso`, `IsLaman.iso`, plus
`Iso.image_edgesIn`) lifts Laman across graph isomorphisms. The
`K₄ \ e` worked example (`top_fin_four_minus_edge_isLaman`) ties
these together. The canonical iso constructors
`typeI_iso_of_two_neighbors` and `typeII_iso_of_three_neighbors`
package the iso `G ≃g typeI G' a b` (resp. `…typeII…`) from
neighborhood data at a chosen vertex; downstream phases consume these
to bridge flat-form reverse decompositions with operation-form forward
preservation theorems.

The structural decomposition theorem
(`IsLaman.exists_typeI_or_typeII_reverse`, now in flat form per Phase 7
Commit 6) lives in `Henneberg.lean`. Phase 3 originally shipped only
the iso-only half (no `G'.IsLaman` claim) because the typeII reverse
can fail for an arbitrary non-adjacent pair (concrete 6-vertex
counter-example in `notes/Phase3.md`); the strengthened claim with
`G'.IsLaman` was deferred to Phase 5 — see §5 below — and re-presented
in flat form in Phase 7.

See `notes/Phase3.md` for the full lemma list and phase-specific
decisions.

Both moves additionally preserve generic rigidity (TODO in Phase 5,
because the proof needs the typeII reverse blocker argument).

### Phase 4 — Frameworks and infinitesimal rigidity (`Framework.lean`)

Complete. Defines `Framework V d` as `V → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`,
the `RigidityMap G p` as an `ℝ`-linear map (the matrix view via
`LinearMap.toMatrix` is deferred until needed), `IsInfinitesimallyRigid
G p` as the kernel-dimension bound `dim ker ≤ d(d+1)/2`, and
`IsGenericallyRigid G d` as existence of an infinitesimally rigid
placement. Ships the basic `RigidityMap` API (`Framework.finrank`,
`rigidityMap_apply`, `rigidityMap_ker_mono`,
`rigidityMap_finrank_range_le`), the graph-monotonicity corollaries
(`IsInfinitesimallyRigid.mono`, `IsGenericallyRigid.mono`), the main
edge-count theorem `IsGenericallyRigid.card_mul_le` (`d * #V ≤ #E +
d(d+1)/2` for any generically rigid graph), and the K₂ worked example
`top_fin_two_isGenericallyRigid`. The `TrivialMotions` API (textbook
identification of kernel with rigid motions) and the
`finrank_trivialMotions_eq_of_affinelySpanning` lemma were deferred
in Phase 4 (neither was on the critical path for Phase 5) and landed
in Phase 6's `TrivialMotions.lean`. See `notes/Phase4.md` for the full
lemma list and phase-specific decisions.

### Phase 5 — Laman's theorem, (⇐) direction (`LamanTheorem.lean`, `HennebergRigidity.lean`)

Complete. The main iff statement lives in `LamanTheorem.lean`:
```
theorem SimpleGraph.isGenericallyRigid_two_iff_exists_isLaman_le
    {V : Type*} [Fintype V] (G : SimpleGraph V) (h : 2 ≤ Fintype.card V) :
    G.IsGenericallyRigid 2 ↔
      ∃ H : SimpleGraph V, H ≤ G ∧ H.IsLaman
```
*composed* from two named directional theorems —
`IsLaman.isGenericallyRigid_two` for (⇐), proved in Phase 5, and
`IsGenericallyRigid.exists_isLaman_le` for (⇒), `sorry`-blocked and
resolved in **Phase 6** (see §6 below).

**(⇐) recap.** Henneberg induction on `Fintype.card V`. K₂ base case
via `top_fin_two_isGenericallyRigidInj 1` + iso transport. Inductive
step via `IsLaman.exists_typeI_or_typeII_reverse` (strengthened
decomposition with `G'.IsLaman`, proved via the Henneberg blocker
argument) plus per-move rigidity preservation
(`typeI_isGenericallyRigidInj_two` /
`typeII_isGenericallyRigidInj_two`, both unconditional). The Type II
move's collinearity gap is discharged by `IsInfinitesimallyRigid.
eventually` (openness of IR via `LinearIndependent.eventually`) plus
a perpendicular perturbation packaged in
`exists_nonCollinear_rigid_placement_dim_two`. See `notes/Phase5.md`
for the full lemma list and proof techniques.

**Open refactor proposal** (not a blocker): the three contradiction
templates in the milestone-1 blocker argument
(`IsLaman.contradiction_{one,two,three}_pair`) plus the degree-3
dispatcher can be unified through two reusable `(k, ℓ)`-shaped
primitives, saving ~210 LoC. Full plan in `notes/Phase5.md`'s
appendix.

### Phase 6 — Laman's theorem, (⇒) direction (`LamanTheorem.lean`, `RigidityMatroid.lean`)

Complete. Builds the rigidity-matroid scaffolding in `RigidityMatroid.lean`
(row-independence, dual-module bridge, rank lower bound at generic
placement, rank upper bound at affinely-spanning placement, basis-pick),
then ships Lovász–Yemini's easy direction in dim 2:
`isSparse_of_edgeSetRowIndependent_dim_two` (row-independent edge sets
yield `(2, 3)`-sparse spanning subgraphs) and the assembly
`IsGenericallyRigid.exists_isLaman_le` (combine the affinely-spanning
rigid placement, basis-pick, and sparsity). The iff
`isGenericallyRigid_two_iff_exists_isLaman_le` in `LamanTheorem.lean`
now closes both directions. Phase 4 deliberately kept `Framework.lean`
matroid-agnostic (see DESIGN.md *Notion- and matroid-agnostic core*);
Phase 6 stood up `RigidityMatroid.lean` on top without packaging the
abstract `Matroid` instance, since the easy direction needs only the
row-independence relation and two linear-algebra facts.

The chapter ran in **forward blueprint mode** per `blueprint/DESIGN.md`
*Recommendation for Phase 6*: the blueprint chapter
`blueprint/src/chapter/laman-theorem.tex` (its $\Rightarrow$ subsection)
served as the authoritative dep-graph and lemma index throughout. See
`notes/Phase6.md` for the full lemma list and phase-specific decisions.

### Phase 7 — Lovász–Yemini matroid identification (`CountMatroid.lean`, `MatroidIdentification.lean`)

Complete. Phase 6 shipped the easy direction of Lovász–Yemini in dim 2
(row-independent $\Rightarrow$ $(2, 3)$-sparse). Phase 7 shipped the
converse, the general $(k, \ell)$-count matroid in the matroidal regime
$\ell < 2k$ (Whiteley 1996, Lee--Streinu 2008), and the planar
rigidity-matroid specialisation. Hard-direction induction lives in
`MatroidIdentification.lean` and routes through the matroidal-regime
$I$-component scaffolding in `Sparsity.lean` (`IsSparse.maxBlock` and
edge-disjointness); the abstract `(k, \ell)`-count matroid sits in its
own file `CountMatroid.lean` via `IndepMatroid.ofFinite`. The phase ran
in **forward blueprint mode** with `blueprint/src/chapter/count-matroid.tex`
and `blueprint/src/chapter/rigidity-matroid.tex` as the authoritative
dep-graphs and lemma indices. See `notes/Phase7.md` for the full lemma
list and phase-specific decisions.

The **linear-matroid framing** of the rigidity matroid (the
generic-placement matroid $M_p$ on $E(K_V)$ via `Matroid.ofFun` for
some generic $p$, with Lovász--Yemini stated as a matroid iso
$M_{p_{\text{gen}}} \cong \mathrm{rigidityMatroid}\,V$) is deferred to
**Phase 8**, which will add `apnelson1/Matroid` as a dependency.

### Phase 8 — Linear-matroid framing (`LinearRigidityMatroid.lean`)

Complete. Packages the planar rigidity matroid in its linear-algebra
form via `Matroid.ofFun` (from the `apnelson1/Matroid` library) of
the rigidity-row function at a uniformly-generic placement, and
identifies it with the combinatorial $(2, 3)$-count matroid of
Phase 7 (Lovász--Yemini, linear-matroid form). The target
`linearRigidityMatroid_eq_rigidityMatroid` is package equality on
`Matroid (Sym2 V)`, since both matroids share ground set
$E(K_V)$; the content is uniform genericity
(`exists_uniform_rowIndependent_placement_dim_two`), proved by
linear-interpolation perturbation on the finite family of
$(2, 3)$-sparse subsets routed through two new mirror lemmas under
`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean` (rectangular Gram-det
characterization of LI; cofiniteness of LI along an affine line via
a one-variable real polynomial Gram determinant). The chapter ran in **forward
blueprint mode** with `blueprint/src/chapter/rigidity-matroid.tex`'s
*Linear-matroid framing* subsection as the authoritative dep-graph.
See `notes/Phase8.md` for the full lemma list, decisions, and
hand-off.

### Phase 9 — Pebble game (`PebbleGame/{Basic, Algorithm, Correctness}.lean`)

Complete. Formalizes the basic $(k, \ell)$-pebble game of
Lee--Streinu 2008 (generalising the original $(2, 3)$ algorithm of
Jacobs--Hendrickson 1997) end-to-end in the matroidal regime
$\ell < 2k$ matching Phase 7. The pebble game lives in a
`PebbleGame/` subdirectory split three ways post-Phase-9-perf
(see `notes/PERFORMANCE.md` *Split candidates ranked by leverage*
item 5 for the file-size-driven split rationale):
`PebbleGame/Basic.lean` carries state + invariants;
`PebbleGame/Algorithm.lean` the three-layer algorithm chain;
`PebbleGame/Correctness.lean` the correctness theorems and the
matroidal-independence corollary. The chapter ships the
`PartialOrientation V` state (bundled `Finset (V × V)` with
`no_loops` + `no_antiparallel`), the path-reversal and arc-insertion
moves with per-vertex and subset-level accounting lemmas, the
`Reachable k ℓ` inductive predicate packaging the algorithmic
state space, the four pebble-game invariants of L-S Lemma 10
(`Reachable.{out_le, peb_add_out_eq, pebOn_add_span_add_outOn,
pebOn_add_outOn_ge, span_add_le}`), and the three-layer algorithm
chain `tryReachPebbleWith → tryAddEdgeWith → runPebbleGameWith`
(each as a fully-computable workhorse with a thin noncomputable
math-layer wrapper specialising to `D.outList` / `G.edgeFinset`
enumeration). The certificate-form correctness theorem
`runPebbleGame_correct` (`G.IsSparse k ℓ ↔ ∃ D, runPebbleGame G k ℓ
= some D`) combines soundness `runPebbleGame_sound` (via the
`span_eq_ncard_edgesIn` bridge identity under
`runPebbleGame_underline_eq_edgeFinset`) with completeness
`runPebbleGame_eq_none_imp_exists_witness` (per-edge failure-witness
extraction routed through Lemma 13 algebraic core
`Reachable.independent_brings_pebble` and its SimpleGraph-form
wrapper). The matroidal-independence corollary
`SimpleGraph.countMatroid_indep_iff_runPebbleGame` follows as a
three-`rw` composition with Phase 7's `countMatroid_indep_iff`. A
pre-phase **DFS warmup** under `Search/DFS.lean` (modelled on
`Batteries.UnionFind`'s `termination_by` pattern) exercised the
verified-iterative-graph-search idiom in isolation; it ships the
`DirectedWalk` inductive, the `reachableFinding` primitive with
correctness theorem (soundness + completeness via
`DirectedWalk.dropUntilBundle` truncation), and the abstract
`reachClosure` over `Relation.ReflTransGen`. The chapter ran in
**forward blueprint mode** with
`blueprint/src/chapter/pebble-game.tex` as the authoritative
dep-graph. See `notes/Phase9.md` for the full lemma list,
decisions, and hand-off; the *component pebble game* (L-S §5,
$O(n^2)$ speedup via union pair-find) and the Henneberg-sequence
application (L-S §6) are deferred to potential follow-up phases.

### Phase 10 — Executable pebble game (`PebbleGame/{Exec, Examples}.lean`, `Main.lean`)

Complete. Bridges Phase 9's `noncomputable` `runPebbleGame` to an
actually-runnable decision procedure: the computable wrapper
`runPebbleGameExec` plugs `Finset.sort`-based list views (via
`outListSorted` for out-neighbour lists and `edgeListSorted` for
edges via the `Lex (V × V)` projection of `Sym2`) under
`[LinearOrder V]` into Phase 9's `-With` workhorses, lifts the
certificate-form correctness theorem to a workhorse-level
restatement that both the math-layer `runPebbleGame` and the new
`runPebbleGameExec` derive from as one-line corollaries, registers
the canonical `Decidable` instances for `IsSparse k ℓ` / `IsTight`
/ `IsLaman` (in the matroidal regime $\ell < 2k$, with a top-level
`Fact (3 < 2 * 2)` making the Laman case zero-hypothesis), and
ships a `lake exe pebble-game` CLI binary that reads an edge-list
file and prints `LAMAN` / `SPARSE_NOT_TIGHT` / `NOT_SPARSE`. Both
`#eval (decide G.IsLaman)` and the CLI reduce through the same
compiled `runPebbleGameExec` body. Chapter ran in **forward
blueprint mode** with `blueprint/src/chapter/executable.tex` as
the authoritative dep-graph. See `notes/Phase10.md` for the full
layer-by-layer summary and the architectural-choice list. The
blocking-witness extraction at the CLI's failure branch (which
also blocks an analogous orientation-witness extraction on the
success branch) was deferred during Layer 5 and is the focus of
**Phase 11** below.

### Phase 11 — Witness extraction (`Search/DFS.lean`, `PebbleGame/{Basic,Algorithm,Correctness,Exec}.lean`, `Main.lean`)

Complete. **Structural-edit phase** that maximally reshaped Phase
9/10's $\mathrm{Option}$-shaped pebble-game algorithms into the
verdict-bearing inductive `PebbleGameResult G k ℓ`, whose `.accept`
constructor carries the partial orientation $D$ and whose `.reject`
constructor carries the blocking subset $V'$. The workhorse-level
`tryAddEdgeWith` / `runPebbleGameWith` mirror-reshaped to
`Sum (WorkhorseWitness k ℓ V) (PartialOrientation V)`, with the
`independent_brings_pebble`-driven failure witness constructed
inline at case5 of `tryAddEdgeWith`'s recursion; Phase 9's
existence chain (`_isSome` / `_eq_none_imp_exists_witness`) is
absorbed and the certificate-form correctness theorems collapse
into the verdict's type. Phase 10's three `Decidable` instances
re-route through `.isAccept`; Phase 7's
`countMatroid_indep_iff_runPebbleGame` restates against the verdict.
The substantive prerequisite — a verified-iterative *computable*
`reachClosureComputable` in `Search/DFS.lean` — lands as Layer 1
and replaces the previous `Classical.decPred`-mediated reach
closure on `PartialOrientation`. Layer 5 bumps the CLI surface to
pattern-match on the verdict and emit `ARCS u v` / `BLOCKING n` +
`VERTEX w` lines alongside the trichotomy label, making the
classification externally checkable. The chapter ran in
**structural-edit mode** per `blueprint/DESIGN.md`: no new
blueprint chapter, with reshape lands distributed across
`chapter/{dfs,pebble-game,executable}.tex` alongside each Layer's
Lean. See `notes/Phase11.md` for the five-layer plan, the Layer 0
audit outcomes, architectural-choice list, and per-layer decision
records.

The body-bar program (Tay's theorem and beyond) was re-scoped from a
single blocked "Phase 12" into a dependency-ordered chain of four
phases (12–15) after a 2026-06 re-investigation. The matroid-union
machinery the original plan intended to *vendor* from `apnelson1/Matroid`
turned out to be already fully formalized there (zero-sorry) but
bit-rotted onto a superseded circuit-axiom constructor — so it is
promoted from an assumed-vendored "Layer 1" into a real local
formalization phase. See `notes/Phase12.md` *Prerequisites audit* for
the corrected analysis.

### Phase 12 — Matroid foundations: submodular functions & matroid union

Complete. Formalizes the abstract-matroid prerequisites of the body-bar
route, **locally** under `CombinatorialRigidity/Matroid/`: the
matroid-from-submodular-function construction and polymatroid rank formula
(Edmonds 1970), the matroid-union theorem (Nash-Williams 1966 / Edmonds)
with its independence characterization, Rado's theorem (Rado 1942), and
Edmonds' matroid-partition rank formula (Edmonds 1965). The Lean is
**ported from Peter Nelson's `apnelson1/Matroid`** (Apache-2.0), whose
shelved `WIP/{Submodular,Union}.lean` carry complete proofs, rebased onto
the package's live `FiniteCircuitMatroid` constructor — an explicit
exception to the "small upstream-eligible lemmas only" mirror convention
(see `DESIGN.md` *Local mirror of the matroid-union subsystem*). The phase
ran route (a), submodular-repair, chosen by the Layer-1 spike, in **forward
blueprint mode** with `blueprint/src/chapter/matroid-union.tex` as the
authoritative dep-graph. See `notes/Phase12.md` for the Layer plan, the
prerequisites audit, the per-layer decision records, and the attribution
discipline.

### Phase 13 — Tutte–Nash-Williams tree-packing

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase13.md`).** Specialized Phase 12's
matroid-partition theorem to `k` copies of `Graph.cycleMatroid`,
recovering Tutte–Nash-Williams tree-packing (Tutte 1961, Nash-Williams
1961): `Graph.tutte_nash_williams` (a multigraph is the edge-disjoint
union of `k` forests iff it is `(k,k)`-sparse) and the connected-tight
spanning-tree refinement `Graph.isSpanningTreePacking_of_isTight`
(`cor:k-spanning-trees`, Whiteley Thm 13). Introduced a `Graph`-native
`Set`-side `(k,ℓ)`-sparsity/tightness predicate (`Graph.IsSparse` /
`Graph.IsTight`, fresh — **not** migrated from the Phase 9/10
`SimpleGraph` sparsity; see `DESIGN.md` *Migrating Phases 1–11 …* and
*Set/Finset and rank-flavor boundary at the matroid layer (Phases
13–15)*) and a thin rank adapter (`Matroid.Union_pow_rank_eq`,
`Union_pow_indep_iff_count`) bridging the partition formula to the
`k`-fold `cycleMatroid` case. Carrier: mathlib core `Graph α β`.
Per-node lemma map + decisions: `notes/Phase13.md` and the
*Tree-packing as a corollary* subsection of `body-bar.tex`. Unblocks
Phase 14 (`k`-frame matroid = `k`-fold cycle-matroid union).

### Phase 14 — k-frame matroid = k-fold cycle-matroid union

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase14.md`).** Whiteley 1988 Theorem 1:
the generic `k`-frame matroid `F(G,X)` on a multigraph (a linear matroid
via `Matroid.ofFun` over indeterminate coefficients
`KFrameField β k = FractionRing (MvPolynomial (β × Fin k) ℚ)`) equals the
`k`-fold union of `Graph.cycleMatroid`, restricted to `E(G)`:
`Graph.kFrameMatroid_eq_unionPow_cycleMatroid`. Whiteley §2.1's genericity
argument runs as a rank count forward (`Graph.forest_count_of_linearIndepOn_kFrameRow`)
and a forest-packing block-diagonal specialization reverse
(`Graph.linearIndepOn_kFrameRow_of_isSparse_restrict`); the two halves package
into the count bridge `Graph.kFrameMatroid_indep_iff_isSparse_restrict`, which
matches Phase 13's `unionPow_cycleMatroid_indep_iff_isSparse_restrict` by
`Matroid.ext_indep`. The `↾ E(G)` is forced: the vendored `Matroid.Union` has
ground `univ : Set β`, so the bare equality is unprovable (the matroids agree on
independent sets but the union carries every non-edge as a loop). Carrier:
mathlib core `Graph α β`. Bridges Phase 12's abstract union to the body-bar
realizations of Phase 15. Per-node lemma map + decisions (incl. the coefficient
encoding and the ground-set restriction): `notes/Phase14.md` and the
`sec:body-bar-k-frame` dep-graph of `body-bar.tex`. Unblocks Phase 15.

### Phase 15 — Body-bar Tay theorem (existence form)

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase15.md`).** The original Phase-12
target, unblocked by the Phase 12–14 chain. Tay's theorem in the
existence-of-realization form (Whiteley 1988 Theorem 8, Tay 1984): for
`d = bodyBarDim n = n(n+1)/2`, a multigraph `G` carries an independent
body-bar framework in `ℝⁿ` iff `G` is `(d,d)`-sparse, and an isostatic
one iff `(d,d)`-tight — `Graph.BodyBarFramework.tay_witness`, the iff of
the standard-basis witness (`exists_isIndependent_of_isSparse` /
`exists_isIsostatic_of_isTight`, via `tutte_nash_williams` +
block-diagonal rank count `stdFramework_finrank_range`) with the
converse (`isSparse_of_isIndependent`). The converse is the body-bar
analogue of Phase 6's `isSparse_of_edgeSetRowIndependent_dim_two`: the
block-diagonal rank upper bound `finrank_rigidityRow_span_le`
(`finrank (span (rows on E')) ≤ d·r(E')`, the real specialization of
Phase 14's `forest_count_of_linearIndepOn_kFrameRow`, via a general-
placement row identity `rigidityRow_eq` factoring each row through
`blockPairing`) plus the cycle-matroid bound `r(E')+1 ≤ |V'|`. Carrier:
mathlib core `Graph α β`; Plücker/two-extensor coordinates handled
inline (degenerate permitted, standard-basis witness only). Whiteley's
"almost all realizations are rigid" irreducible-variety lift is
**deferred** to the body-hinge phase. Forward-mode phase: per-node lemma
map + decisions in `notes/Phase15.md` and the `sec:body-bar-framework` +
`sec:body-bar-tay` dep-graph of `body-bar.tex`.

### Phase 16 — Body-hinge Tay–Whiteley theorem (existence form)

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase16.md`).** The natural follow-on
to Phase 15's body-bar Tay theorem. The **body-hinge / panel-hinge
Tay–Whiteley theorem** in `n`-space (Tay 1989, Whiteley 1988),
existence-of-realization form, **via the matroid-union reduction to
Phase 15**: a *hinge* in `ℝⁿ` constrains all but one of the
`δ = bodyBarDim n = n(n+1)/2` relative screw freedoms of the two bodies
it joins, so it behaves like a bundle of `δ−1` coincident body-bars.
The chapter adds *no new linear algebra* — parallel-edge multiplication
`(δ−1)·G` (`Graph.edgeMultiply`, the multiplied graph of Katoh–Tanigawa
2011's molecular conjecture) plus its three transport facts is the only
device; a body-hinge framework on `G` (`Graph.BodyHingeFramework`) is
*defined* as the induced body-bar framework on `(δ−1)·G`
(`toBodyBar`), with independence / infinitesimal rigidity inherited
verbatim. The target `Graph.BodyHingeFramework.body_hinge_tay`: `G`
carries an independent (resp. isostatic) body-hinge framework in `ℝⁿ`
iff `(δ−1)·G` is `(δ,δ)`-sparse (resp. tight), equivalently the
edge-disjoint union of `δ` forests — `edgeMultiply_isSparse_iff`
(`tay_witness` on `(δ−1)·G` transported across the body-hinge ⇔
body-bar bijection `exists_toBodyBar_iff`) composed with
`tutte_nash_williams`. Carrier: mathlib core `Graph α β`;
standard-basis witness only (degenerate permitted), matching Phase 15;
Whiteley's "almost all realizations are rigid" lift remains deferred.
Forward-mode phase. Per-node lemma map + decisions: `notes/Phase16.md`
and the `sec:body-hinge` dep-graph of `body-hinge.tex`.

### Phase 17+ — The Molecular Conjecture program

**Status: Phases 17–22i (+ 21a/21b) complete; sub-phase 22j (the shared
eq.-(6.12) placement abstraction) is next, then 22k (completing the honest
all-`k` Theorem 5.5 + Thm 5.6 at `d=3`); Phases 23–26 planned.** The
longer-horizon target is the
**molecular conjecture** (panel-and-hinge with hinges at each body
forced concurrent/coplanar; Tay–Whiteley 1984, proved by Katoh–Tanigawa
2011, Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, 647–700). It is the project's
largest single undertaking — comparable in effort to Phases 1–16
combined — and is scoped as a **10-phase program (17–26)** delivering
the full conjecture *and* its molecule/`G²` application. The
lemma-level breakdown, reuse map, citations, and risk register live in
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`; this section is the one-paragraph-each
summary.

The proof (KT) splits into a **combinatorial step** (a graph-induction
generating minimal `k`-dof-graphs via splitting-off and rigid-subgraph
contraction; §3–4, Thm 4.9) and an **algebraic step** (a geometric
induction realizing each move at the target rigidity-matrix rank; §5–6,
Thm 5.5 → 5.6). Unlike Phases 15–16 (which defined body-hinge rigidity
*by reduction* to body-bar, standard-basis witness only), the conjecture
forces the **genuine panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)`** with real
extensor geometry and honest rank computations on *specific,
non-generic* (coplanar/concurrent) realizations.

Phase map (floor; 18/21/22-23 may each split on contact):

1. **17** — Grassmann–Cayley extensor algebra + the load-bearing
   independence Lemma 2.1 (§2.1). All new linear algebra.
2. **18** — the genuine panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)`, rank
   Lemmas 5.1–5.3, and reconciliation with Phase 16's reduction-form
   Prop 1.1 (§2.2–2.4).
3. **19** — `M(G̃)`, `D`-deficiency, `k`-dof / minimal `k`-dof-graphs,
   rigid subgraphs, the def=corank bridge (§2.5, §3). `M(G̃)` is the
   `ℓ=2k=D` boundary regime — the Phase 13/14 `D`-fold graphic union +
   Tutte–Nash-Williams, **not** the `ℓ<2k` `CountMatroid.lean`.
4. **20** — the combinatorial induction: graph operations + forest
   surgery (4.1/4.2) + Theorem 4.9 (§4).
5. **21** — Theorem 5.5 base + Case I (proper rigid subgraph) + Case II
   (`k>0` splitting = Whiteley 1-extension) (§5, §6.1–6.3).
6. **22** — sub-lettered. **22a** = Case I realization (full-rank
   rigid-subgraph splice, §6.2: `lem:case-I-realization`, green-modulo KT
   Claim 6.4). **22b** = KT Claim 6.4 (`lem:claim-6-4`, the discharge of
   22a's green-modulo obligation, §6.2/§5.1). **22c+** = Case III at
   `d=3` (Lemma 6.10: the `D`-candidate-frameworks argument, Claims
   6.11/6.12, the crux, §6.4.1) + the `d=3` assembly
   (`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` `hub` + `thm:theorem-55` flip), parked
   as a single planning placeholder behind 22a/22b (cut into sub-phases
   deferred until 22c opens; renumbered from `22b+` in the 22b opening
   recon).
7. **23** — Case III general `d` (Lemma 6.13) → Thm 5.5 → Thm 5.6 →
   Conjecture 1.2 (§6.4.2, §5.2).
8. **24** — the 3-D generic bar-joint rigidity matroid (linear-matroid
   form; dim-3 specialization of Phase 4/8). *Not* a Laman-3D
   characterization — general 3-D rigidity is open (KT §7).
9. **25** — Crapo–Whiteley projective invariance + the molecule ↔
   hinge-concurrent body-hinge ↔ panel-hinge modelling equivalence
   (§1.2).
10. **26** — Corollary 5.7 (`r(G²) = 3|V| − 6 − def(G̃)`), the
    protein-flexibility / pebble-game-validity capstone.

**Phase 17 is complete** (work log: `notes/Phase17.md`; forward-mode
chapter: `blueprint/src/chapter/molecular.tex`). It formalized the
Grassmann–Cayley / extensor-algebra layer (KT §2.1) in
`Molecular/Extensor.lean` end to end: homogeneous coordinatization, the
affine-independence ↔ top-extensor bridge, the symbolic extensor/join on
mathlib's `ExteriorAlgebra ℝ (Fin (d+1) → ℝ)` (`ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti` +
exterior product), the coordinatized Plücker bridge (`pluckerCoord` /
`pluckerVector`, signed `j×j`-minor vectors with KT's sign), the
affine-subspace extensor `C(·)`, and **Lemma 2.1** — the independence of
the `D = (d+1 choose 2)` many `(d−1)`-extensors of `d+1` affinely
independent points (`omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent`), on which the
conjecture's hardest case (Case III, Phases 22–23) bottoms out. Phases
23–26 remain planned — see `notes/MolecularConjecture.md` for the
per-phase detail and the reuse map.

### Phase 18 — Panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` (KT §2.2–2.4, §5 prep)

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase18.md`).** Stratum 2 of the
molecular-conjecture program: the **genuine** panel-hinge / body-hinge
rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` (`Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean`), building on
Phase 17's extensors and superseding Phase 16's reduction-only
`BodyHingeFramework` as the rank form. A body-hinge framework `(G,p)`
assigns a `(d−2)`-affine hinge to each edge; its supporting
`(d−1)`-extensor `C(p(e))` constrains the screw centers (carried as the
degree-`k` graded piece `⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)`, `finrank = D` via
`screwSpace_finrank`) by `S(u) − S(v) ∈ span C(p(e))`. Landed basis-free:
the hinge constraint + dual-annihilator row block + null space
`Z(G,p) = infinitesimalMotions`; the trivial-motion layer with the
`D`-dimensional + `D·|V|` numeric counts (the codimension form of
`rank R ≤ D(|V|−1)`); and the three rank lemmas — 5.1 pin-a-body
(`finrank_pinnedMotions_add_screwDim`, the [29] fact *proved* via the
relative-screw normalization), 5.3 parallel-hinges-full
(`eq_of_hingeConstraint_two_parallel`, the `|V|=2` base case), 5.2
rotation semicontinuity (`finrank_infinitesimalMotions_le_of_span_le`,
span-refinement monotonicity, genericity over analytic perturbation). The
KT Prop 1.1 reconciliation (`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`, reconcile the
rank form with Phase 16's `thm:body-hinge-tay`) was originally deferred to
Phase 19; at Phase-19 close it was **relocated forward to Phase 21+** — its
matroidal half (`def(G̃) = corank M(G̃)`) landed green in Phase 19, but its
analytic half (`rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`) depends on the Claim 6.4
generic-rank argument and lands with the algebraic induction. Forward-mode
(the dep-graph is `rigidity-matrix.tex`'s `sec:molecular-rigidity-matrix`;
the post-Phase-18 cleanup round split the former `molecular.tex` into
`extensor.tex` (Phase 17) + `rigidity-matrix.tex` (Phase 18), one `.tex` per
molecular phase). Per-lemma detail + decisions: `notes/Phase18.md`; the
relocated node is a Phase-21+ deliverable in `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`.

### Phase 19 — `M(G̃)`, deficiency, `k`-dof graphs (KT §2.5, §3)

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase19.md`).** Stratum 3 of the
molecular-conjecture program: the combinatorial / matroidal substrate
the algebraic induction (Phases 21–23) runs against. In a new file
`Molecular/Deficiency.lean`, the matroid `M(G̃)` (the `(D,D)`-count
matroid of `G̃ = (D−1)·G` at the **boundary regime `ℓ = 2k = D`** — the
`D`-fold graphic-matroid union of Phases 13/14 + Tutte–Nash-Williams,
**not** the `ℓ<2k` `CountMatroid.lean`), the `D`-deficiency
`def(G̃) = maxₚ [D(|P|−1) − (D−1)·d_G(P)]`, the `k`-dof / minimal-`k`-dof
hierarchy, rigid + proper rigid subgraphs (KT Lemmas 3.1/3.3/3.4), and
the **def = corank bridge** `|B| + def(G̃) = D(|V|−1)` (project framing
of Jackson–Jordán 2009 Thm 6.1 / Cor 6.2, proved in-repo axiom-free via
weak duality + the Edmonds-optimal-`Y₀` reverse). The bridge is the
matroidal half of KT Prop 1.1 (reconciling the honest rank form with
Phase 16's reduction form); the analytic half (`rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) −
def(G̃)`) relocated forward to the algebraic-induction phases (21+).
Forward-mode; dep-graph `deficiency.tex` `sec:molecular-deficiency`.
Per-node lemma map + decisions: `notes/Phase19.md`. Unblocks Phase 20
(combinatorial induction → Theorem 4.9).

### Phase 20 — Combinatorial induction → Theorem 4.9 (KT §3.4–3.5, §4)

**Status (✓ Complete; see `notes/Phase20.md`).** Stratum 4 of the
molecular-conjecture program: the **combinatorial** half of
Katoh–Tanigawa's proof, landed in `Molecular/Induction/`. The
graph operations on `Graph α β` (vertex removal, splitting-off at a
degree-2 vertex, edge-splitting, rigid-subgraph contraction), the
KT 3.4/3.5 chain (rigid-subgraph form of circuits; contraction
preserves minimality — the Case I engine), the dof-tracking bounds
(KT 4.3–4.5) and the reducible-vertex / reduction-step lemmas (KT
4.6–4.8), and the capstone **Theorem 4.9** `Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction`
(green, axiom-free): every minimal `0`-dof-graph with `|V| ≥ 2` reduces
to the two-vertex double edge, stated as the well-founded induction
principle the reduction dichotomy + vertex-count measure drive. Two
route findings recorded in `notes/Phase20.md`: KT Lemma 4.1 is
over-quantified with a balanced-packing gloss in its proof (formalized
counterexample; routed around via a deficiency-count argument), and KT's
iterated fundamental-circuit swaps for the dof bounds and the
minimality transport are bypassed by partition-count / rank-count
comparisons through the green `def = corank` bridge. The forest-surgery
core (KT 4.1) is off the Theorem-4.9 critical path but fully landed (the
`-split` direction green, balanced-packing gloss discharged as a GAP not
an error); only the edge-splitting inverse KT 4.2 stays a deferred TODO.
Per-node lemma map + decisions + findings:
`notes/Phase20.md`. Unblocks Phase 21 (algebraic induction base +
Cases I & II).

### Phase 21 — Algebraic induction: Theorem 5.5 base + Cases I & II (KT §5, §6.1–6.3)

**Status (✓ Complete, GREEN-modulo-21b; see `notes/Phase21.md`).** Stratum 5
of the molecular-conjecture program: the *algebraic* half of Katoh–Tanigawa's
proof, in a new file `Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/`. Where Phase 20
reduced every minimal `0`-dof-graph to the two-vertex double edge
combinatorially (Theorem 4.9), this phase realizes that reduction at the
rigidity-matrix rank: KT **Theorem 5.5** (`theorem_55`), its base case, **Case
I** (rigid-subgraph contraction + block-triangular gluing, `lem:case-I`),
**Case II** (`k>0` splitting = panel-hinge 1-extension, `lem:case-II`), and the
relocated **analytic half of KT Prop 1.1** (`rigidityMatrix_prop11`,
`rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`, JJ 2009 Thm 6.1 geometric side; matroidal
half `def = corank` green from Phase 19). The induction runs against the
*same* reduction dichotomy `minimal_kdof_reduction` exposes. Two re-scopes
landed at open (2026-06-03): a **panel layer** (hinge-coplanar body-hinge,
gated on the complete sub-phase **21a** Grassmann–Cayley meet), and the
**genericity scope-out** — the shared analytic crux Claim 6.4/6.9 is its own
sub-phase **21b**, entering each consuming node as an explicit hypothesis
(`hglue`/`hspan`/`hub`/`hgen`) so the surrounding reductions are fully formal
modulo it. The crux **Case III** (`k=0`, no proper rigid subgraph) is deferred
to Phases 22–23. Forward-mode; dep-graph `algebraic-induction.tex`
`sec:molecular-algebraic-induction`. Per-node lemma map + decisions:
`notes/Phase21.md`; `notes/Phase21a.md`; `DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge =
hinge-coplanar body-hinge* + *Genericity device (Claim 6.4/6.9) is its own
sub-phase (Phase 21b)*; program-level plan in `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`
*Phase 21* / *Phase 21b*.

### Phase 22 — Realization layer (sub-lettered: 22a + 22b + 22c + 22d + …)

The realization layer re-scoped out of Phase 21b — the Theorem-5.5 case
*producers* the genericity device feeds — was opened as a single Phase 22 on
2026-06-04 and **split into sub-phases the same day** because it over-broadly
bundled three independent bodies of work (Case I; Case III at `d=3`; the `d=3`
assembly). Sub-lettering (22a, 22b, …) keeps the integer phase numbers 23–26
stable; sub-letters name *one distinct chunk each* and are minted only when the
chunk's turn comes (Case III at `d=3` itself split: stratum 1 = 22c, the
D-candidate crux strata 2–3 = 22d; the `d=3` assembly later split the same way,
its design stratum = 22g and the corrected build = 22h).
**Structural-edit phase:** no new blueprint chapter; the producer nodes extend
`algebraic-induction.tex`, where they are already stubbed red. The KT math is
worked out in `notes/Phase21b.md` *Finding A/B* — the sub-phases formalize it.

#### Phase 22a — Case I realization (KT §6.2) — ✓ Complete (green-modulo-22b)

**Status (✓ Complete, green-modulo-22b; see `notes/Phase22a.md`).** Track A only:
the full-rank Case I realization producer. The composer
`PanelHingeFramework.case_I_realization` (`lem:case-I-realization`) discharges
`theorem_55`'s Case-I branch **green-modulo a single dischargeable hypothesis = KT
Claim 6.4** (the new red blueprint node `lem:claim-6-4`, deferred to Phase 22b) —
the same green-modulo pattern as Phase 21 → 21b. It is delivered via the
**block-triangular reframe**: KT eq. (6.3)'s rank-addition over one common
framework `ofNormals G ends q₀`, routed through the genericity device's
independent-row count (the H-block edges ⊔ the surviving edges made independent by
the exterior-column projection), not a common-seed splice. The one deferred
obligation is Claim 6.4 itself (the surviving block's exterior-projected rank at
the generic placement, KT eqs. (6.5)/(6.9)). The phase's cross-cutting lesson — a
formalization must reproduce the source's argument **structure**, not just its
conclusion — surfaced from the hpinc→asymmetric→block-triangular→Qc-non-root design
arc and is promoted to `DESIGN.md` *Match the source's argument structure, not just
its conclusion*. The full Case-I brick inventory (N4 contraction-minimality bridge,
the N5 splice/seed/rank-polynomial bricks, N6a/N6b/N6c, the two-motive split, the
generic-motive induction G2a–c / G3a–c), the decision history, and the hand-off
(next is the coordinator's Close C — open 22b — and the 22b discharge of Claim 6.4)
live in `notes/Phase22a.md`; dep-graph `algebraic-induction.tex`
`sec:molecular-algebraic-induction`.

#### Phase 22b — KT Claim 6.4 (Case-I green-modulo discharge, KT §6.2/§5.1) — ✓ Complete

**Status (✓ Complete; opened + closed 2026-06-05; see `notes/Phase22b.md`).** Scope:
*just* KT Claim 6.4 — the single dischargeable hypothesis Phase 22a left green-modulo
(22a's composer `case_I_realization` carried it as `hclaim64`, tracked by the red node
`lem:claim-6-4`; target the `Qc`-non-root / exterior-projected-rank form — the surviving
block of `G ＼ E(H)`, projected to `V(G)∖V(H)` via `(extProj V(H)).dualMap`, attains
independent rank `≥ D(|sc|−1)` at a generic locus; KT eqs. (6.5)/(6.9), §5.1).
Discharged via the recon's node cut — **N-22b-2** (the bounded `D∘panelRow`
rank-polynomial variant of `exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn_linking_set`) →
**N-22b-1** (the research-shaped rank-transport across the collapse map via algebraic
independence) → **N-22b-3** (the wire-up) — flipping `lem:claim-6-4` green and
`lem:case-I-realization` to fully green (same green-modulo → discharge pattern as
Phase 21 → 21b). The recon also renumbered the parked Case-III/assembly territory
`22b+` → `22c+`. Full record: `notes/Phase22b.md`; design doc §1.13–§1.16.

#### Phase 22c — Case III at `d=3`, stratum 1 (KT §6.4.1, Lemma 6.10, the eq. (6.12) `+(D−1)` placement) — ✓ Stratum-1 complete

**Status (✓ Stratum-1 complete; opened 2026-06-05 design-pass-first, stratum-1
producer landed 2026-06-05, crux split out to 22d; see `notes/Phase22c.md`).**
Track B at `d=3`, the conjecture's crux — KT §6.4.1, Lemma 6.10, the single
largest proof in KT (~12 pages). This is `theorem_55.hsplit` at `k=0`: a
`2`-edge-connected minimal `0`-dof-graph with no proper rigid subgraph and a
reducible degree-2 vertex `v`, target full rank `D(|V|−1)` (`D = 6` at `d=3`).
**Case III at `d=3` is multi-phase**; 22c claimed only **stratum 1** — the
eq. (6.12) degenerate placement (`p₁(vb)=q(ab)`, the `vb`-row reproducing the
`e₀=ab` row) giving a block-triangular `R(G,p₁)` with `R(G_v^{ab},q)` a
submatrix, hence `rank ≥ D(|V|−1)−1`, **one row short** — green + axiom-clean as
`PanelHingeFramework.case_II_placement_eq612`. The missing `+1` row (Lemma
6.10's `D`-candidate-frameworks argument: Claims 6.11/6.12) is **Phase 22d**.
Target nodes `lem:case-II-realization` (KT's Case III), `lem:case-III` **stay
red** — 22c lands the `+(D−1)` brick toward them.

**Opened on a layer-level design recon, not a build.** Case I (Track A) burned
~10 incremental node-by-node commits before a one-commit layer design pass
surfaced the binding gap (a too-weak shared motive); Case III is more
research-shaped and interlocking, so per `DESIGN.md` *Scale-up: design the LAYER,
not just the node* the phase opened with a docs-only design recon (five passes)
**before** cutting any Lean node. Full per-pass record + the stratum-1 brick
inventory: `notes/Phase22c.md`; design doc §1.25–§1.29.

#### Phase 22d — KT Claim 6.11 (the redundant `ab`-row) + its green-machinery prerequisites — ✓ Complete

**Status (✓ Complete; opened 2026-06-05 design-pass-first, closed at the Claim 6.11
milestone; see `notes/Phase22d.md`).** Opened to attack the conjecture's hardest
single argument — the *missing `+1` row* that lifts 22c's stratum-1 `D(|V|−1)−1`
brick toward full `D(|V|−1)` — and delivered, all green + axiom-clean, the prerequisite
machinery and the milestone claim itself: KT **Claim 6.11 / eq. (6.23)**
(`lem:case-III-claim-6-11`, the redundant `ab`-row of `R(G_v^{ab},q)`). The supporting
chain it discharges, bottom-up: the matroid-base form of KT Lemma 4.3(ii) at `k=0`
(`lem:case-III-claim-6-11-base`), the nested-IH shell `G−v` minimal `k'`-dof with
`k' ≤ D−2` (`lem:case-III-gap3-minimalKDof`), the analytic seed-rank kernel — rigidity
transfers to every algebraically-independent-over-ℚ seed (`lem:case-III-seed-rank-bridge`),
its `def>0` rank upper bound (`lem:case-III-seed-rank-upper`) and the exact-rank packaging
(`lem:case-III-rank-attainment`) — the full `hub` codimension bound `D+def ≤ dim Z`
(discharged on both consumers, carried by `lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound`), and the
redundant-row pigeonhole + row-set identity feeding the eq.-(6.18)/(6.22)⟹(6.23) discharge
(`lem:case-III-claim-6-11-redundant-row` → `lem:case-III-claim-6-11`). The kernel forced
the project's first algebraic-independence use (KT footnote 6 needs "*this* seed attains
the rank", not "*∃* a seed"); the alg-independence usage/relaxation question is tracked in
`notes/AlgebraicIndependence.md`. The one-paragraph lemma map, the Gap-2→3→1 dependency
story, and the decision log are in `notes/Phase22d.md`; dep-graph
`algebraic-induction.tex`'s `sec:molecular-algebraic-induction-caseIII`.

The successor work — the **candidate-completion** (eqs. (6.24)–(6.29)) converting that
redundant `ab`-row into the missing full-rank row, the **Claim 6.12** `D`-candidate
disjunction (de-risked, bottoms on the green Phase-17 Lemma 2.1), and the **`d=3`
assembly** (`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` `hub` brick + `thm:theorem-55` flip + wiring the
fully-green `case_I_realization`) — is the **deferred, unlettered** further cut, to open in
a successor sub-phase. Its *first* leaf (the eq. (6.28) column-support fact,
`dualMap_eq_comp_single_proj_of_vanish_off`) landed early under 22d's tail and is folded
into that successor's work. General-`d` (Lemma 6.13) → Thm 5.5 → Thm 5.6 → Conjecture 1.2
stays Phase 23. KT math: `notes/Phase22d.md`, `notes/Phase21b.md` *Finding A/B*,
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md` *Phase 22* / *Phase 23*.

#### Phase 22e — candidate-completion + KT Claim 6.12 (Case III at `d=3`), green-modulo-N3b — ✓ Complete

**Status (✓ complete, green-modulo-N3b, closed 2026-06-07; opened 2026-06-06
design-pass-first; see `notes/Phase22e.md`).** Successor to 22d, this completed the
`d=3` Case III algebra (KT §6.4.1, Lemma 6.10) green-modulo-N3b. It converted 22d's
redundant `ab`-row (KT eq. (6.23)) into the missing `+1` row via the eqs. (6.24)→(6.29)
row-op construction (`lem:case-III-candidate-row`) and discharged the resulting top-left
full-rank conditional with KT's **Claim 6.12** `D`-candidate disjunction
(`lem:case-III-claim612`, the contrapositive: the degree-2 eq. (6.44) forces all three
candidates to test the same `r ∈ ℝ⁶`, which a spanning extensor family — green Phase-17
Lemma 2.1 — forces to zero). The four affinely-independent points (N3a) took the
existence/Zariski route, not algebraic independence. The whole chain is green-modulo the
single point-join↔panel-meet duality leaf (`lem:case-III-claim612-line-in-panel-union`,
N3b), whose bounded `⋀²ℝ⁴` exterior-algebra assembly is **Phase 22f**. The two target
producer nodes `lem:case-II-realization` / `lem:case-III` stay red: their honest
discharge needs the deferred `d=3` realization assembly (instantiating the graph-free
candidate-completion at real graph data — `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` hub +
`thm:theorem-55` flip + Case-I wiring, the next unlettered cut after 22f), not N3b;
general-`d` (Lemma 6.13) stays Phase 23. Per-lemma plan, the N10 honest-scope
correction, and decisions in `notes/Phase22e.md`.

#### Phase 22f — N3b: point-join ↔ panel-meet duality assembly (KT §6.4.1) — ✓ Complete

**Status (✓ Complete, closed 2026-06-07; see `notes/Phase22f.md`).** Discharged Phase 22e's one
green-modulo-N3b leaf, `lem:case-III-claim612-line-in-panel-union` — the point-join ↔ panel-meet
duality at `d = 3` (`ScrewSpace 2 = ⋀²ℝ⁴`): the join `p̄ᵢ ∨ p̄ⱼ` of two points on a line
`L ⊂ Π(u)` and the panel-meet supporting extensor `C(L) = complementIso(n_u ∧ n')` of the same
line are scalar multiples (both the line's Plücker vector), so an `r` annihilating every `C(L)`
annihilates each spanning join (the Grassmann–Cayley duality KT use implicitly in eq. (6.45)). The
landed proof places both members in the 1-dim dual-annihilator line `Ω` (concrete at `⋀²ℝ⁴`, not
general Hodge theory) — `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` + the `r(C)=0 ⟹ r(join)=0` transfer
in `Molecular/Meet.lean`. N3b green took Claim 6.12 (N9) and the candidate-completion chain fully
green; the two producer nodes `lem:case-II-realization` / `lem:case-III` await only the `d=3`
realization assembly (Phase 22g). Forward-mode; dep-graph `algebraic-induction/case-iii.tex` +
`meet.tex`. Per-leaf detail + decisions: `notes/Phase22f.md`.

#### Phase 22g — the `d=3` realization assembly: design program + leaf infrastructure (KT §6.4.1) — ✓ Complete

**Status (✓ complete, closed 2026-06-09; see `notes/Phase22g.md`).** Closed as the design-program
+ leaf-infrastructure stratum of the `d=3` assembly (the 22c→22d precedent); the banner flips
(`lem:case-II-realization` / `lem:case-III`, the `theorem_55` `d=3` instance) moved to Phase 22h.
Delivered: the `d=3` Case-III crux architecture **pinned** — `case_III_claim612` restated to a
premise-free **existential** over the six point-joins (the three-fixed disjunction is
undischargeable, dim 3 < 6; the producer builds its candidate at the witness join's line); ~15
axiom-clean leaves (the existential restate, the join↔meet bridge + line-indexed candidate
placement, the homogeneous-vector Lemma 2.1 core + consumer restate, splitOff simplicity for
`|V| ≥ 4`, the graph-free producer pieces, and the bare→generic upgrade
`hasGenericFullRankRealization_of_rigidOn_ofNormals`); and the recon program (design §1.44–§1.49)
that surfaced + scoped the corrected remaining-work picture — GAPs 1–5: the `|V|=3` triangle base
(leaves T1–T4), the `M₃` third-panel dispatch (G4a–G4e, branch-interface verdict (β) = the
no-rigid branch receives the full conditioned IH), the bounded good-`t`, the landed bare→generic
upgrade, and the `IsProperRigidSubgraph` single-vertex predicate repair (G5) — all handed to 22h
with signatures in design §1.48–§1.49. Leaf ledger + decisions: `notes/Phase22g.md`.

#### Phase 22h — the corrected `d=3` assembly (KT §6.4.1, §5.2) — ✓ Complete

**Status (✓ complete, closed 2026-06-11; see `notes/Phase22h.md`).** Built the corrected
remaining-work picture Phase 22g's recon scoped (GAPs 1–5; signatures canonical in
`notes/Phase22-realization-design.md` §1.48–§1.55) and took the two producer nodes
`lem:case-II-realization` / `lem:case-III` green at `d = 3`, both pinned to
`PanelHingeFramework.case_III_realization`. Delivered: the predicate repair G5, the
full-conditioned-IH (β) restate, the `|V|=3` triangle floor (T1–T4), the (β)-shaped `hsplit`
producer with the full candidate-placement discharge (W1–W10b: the KT-Lemma-5.2 rank-transfer
assembly for the `M₁/M₂/M₃` arms off one redundancy), the `theorem_55_d3` instance with the
6.3-vs-6.5 dispatch and vacuity-discharged simple base, the `def = 0`/simple/spanning stratum of
the Thm 5.5→5.6 push (`rankHypothesis_deficiency_of_theorem_55_d3`), and the blueprint close
(`thm:theorem-55-d3-instance` green; `thm:theorem-55` stays red). **Closed green-modulo the named
carry family** {`h622` (KT eq.-(6.22) nested-IH rank bound, red node
`lem:case-III-nested-rank-lower`), `h65` (the Lemma-6.5 arm, red node `lem:case-I-dispatch`),
`hbase`/`hsplit`/`hcontract` (the bare-motive slots, red node `def:genuine-hinge-realization`)} —
user-adjudicated close shape (2026-06-10/11); all five discharged across the successor sub-phases
**22i** (the all-`k` genuine-hinge motive + reduction producers — `hbase`/`hcontract`) and **22k**
(Case III / `h622`, Lemma 6.5 / `h65`, spine / `hsplit`), with the **22j** placement abstraction
between, together delivering the KT-strength Thm 5.5 → 5.6 → Cor 5.7 at `d = 3` (Phases 24–26 unblocked).
Postmortem of the two surfaced divergences (the weak bare motive; the unformalized 6.3-vs-6.5
dispatch): `DESIGN.md` *Statement faithfulness to the source*. General `d` (KT Lemma 6.13) is
Phase 23.

#### Phase 22i — all-`k` genuine-hinge motive + reduction-case producers (KT §3, §5.2, §6.1–6.4) — ✓ Complete

**Status (✓ complete, closed 2026-06-14; see `notes/Phase22i.md`).** Opened as "the honest all-`k`
Theorem 5.5" — discharge the five 22h carries by restating the realization motive at KT's strength
and re-running the spine. Delivered **L0–L6**: the **genuine-hinge all-`k` motive** (the bare motive
on the free-hinge `BodyHingeFramework` carrier with an extensor-in-panel containment — KT's
coincident-panel Lemmas 5.3/6.2 are inexpressible with a derived hinge-as-meet — and the generic
motive on `PanelHingeFramework`; M1–M5 + bridges B1/B2; design `notes/Phase22-realization-design.md`
§1.56), the combinatorial bricks (`cutEdges`/2EC + the reduction-step lemmas), the **four-case
`|V|`-recursion** `minimal_kdof_reduction_all_k` (adding the not-2-edge-connected Lemma 6.1 and the
`k>0` splitting-off Lemma 6.8 the 0-dof reduction lacked), and the reduction-case producers — the
Lemma-5.3 base (`hbase` discharged), the cut-edge/Lemma-6.1 producer, the Case-I all-`k` producer
(Lemma 6.2 non-simple + Lemma 6.3 simple; `hcontract` discharged), and the Lemma-6.8 `k>0` split.
**Re-scoped at close by a deliberate split** (user-adjudicated; one work log active at a time): the
L6b producer inlined a ≈1010-line eq.-(6.12) placement because no shared brick fit the split-off, so
the remaining work split out — the shared **placement abstraction** + Case-II/split refactor is
**Phase 22j** (lands first; 22k consumes it), and the completion of the honest all-`k` Theorem 5.5
(Case III / `h622`, Lemma 6.5 / `h65`, the zero-carry spine / `hsplit`) + Theorem 5.6 at `d=3` is
**Phase 22k**. So the all-`k` Thm 5.5 → 5.6 deliverable spans 22i + 22k (with the 22j abstraction
between); general `d` is Phase 23. Carries table, layer plan (L0–L10), and the 22j recon verdict:
`notes/Phase22i.md` *Hand-off*.

## Engineering conventions

- **Namespace.** Everything sits inside `SimpleGraph` or
  `CombinatorialRigidity`. No top-level identifiers. **Exception
  (Phases 12–15):** the body-bar program adds `Matroid`-namespace defs
  (the ported submodular/union machinery, beside `Matroid.cycleMatroid`)
  and `Graph`-namespace defs (graph-level `kFrameMatroid` / sparsity, for
  dot-notation on `G : Graph α β`); framework defs stay under
  `CombinatorialRigidity`/`BodyBar`. See `notes/Phase12.md` and
  ROADMAP §15.
- **Vertex types.** Use `V : Type*` and `[Finite V]` (the weakest
  reasonable typeclass) in signatures whenever the *statement* works
  at that strength — this is the strongest mathematical claim, the
  one that applies most generally. When a proof body needs
  `Fintype V`-strength data (e.g. `Finset.univ`, `Fintype.card V`),
  bridge inline with `haveI : Fintype V := Fintype.ofFinite V`; for
  `Finset V` operations needing `DecidableEq V`, follow with
  `classical`. This is the mathlib idiom (enforced by the
  `unusedFintypeInType` env linter). Use `[Fintype V]` in the
  signature only when the *type* itself mentions `Fintype.card V`,
  `Finset.univ : Finset V`, or similar `Fintype`-flavored objects.
  Edge counts use `Set.ncard` so we don't force decidability of edge
  predicates. See `DESIGN.md` *Typeclass shape for finiteness on `V`*
  for the rationale (Phase 7 cleanup round resolution; two earlier
  iterations were considered and reversed). Algorithm-bearing files
  (`Search/DFS.lean`, `PebbleGame/`) deliberately depart from this
  rule and take `[Fintype V] [DecidableEq V]` end-to-end as a
  localized style island — the state machines iterate over
  `Finset V` / `Finset (V × V)` directly, and `#eval` / `decide`
  must fire on extracted certificates. See `DESIGN.md`
  *Pebble-game style island: `[Fintype V] [DecidableEq V]`* for the
  rationale + the math-layer / exec-layer (`-With`) split that keeps
  the island from contaminating the rest of the project's API.
- **Cardinalities.** Use `Set.ncard` for sets and `Finset.card` for finsets.
  Avoid `ℕ`-subtraction; rephrase `a ≤ b − c` as `a + c ≤ b`.
- **Style.** Module docstrings at the top of each file (`/-! # Title -/`).
  One declaration ↔ one purpose. Comments only when *why* is non-obvious.
- **Imports.** Each file imports the minimum it needs. `Sparsity.lean`
  should import only `SimpleGraph.Basic` + `Set.Card` + minor friends.
- **Decidability.** Add `[DecidableEq V]` / `[DecidableRel G.Adj]` only
  when a body genuinely builds specific `Finset V` / `Adj`-iterating
  objects. `classical` at the proof top is the acceptable alternative
  when adding the typeclass to the signature isn't worth the API
  noise. Many definitions can stay noncomputable via `Set.ncard`.
- **Predicates are `def`s, not `abbrev`s.** `IsSparse`, `IsTight`,
  `IsLaman`, and `edgesIn` are non-reducible. `grind` will not unfold
  them on its own. To break an `IsTight`/`IsLaman` goal into parts use
  `refine ⟨?_, ?_⟩`; for an `edgesIn` membership use the corresponding
  `mem_*` simp lemma. See `TACTICS-GOLF.md` § 4 for the full discussion.
- **Missing mathlib lemmas.** If you need a lemma that genuinely
  belongs upstream, put it under `Mathlib/<exact mathlib path>` so
  promotion is later a copy-paste. The directory is created lazily;
  don't pre-populate. See `DESIGN.md` "Mirror directory".
- **Tactic notes.** Practical guidance on `grind` (preferred closing
  tactic in this directory), the `Set.ncard` autoparam pattern, the
  mirror-first rule, and other cross-cutting idioms all live in
  `TACTICS-GOLF.md`. When in doubt, read it — the section TL;DRs are
  short and save iteration time.
- **No prose counts in shared docs.** Don't write "Phase X surfaced
  N upstream candidates" or similar in `ROADMAP.md`, `DESIGN.md`, or
  `TACTICS-GOLF.md` — counts drift the moment a new phase mirrors more
  lemmas. Link to `notes/FRICTION.md` "Mirrored" (or the mirror
  directory listing) as the source of truth instead.

## Working on the project

The per-session workflow (starting / working / friction review at
