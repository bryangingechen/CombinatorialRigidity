title: Combinatorial Rigidity
---

A Lean 4 / mathlib4 formalization of combinatorial rigidity theory,
working toward [**Laman's theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laman_graph) (1970):

> For $n \ge 2$, a graph is generically rigid in the plane if and only if
> it contains a spanning subgraph with $2n - 3$ edges in which every
> subgraph on $k \ge 2$ vertices has at most $2k - 3$ edges.

## Project status

Phases 1–9 are complete and carry no `sorry`s. The main theorem
[`SimpleGraph.isGenericallyRigid_two_iff_exists_isLaman_le`](https://github.com/bryangingechen/CombinatorialRigidity/blob/master/CombinatorialRigidity/LamanTheorem.lean)
in `LamanTheorem.lean` is fully formalized in both directions; the
Lovász–Yemini matroid identification has landed in both combinatorial
form (Phase 7) and linear-matroid form via `Matroid.ofFun` (Phase 8,
`linearRigidityMatroid_eq_rigidityMatroid`). Phase 9 ships the basic
`(k, ℓ)`-pebble game of Lee–Streinu 2008 in the matroidal regime
`ℓ < 2k` with certificate-form correctness theorem
`runPebbleGame_correct` and the matroidal-independence corollary
`countMatroid_indep_iff_runPebbleGame`, on top of a verified-DFS
warmup under `CombinatorialRigidity/Search/`.

The development is divided into the phases below, each in its own
file under
[`CombinatorialRigidity/`](https://github.com/bryangingechen/CombinatorialRigidity/tree/master/CombinatorialRigidity).
