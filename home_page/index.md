A Lean 4 / mathlib4 formalization of combinatorial rigidity theory,
working toward [**Laman's theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laman_graph) (1970):

> For $n \ge 2$, a graph is generically rigid in the plane if and only if
> it contains a spanning subgraph with $2n - 3$ edges in which every
> subgraph on $k \ge 2$ vertices has at most $2k - 3$ edges.

## Project status

The development proceeds in four arcs (the full plan is in
[`ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/bryangingechen/CombinatorialRigidity/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)):

- **Laman's theorem** (phases 1–6) — both directions, via the Henneberg route.
- **Rigidity matroid & sparsity decision** (phases 7–11) — the planar
  rigidity matroid as a mathlib `Matroid`, and an executable,
  certificate-carrying `(k, ℓ)`-pebble game (`Decidable` instances plus a
  `lake exe pebble-game` CLI).
- **Body-bar & body-hinge rigidity** (phases 12–16) — local matroid-union
  machinery (ported from `apnelson1/Matroid`), Tay's body-bar theorem
  (Tay 1984 / Whiteley 1988), and its body-hinge / panel-hinge
  Tay–Whiteley extension.
- **The molecular conjecture** (phases 17–26) — Katoh–Tanigawa 2011's
  proof of the panel-hinge Tay–Whiteley conjecture, the project's largest
  single undertaking and current frontier.

Phases 1–16 are complete and carry no `sorry`s: the main theorem
[`SimpleGraph.isGenericallyRigid_two_iff_exists_isLaman_le`](https://github.com/bryangingechen/CombinatorialRigidity/blob/master/CombinatorialRigidity/LamanTheorem.lean)
is formalized in both directions, and the development is fully green
through the body-hinge Tay–Whiteley theorem. Within the
molecular-conjecture program, the Grassmann–Cayley extensor algebra
(Lemma 2.1), the panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)`, the deficiency
matroid `M(G̃)`, the combinatorial induction (Theorem 4.9), and the
algebraic induction realizing that reduction at the rigidity-matrix rank
(phases 17–23) are built. At full Katoh–Tanigawa strength (all degrees of
freedom, genuine hinges), **Theorem 5.5** (the realization theorem, all
three cases including the hardest, Case III: `k=0`, no proper rigid
subgraph) and **Theorem 5.6** (every simple spanning multigraph realizes
the deficiency rank, reconciling the rigidity-matrix rank with the
combinatorial deficiency) are formalized at every dimension `d ≥ 3`, and
the **molecular conjecture itself** — Katoh–Tanigawa's Conjecture 1.2, for
simple graphs: such a graph can be realized as an infinitesimally rigid
body-hinge framework iff it can be realized as an infinitesimally rigid
panel-hinge framework — is now a theorem in the development
(`PanelHingeFramework.molecular_conjecture`). Within the molecule
application (phases 24–26), the generic bar-joint rigidity matroid — the
rank function the protein-flexibility formula reads in dimension three —
is packaged in linear-matroid form (phase 24); the current frontier is
projective invariance (phase 25) and the rank formula for the square
graph `G²` (phase 26).
The table below and `ROADMAP.md` carry the fine-grained, live status.
