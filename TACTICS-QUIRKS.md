# Tactics — rescue / build-failure recovery

This file is the project's **rescue reference**: when a `lake build`
fails with an unfamiliar Lean error, look here before iterating. Each
section is indexed by symptom (the error message or proof shape
you'd see), with the fix and a worked case study.

For **golfing / improvement** patterns (turning a verbose proof into
an idiomatic one), see `TACTICS-GOLF.md` instead — read at cleanup
time, not first-draft.

> The **Symptom index** just below is the first place to skim when a
> build fails — scan the symptom, jump to the named §.
> `CombinatorialRigidity/CLAUDE.md` points here.

> **Friction vs. idiom.** Cross-cutting rules — "if you see pattern
> X, prefer Y" — live here. One-shot frictions (a specific lemma we
> needed and mirrored) live in `notes/FRICTION.md`.

## Symptom index (scan this first on a build failure)

When a `lake build` fails with an unfamiliar Lean error, scan these symptoms
and jump to the named § below for the fix (the § titles are listed under
*Sections*). **No match here, or the same issue bites a second time in one
session? Grep `notes/FRICTION.md` (and `FRICTION-archive.md`)** for a keyword
from the error or the API you're fighting before brute-forcing another
attempt — FRICTION is written at friction-review time precisely so a repeat
encounter doesn't re-pay the discovery cost, and many entries carry the exact
failing pattern and the working fix.

- *"motive is not type correct"* after `simp only` citing a hypothesis not in the goal → § 5
- *"Unknown identifier X"* after `rcases ⟨rfl, rfl⟩` / `subst` between two free vars → § 4
- `interval_cases (Fintype.card V)` won't close by `rfl` → § 7
- `omega`/`grind` fails despite bridging hypotheses → `set`-aliased terms (§ 1) or commutativity/distributivity needing pre-normalization (§ 2) or two `{d}`-vs-numeral elaborations of one term mis-atomized (§ 58)
- `nlinarith` fails on `4*d+2 ≤ (d+1)*(d+2)`-style ℕ-quadratic → § 3

- `And.foo` / `Henneberg.IsLaman.foo not found` via dot notation → § 8; *"the environment does not contain `Function.foo`"* on `hc.foo …` (a `def`-headed hypothesis) usually means `foo` is declared *later in the same file* → § 8; the same *"`Function.symm`"* message on a `simp`-destructured `Ne`/`Not` hypothesis (e.g. after `simp only [not_or]`) → § 8 (apply `Ne.symm h` by name instead of `h.symm`); the same shape on an explicitly type-ascribed `(h : T).foo` (e.g. `Eq.foo not found`) → § 8 (call by fully-qualified name, pass `h` positionally instead of via dot notation)
- *"Application type mismatch"* on `congr_fun h` over `EuclideanSpace` → § 9; over `LinearMap`/`Module.Dual`/bundled morphisms → § 12
- `(deterministic) timeout at whnf` / *"Invalid `⟨...⟩`"* after `unfold`/`change` of a `Finset.univ.filter`-of-`Finset V` over `[Finite V]` → § 14
- `simp_all` confusing residual with a hypothesis you expected gone → § 10
- `linearIndependent_fin2` rewrite leaves `![v₀, v₁] 0` blocking a match → § 11
- `set V₊` / `let V₊` (subscript `₊ ₋ ₌`) → *"expected token"* → § 13
- *"typeclass … stuck: Semiring/Monoid/Module ?m"* on a `let`/`set` of a `Polynomial` with bare `X`/`0`/`1` → § 15
- *"MVar does not look like a recursive call"* / *"Unknown identifier `visited`"* / unused-`if h:` / *"failed to synthesize Fintype ι"* around `termination_by`/`decreasing_by` (`Finset.univ` measure) → § 16
- *"Application type mismatch: heq has type X = some ⟨…⟩"* in a `some` branch of `match heq : … with` → § 17
- *"rewrite … motive is not type correct"* on `rw [h]`, `h : D.field = …`, where a local's *type* references `D.field` → § 18
- *"Application type mismatch"* / *"Did not find … pattern"* in a `case` after `induction … using funName.induct` on a function with `let` in its body → § 19
- *"rewrite … motive is not type correct"* on `rw [eq]` after `obtain ⟨rfl, _⟩` on a cons-pattern endpoint, with a sibling walk holding that endpoint in its type → § 20
- `ring` *"unsolved goals"* on `Σ + B = B + Σ'` with alpha-renamed `Finset.sum`s → § 21
- *"failed to synthesize Decidable (a ≤ b)"* / *"DecidableRel"* / `fast_instance%` defeq, on a `LinearOrder.lift'` over a `SetLike` type → § 22
- *"Invalid `meta` definition … consider `public meta import`"* on `#eval (decide P)` from a sibling `module` file → § 23
- *"Type mismatch … `A ↔ ?` vs `A' ↔ …`"* on `refine h.trans ?_` / `Iff.trans` with `A'` only defeq to `A` → § 25
- *"motive is not type correct"* / *"Did not find … `(?G ↾ ?E₀).IsLink`"* after `rw [deleteEdges]` (or any `.copy`-defined `Graph` op) → § 27
- *"Did not find … pattern"* on `rw [if_pos rfl]` over a `(fun i ↦ if i = j then …) j` goal → § 28
- *"unknown constant `WList.deleteEdges_isWalk_iff`"* / `simp` no-progress on `WList.IsClosed` / `rw [cons_edge]` on `.edgeSet`, lifting a graph cycle by edge-substitution → § 29
- *"typeclass … stuck `(i : α) → Module ?m (?φ i)`"* on `def f : (α → W) →ₗ[ℝ] W := proj u - proj v` → § 30
- *"typeclass … stuck `HSMul ?m W W`"* at `t • x` under an unascribed `∀ t, …` binder → § 31
- *"Application type mismatch: x has type `Fin k → …`"* / *"numerals are data"* after `ext x` on a `Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)` equation → § 32
- *"rewrite … motive is not type correct"* on `rw [hsub]` (a `Submodule` eq) under `finrank ℝ ↥(…)` → § 33
- *"Did not find … `?g (∑ …)`"* / *"AddMonoidHomClass (M ≃ₗ …)"* on `rw [map_sum]` over a `Basis.repr (∑ …) t` coordinate → § 34
- *"Invalid field `foo`"* on `g.foo` where `Graph.foo` resolves by name but not by projection (file-local re-namespace) → § 35
- *"… does not contain field `Exists.foo`"* on `h.foo`, where `h`'s *type* is a `def : Prop` unfolding to `∃ …` (a motive like `HasGenericFullRankRealization`) → § 35 (variant — call the pkg lemma by qualified name, `∃`-hyp positional)
- *"… does not contain field `Eq.foo`"* on `hf.foo`, where `hf`'s type is a `def : Prop` wrapping *another* `def : Prop` that unfolds to a bare `Eq` (e.g. `IsTightPartition`/`IsSquareTightPartition`) → § 35 (variant — re-ascribe the wrapper type via a `have` before dot-calling)
- *"motive is not type correct"* / *"`Subsingleton ?m` stuck"* matching an `ιMulti_family`/index at a derived cardinality (`m+n`, `disjUnion`) against a literal one → § 36
- *"Did not find … `Nonempty (Function.Embedding.{?u+1,?u+1} …)`"* on `rw [← Cardinal.le_def]` when `α`/`β` are in different universes → § 37
- `(deterministic) timeout at whnf`/`isDefEq` unfolding a basis/dual-coordinate iso `φ` *in place* over a heavy `Module.Dual …`/exterior-power type → § 38 (extract a generic helper); also when a lemma application leaves a *heavy-carrier implicit* (arg / row-family / seed-function `qρ` / panel-endpoint `a b` of a relabel brick) to be inferred against a heavy `ofNormals …` goal → § 38 (pin it explicit)
- `(deterministic) timeout at whnf` in a *pre-existing, untouched* exterior-algebra proof right after adding an `InnerProductSpace`/`EuclideanSpace` import → § 59 (the metric `PiLp` instances poison `⋀`-elaboration; keep the bridge in a mirror / a downstream file)
- *"failed to synthesize `Module.IsTorsionFree`/`NoZeroSMulDivisors`"* on `LinearIndependent.of_subsingleton` (or any "obvious" algebraic instance a full-mathlib scratch finds) in a narrow-import / mirror file → § 40 (add the instance's defining import)
- `rw [eq]` rewriting a *function*-valued term (`rw [← f.sum_repr y]`) over-rewrites the *other* side of the goal (hits `y`'s partial applications `y i`) → § 41 (`conv_lhs`/`nth_rewrite`)
- `exact helper h` fails / times out because `h` at the call site and `h` in the helper's conclusion are two separate `by tac` elaborations (proof-term mismatch) → § 42 (use `let`-bound params in the statement)
- *"rewrite … Did not find an occurrence of the pattern"* on `rw [h]` whose LHS was `e`, after a `set X := e` ran between obtaining `h` and the `rw` (the `set` folded `e → X` in `h` too) → § 43; also *"Application type mismatch: hyp has type … re✝³ but is expected … re"* (or a whnf-heartbeat timeout) when `set` folds a *carried hypothesis*'s heavy type before an `exact` of a lemma whose expected type is built from the `set` vars → § 43 (don't `set` the type-bearing atoms; pass literals)
- `rw [map_neg]` fails *"Did not find … `?f (-?a)`"* on `(-f) x` (negation on the *map*, not the argument) → § 44 (use `LinearMap.neg_apply`)
- `ring` *"unsolved goals"* after `push_cast` on a statement containing `↑(n - 1 : ℕ)` (ℕ-subtraction coerced to `ℤ`) — write `(↑n - 1 : ℤ)` in the statement instead → § 47
- *"expected token"* on a `set`/`obtain`/`have` of an identifier like `ρ̂` (base char + a *combining* U+0302, not the precomposed glyph) → § 45 (rename to ASCII-decorated `ρ0`)
- *"expected token"* at the `⧸` glyph of `M ⧸ P` even though `Submodule.mkQ`/`Quotient.mk_eq_zero` resolve by name → § 60 (the quotient *notation* needs a direct `import Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Quotient.Basic`; or drop the ascription and let `set π := P.mkQ` infer the codomain)
- *"rewrite … motive is not type correct"* on `rw [hidx]`, `hidx : k = k'`, rewriting the **index** of a `l[k]` / `l[k]'h` `getElem` (the bounds proof `h : k < l.length` depends on `k`) → § 61 (re-apply your indexing lemma at `k'` instead of rewriting the index in place; the `List.ofFn _ = x :: …` head-peel sibling — `rw [show …, List.ofFn_succ]` — is the §61 *variant*, use `List.ext_getElem`)
- `simp only [Matrix.cons_val_zero]` reports the arg *unused* / no progress on `![…] ⟨0, ⋯⟩` after `fin_cases` (a `Fin.mk`, not the literal) → § 46 (add `show (⟨0,_⟩ : Fin n) = 0 from rfl` first, per branch)
- *"unexpected token '-'"* at the *second* minus of a chained `x - a - b` (single subtraction fine) in a Graph-package file → § 48 (the scoped `G - S` deleteVerts notation poisons `-` chains; parenthesize `(x - a) - b`); the *same* poisoning also hits `x - a + b` as `"overloaded, errors" / "Unknown identifier" / "unexpected token ':='; expected command"` several lines later — any operator after `-` needing a ≥100-precedence left operand triggers it, not just a second `-`
- `Pi.single w y u` type-inference failure, or `▸` in a `fun h => …` lambda for `Pi.single_eq_of_ne` can't infer `h`'s type → § 49 (annotate: `(Pi.single w y : α → T) u`; `show u ≠ w from fun (h : u = w) => …`)
- *"unknown identifier `Function.update_same`"* → § 50 (renamed to `Function.update_self` in current mathlib)
- `Submodule.subtype_injective` elaborates as the identity in some call sites → § 50 (use `Subtype.coe_injective` directly)
- *"unexpected token 'set_option'; expected 'lemma'"* when placing `set_option … in` between a docstring and `theorem` → § 51 (put `set_option … in` *before* the docstring)
- *"unexpected identifier; expected 'lemma'"* pointing *inside* a `/-- … -/` docstring's prose (not at the decl) → § 57 (a `-/` inside a word, e.g. `grade-/ambient`, closes the doc comment early; reword to avoid the `-/` adjacency)
- `set_option linter.style.openClassical false in open Classical` breaks section-wide `Classical` availability → § 52 (use two standalone commands, not `in`-wrapped)
- `set F := expr`; theorem applied to `F` returns `F.graph` (or another field) unfolded — downstream `rw [hField]` fails → § 53 (introduce `hFgraph : F.graph = G` explicitly, `rw [hFgraph] at …` first)
- *"Application type mismatch: … has type `S.addCommMonoid` but expected `AddCommGroup.toAddCommMonoid`"* on `domRestrict`/`quotKerEquivRange`/`finrank_quotient_add_finrank` for `S : Submodule`, even after `haveI : AddCommGroup ↥S` → § 54 (`letI`, not `haveI`, to shadow the global `Submodule.addCommMonoid`)
- `linter.style.longLine` flags far more / fewer lines than `awk 'length>100'` reports on a UTF-8-heavy file → § 55 (the linter counts Unicode codepoints, not bytes; count with Python `len(s)`)
- downstream `import M` + `namespace Foo` + `open scoped Graph` → `V(G)` *"unexpected token ')'; expected ','"* AND `binop%` flips bare-ℕ `n-1`→ℤ-sub (`exact_mod_cast` fails); `open Foo` is fine → § 56 (a bare `Graph.`-prefixed decl inside `namespace Foo` in `M` made a `Foo.Graph` sub-namespace that captures `open scoped Graph`; pin the decl to `_root_.Graph.`)
- *"unexpected token '+'; expected ')'"* on `f ((x : ℕ) - 1 + 2)` / `⟨(x : ℕ) - 1 + 1, h⟩` (a type-ascription left operand then `+`/`-`), goal display silently drops the trailing `+ k` → § 62 (re-parenthesize the whole arithmetic: `(((x : ℕ) - 1) + 2)`)
- `omega` fails on a goal over `↑(⟨(i : ℕ), h⟩ : Fin m)` with `hid : (i : ℕ) < …` in scope, the counterexample naming a `↑↑i` atom that *satisfies* the goal → § 63 (omega atomizes `Fin.val (Fin.mk …)` distinctly from `(i : ℕ)`; force the defeq with `show … from hid`, not `simp only [Fin.val_mk]` which the linter flags unused)
- *"failed to synthesize Fintype (n₁ ⊕ n₂)"* (or any constructed column type) reported at the **goal-statement** line `… : … ≤ (Matrix.fromBlocks …).rank`, despite an in-proof `haveI : Fintype … := Fintype.ofFinite …` → § 64 (`Matrix.rank`/`mulVec` carries `[Fintype <cols>]`; when the *goal* exposes `.rank` on a built type, put `[Fintype]` on the summands in the signature — the in-proof instance is too late)
- *"rewrite … Did not find … `Disjoint ?m ?m`"* on `rw [Set.disjoint_left]` against a `Set.PairwiseDisjoint`/`Pairwise (Disjoint on f)` goal → § 71 (unfolds to `Function.onFun Disjoint f a b`; supply the proof as a term, `Set.disjoint_left.mpr (…)`, instead of rewriting)
- `zify`/`push_cast` on a hypothesis containing `↑(∑ᶠ u ∈ s, f u)` casts only the *outer* `finsum`, leaving `∑ᶠ x, ↑(∑ᶠ (_ : x ∈ s), f x)` instead of `∑ᶠ u ∈ s, ↑(f u)` — the two are defeq but not syntactically equal, so a later `rw`/`linarith` matching a manually-stated cast form fails → § 72 (convert the `finsum` to a `Finset.sum` — `finsum_mem_eq_finite_toFinset_sum` — *before* casting; `Finset.sum`'s cast pushes through cleanly via `Nat.cast_sum`)
- *"environment already contains 'Ns.foo' from <other module>"* at `lake lint`/`runLinter` (the whole-project import-merge) on a decl `lake build <your module>` accepted → § 65 (a duplicate top-level name in a shared namespace; single-file build never imports the sibling, so name-check the namespace — `grep -rn "def <name>"` / `lean_local_search` — before naming, and run `lake lint` not just `lake build <module>` pre-commit)
- *"synthesized type class instance is not definitionally equal … synthesized `…instDecidableEqSigma…` / inferred `Classical.decEq …`"* on `rw [defName, …apiLemma]` unfolding a def that froze a `Classical.decEq` in its body → § 66 (`rw` matches instance args strictly; use `simp only [defName, …, apiLemma]`, lenient on instances, or `congr 1` then `rw`)
- `V(G)`/`E(G)`/`↾`/`G - S` *"unexpected token '('; expected ','"* (or `… expected '}'`) in a **def/theorem signature binder** (`∀ e ∈ E(G), …`, `{e // e ∈ E(G)}`) in a `Molecular/RigidityMatrix/` file, while `lean_multi_attempt` accepts the same syntax → § 67 (the scoped `Graph` notation is **not in scope** — these files sit in `namespace CombinatorialRigidity.Molecular` with **no** `open Graph`, unlike the `namespace Graph` files; write the dot form `G.edgeSet`/`G.vertexSet`, matching the file's existing `F.graph.IsLink` style — *not* the same as § 48/§ 56, which are notation *present* but poisoning)
- *"This simp argument is unused: `L`"* on `simp only [..., L, ...]`, but dropping `L` leaves the goal unsolved (the arg IS needed) → § 68 (a *missing sibling* lemma stalled `simp` before `L` could fire — two parallel sub-terms each need their own `Pi.single_eq_of_ne` instance; read the post-`simp` goal with `lean_goal`, *add* the sibling, don't remove `L` — distinct from § 46/§ 63 where a simproc/`dsimp` did the reduction)
- *"failed to synthesize `HMul (Matrix (E(G) × …) …) (Matrix (E((caseIIICandidate …).graph) × …) …)`"* when threading a LEFT factor `Lrow * M` into a cert, even though `(caseIIICandidate …).graph = G` by `rfl`; **then** *"type mismatch `IsUnit Lrow✝.det` vs `IsUnit Lrow.det`"* after `set F₀ := candidate` → § 69
- *"Type mismatch: `t` has type `ℕ` but expected `Fin m`"* on a `(t : Fin m)` cast (variable `m`, `[NeZero m]`), or `ring`/`push_cast`/`Fin.val_one'` failing to find `CommRing`/`NatCast (Fin m)` (while `abel` works) → § 70 (`CommRing`/`NatCast (Fin n)` are **scoped**, not global — `open Fin.NatCast Fin.CommRing in` before the doc comment; `le_or_lt`→`Nat.lt_or_ge`, `⨆ f : α→α` needs `Nonempty (α→α)`) (`*`/`HMul` matches the contracted index *syntactically*, not up to `rfl`: type `Lrow` at the candidate-graph edgeSet form `M` literally carries + an explicit `[Fintype {e // e ∈ (caseIIICandidate …).graph.edgeSet}]` binder; and do **not** `set F₀` — it rewrites the candidate inside `Lrow`'s type, splitting the `Fintype` instance from `hLrow`)
- *"rewrite … motive is not type correct"* on `rw [hscrew]` / `rw [hcard]` (numeral or `Nat.card V`
  equalities) with an *"Application type mismatch"* naming an unrelated `Graph V (Sym2 V ⊕ Fin (… -
  1) + 1))` type → § 77 (the same literal also occurs inside another subterm's dependent-type
  index in the goal; drop the `rw`s and hand the raw equalities straight to `omega`)
- *"failed to create binder due to failure when reverting variable dependencies"* on `fun i => h ▸ hyp i` where `h`'s equation mentions a `set`/`let`-bound local → § 73 (hoist the transport out of the binder: prove the `∀`-form once by `rw [h]; exact hyp` and pass the family whole)
- `decide` on a goal containing `Nat.card (Fin n)` fails at real `lake build` time (*"its `Decidable` instance … did not reduce to `isTrue` or `isFalse`"*), even if it appeared to succeed in an isolated MCP `lean_run_code` snippet → § 74 (`Nat.card` doesn't kernel-reduce through `Cardinal.mk`/`Classical.choice`; `simp only [Nat.card_fin]` first to turn every `Nat.card (Fin n)` into the literal `n`, then `decide`/`norm_num` closes the rest)
- *"Unknown constant `Ns.lemma.mp"`/`"…mpr"`* on a bare `Iff` lemma (no local hypothesis, no explicit application) → § 75 (the lemma's structure argument, e.g. `(G : SimpleGraph V)`, is bound *explicitly* in the enclosing `variable`; dot-projection on the bare name can't skip past it — dot-call on the argument instead, `G.lemma.mpr …`, or supply it named, `(lemma (G := G)).mpr …`)
- *"unexpected token 'omit'; expected 'lemma'"* → § 76 (`omit […] in` must sit *before* the declaration's doc comment, not after)
- *"Tactic `rcases` failed: `… : ∀ …, …` is not an inductive datatype"* on an `obtain ⟨…, _, …⟩` right after narrowing a producer's `∃`-conjunct count → § 78 (a stale sibling call site still destructures the *old*, wider tuple shape; grep every call site of the touched producer *name*, not just the ones already mid-edit)
- *"Not a definitional equality: `(foo …).field` … not defeq to `3`"* / `rfl` fails on a data-`def`'s record projection, or a `… ≤ n` slot rejects a proof of the reduced form → § 79 (the `def` body used `obtain`/`rcases`/`cases`, i.e. `casesOn` on an opaque scrutinee, which blocks the returned `{…}`'s projections; rebuild with `have`+`.1`/`.2` projections + `set`/`let` so the constructor stays at the head)
- `rw [Fintype.card_coe]` fails with *"Did not find an occurrence of the pattern `Fintype.card ↥?s`"* after unfolding a Finset-indexed clique/induced-subgraph fact (e.g. `isClique_iff_induce_eq`) → § 80 (the goal's vertex type is `↥(↑X : Set V)`, the *Set*-coercion's coe-sort, not `X`'s own Finset coe-sort `↥X` — `rfl`-equal via `Finset.coe_sort_coe` but not the same syntactic pattern `rw` searches for; close with `simp` instead)
- *"Application type mismatch"* on an `Or.inr`/anonymous-constructor argument whose type is a rigid `Eq` (e.g. `hfoo.symm`), expected against a `Set`-membership goal (`x ∈ ?m`) → § 81 (the target *set* is an implicit not pinned by any other argument, so the membership type isn't known yet; `rfl` in the same spot would work since it unifies with anything — pin the implicit explicitly, `(S := {...})`, at the call site)
- `rw [foo_iff_bar, baz_univ_iff]` fails ("did not find an occurrence") on the *second* application when proving an `Iff` whose two sides aren't shaped alike (one side is `Set.univ`-indexed, the other an arbitrary subset) → § 82 (a lemma keyed to a specific literal argument only fires where that literal occurs; apply it once, then `change` the goal to the other side's unfolded target instead of re-`rw`ing symmetrically)
- *"failed to synthesize instance `Fintype ↑(G.1 v)`"* when subsetting a `G.neighborSet v` (via `(G.neighborSet v).toFinset` / `Set.mem_toFinset` under a `haveI : Fintype (G.neighborSet v) := Fintype.ofFinite _`) → § 83 (`Set.mem_toFinset` re-keys the instance against `neighborSet`'s unfolded `↑(G.Adj v)` form, which the folded-keyed ad-hoc instance misses; go through `G.neighborFinset v` + `coe_neighborFinset`/`mem_neighborFinset` with `[Fintype V] [DecidableRel G.Adj]` instead)
- *"failed to synthesize instance `Fintype ↑(G.neighborSet v)`"* on a statement using `G.degree v` under `[Fintype V]` alone (no other instance) → § 84 (`[Fintype V]` alone never gives `Fintype (G.neighborSet v)` — that needs `[DecidableRel G.Adj]` too, or an explicit per-vertex `[Fintype (G.neighborSet v)]`; there is no automatic `Finite → Fintype` bridging instance in mathlib, `Fintype.ofFinite` is a `noncomputable def`, not a registered instance)
- *"Unknown identifier `ℝ`"* (*"cannot treat … as an implicitly bound variable … `autoImplicit` is `false`"*) in a downstream file that never imports the module supplying the notation, right after a leaf dependency drops that import during a field-generalization sweep → § 85 (the module system's `public import` re-exports transitively; the downstream file relied on the leaf's dropped import, not its own)
- *"failed to compile definition, consider marking it as `noncomputable` … depends on `Real.instField`"* on a plain `def` that used to compile fine, right after a dependency it calls was generalized from concrete `ℝ` to `[Field K]` → § 86 (instantiating the generic hypothesis at `K := ℝ` routes through `Field.toCommRing`/`Real.instField` instead of the direct, computable `Real.instCommRing` the ℝ-hardwired version used; mark the caller `noncomputable`)
- *"typeclass instance problem is stuck: `Field ?m…`"* (or an *"unknown identifier"*/kernel *"unknown constant"* cascade from a sibling decl) on a theorem whose statement is *itself* `Fin _ → K`-free — it only names a previously-generalized function by its non-`K` arguments (e.g. `Function.Injective (wedgePairing k hj)`) — right after that function's base ring was swept from concrete `ℝ` to `[Field K]` → § 87 (the theorem's own header never mentions `K` as a token, so Lean's section-variable auto-inclusion never brings it into scope for this decl at all; annotate the call `(K := K)` — or any other literal `K` token in the header — to force inclusion; in a *still-`ℝ`-hardwired downstream caller* of the newly-`K`-generic function the same stuck-`Field ?m` fires at `have`/`set`/`Function.Injective (f (k := k) …)` proof sites and the pin is `(K := ℝ)`)
- *"…is not definitionally equal to…"* on a `change`/`rw`/defeq whose two sides differ **only in a universe level** (`Module.finrank.{u, u}` vs `.{u, 0}`), over a carrier `def` just generalized from concrete `ℝ` to `[Field K]` → § 88 (a literal `: Type` result ascription that was right at `ℝ` — universe 0 — pins the carrier at `Type 0` while its body over abstract `K : Type u` is `Type u`; drop the `: Type` or make it `Type _`)
- *`two_ne_zero`/`(2 : K) ≠ 0` fails to synthesize, or `linarith failed to find a contradiction`* on a goal about **field scalars** (not ℕ/ℤ counts) after an ℝ→K sweep → § 89 (the *proof*, not the signature, silently used ℝ's characteristic-0 or ordered structure: a hard-coded nonzero numeral (`t = 2`, `two_ne_zero`) is a hidden char-≠-2 assumption — reroute a "pick a nonzero scalar avoiding a small bad set" argument through `[Infinite K]` + `Set.infinite_univ.diff hfin |>.nonempty`; and `linarith`/`nlinarith`/`positivity` on a field-scalar identity needs an ordered field — over general `K` use `linear_combination`/`ring`)
- `rw [neg_one_smul]` (no arguments) *"Did not find an occurrence of the pattern `-1 • ?x`"* even though the goal visibly is `(-1 : K) • x = -x` → § 90 (`neg_one_smul`'s ring argument is **explicit**, so a bare `rw` must synthesize its instances against unconstrained metavariables before any goal-matching happens, and the search comes back empty instead of deferring; supply the term fully — `exact neg_one_smul K x`, never `neg_one_smul K _` — or use the `module` tactic once the opaque functions on either side have already been related by their own congruence lemma)
- *"motive is not type correct"* naming a `Decidable _a` instance mismatch, on `rw [hiff]` where `hiff : P ↔ Q` and `P` sits inside an `ite`'s condition → § 91 (the `Decidable` argument is indexed by `P` itself; use `simp only [hiff]`, not `rw`)
- *"rewrite … motive is not type correct"* on `rw [heq]` whose LHS is a `set`-bound variable (`heq : x = …`, `x` from `set x := e`), in a numeric goal → § 98 (don't `rw` the `set` atom away; leave it and let `omega`/`linarith` consume `heq` as a hypothesis — `rw` only the ordinary non-`set` terms)
- A `have hm : m = someEquiv ⟨(a, b), hab⟩ := (Equiv.apply_symm_apply someEquiv m).symm` *type mismatch*, right after `obtain ⟨⟨a, b⟩, hab⟩ := someEquiv.symm m` destructured an expression not itself present in the goal → § 92 (`obtain`/`cases` on a bare expression loses zeta-transparency back to it; use `set a := (someEquiv.symm m).1.1 with ha_def` / `set b := …1.2` instead, then a bare `rfl` reconnects)
- *"Application type mismatch: The argument e has type ↑(…) but is expected to have type ↑E((F args).graph)"* on a row-family statement whose `e`'s `Subtype` domain is spelled via the base graph `G`, applied through a concrete framework-constructor `def F args := ⟨G, …⟩` → § 93 (`(F args).graph = G` by `rfl`, but a plain, non-`@[reducible]` `def` doesn't unfold at the transparency the application check uses; mark the constructor `@[reducible]` — and drop `@[simp]` from its `.graph` projection lemma, which becomes `simpVarHead` once reducible)
- *"Application type mismatch"* on a lemma call, with the expected type printed full of unassigned `?m.NNN` metavariables for an implicit argument you'd expect a later explicit argument to pin → § 94 (the implicit occurs, in an *earlier* explicit argument's type, only applied to a field projection — not as a bare metavariable — so elaboration can't invert it and gives up instead of deferring; pin the implicit by name, e.g. `foo (F := concreteF) D M h`)
- `ext m` on a `Module.Dual`/linear-map equality introduces *more* variables than expected (an extra anonymous `x✝`), leaving a goal built from `∘ₗ LinearMap.single …` that no whole-argument lemma matches → § 95 (the domain is a dependent function type, e.g. `Motion n α := α → EuclideanSpace …`, so `ext` reaches for a Pi-decomposition ext lemma instead of stopping at `LinearMap.ext`; use `refine LinearMap.ext fun m => ?_` instead of `ext m`)
- `Type mismatch: Fin.snoc (fun b ↦ ?m.34) ?m.45 (index) has type ?m.20 (index) but is expected to have type α`, from a `Fin.snoc f x` applied to a further index inside `Matrix.of` (or any nested elaboration context) even though `f`/`x` are both plainly non-dependent → § 96 (the dependent motive `α : Fin (n+1) → Sort*` doesn't get resolved to the constant type before the application is checked; ascribe the whole `Fin.snoc f x` term's type explicitly, `(Fin.snoc f x : Fin (n+1) → α) (index)`, before applying it)
- *"Application type mismatch"* on a multi-arg call `f X idx t1 t2`, naming the **last** written argument against an unrelated-looking expected type (not an arity complaint) → § 97 (`X = S.field` was written without parens around `S.field idx`, so all four tokens became separate arguments to `f`; parenthesize `f (S.field idx) t1 t2`)

    `DFunLike.coe_injective` or `LinearMap.ext_iff`.

    use alphanumeric suffix.
14. **`Finset.univ.filter` of `Finset V` under `[Finite V]` triggers
    cascading instance synthesis friction** — define on `Set V` first,
    bridge via `Set.Finite.toFinset`.
15. **Bare `Polynomial.X` (or `0`, `1`) needs explicit type ascription
    in `let`/`set` of a `Polynomial`-valued expression** — annotate
    the literal: `(Polynomial.X : Polynomial ℝ) • …`.
16. **`termination_by` / `decreasing_by` elaboration rescue** —
    explicit typeclass binding on the def, named def params over
    pattern-match binders, `_h`-prefixed `if h :` binders to silence
    the unused-variable lint, and `termination_by haveI :=
    Fintype.ofFinite ι; …` to keep a `Finset.univ`-based measure under
    a `[Finite ι]` signature.
17. **`match h : <expr> with | pat => …` substitutes `expr ↦ pat` in
    the *goal* of each branch** — return `rfl` when the goal collapses
    to `pat = pat`, or restructure to `by_contra` + `cases h_eq : …`.
18. **`rw [h]` over a structure field whose value appears in another
    local's type** — motive failure. Build the rewritten Finset
    equality via `Finset.ext`, then `rw` the equation as a unit.
19. **`induction … using funName.induct` on a function with `let` in
    its body** — name the `let`-bound case-binder; `dsimp only at h`
    after `rw [funName] at h` to inline the inner-let shadow; use
    `nomatch h` (not `Option.noConfusion`) to discharge
    match-with-`none`-discriminee contradictions.
20. **`rw [eq]` after `obtain ⟨rfl, _⟩` on a cons-pattern endpoint
    trips motive on the sibling walk's type** — bind both pair
    equalities to named hypotheses; `rw` on the *un*-substituted
    endpoint (which doesn't appear in the sibling walk's type).
21. **`ring` fails on alpha-renamed `Finset.sum`s — `omega` /
    `linarith` as atom extractor** — bind each sum identity as a
    named `have` and close the surrounding linear (in)equality with
    `omega` / `linarith`; both treat each `Finset.sum` as an opaque
    ℕ / ordered-field atom, sidestepping `ring`'s lambda-body
    syntactic-identity check.
22. **`LinearOrder.lift'` on a `SetLike` type silently fails to
    propagate `DecidableLE` (and `fast_instance%` reports a
    `PartialOrder` mismatch)** — the type already has a `PartialOrder`
    via the `SetLike.instPartialOrder` subset order, which occupies
    the slot. Wrap the type in `Lex` and register the linear order on
    that, or skip the instance entirely and sort the projection
    through `Lex (β)` for some image type `β` with `Prod.Lex`-style
    order already in mathlib.
23. **`#eval`-bearing `module` files need `public meta import`** for
    the imported `Decidable` / elaboration instances — keep the
    `public import X` and add a second-form `public meta import X`.
24. **Restating a subterm in a standalone `have` can fail to
    elaborate (`Function expected`) even when the same subterm in the
    goal type-checks** — the goal's surrounding lemmas pin implicit
    motives (e.g. `Pi.single`'s family type); operate on the goal in
    place (`Finset.sum_congr` / `simp only`) rather than restating it.
25. **`refine h.trans ?_` (or `Iff.trans`) needs the bridging iff's
    side to *syntactically* match the goal — defeq is not enough** —
    when a helper iff's LHS is only definitionally equal to the goal's
    LHS (`F.IsIndependent` vs `F.toBodyBar.IsIndependent`, `∃ (_ : p)`
    vs `p ∧ q`), `.trans` fails with a type mismatch. Drop `.trans`
    and bridge with `constructor` + `.mp` / `.mpr` instead, which let
    each direction close up to defeq via `exact`.
26. **`simp [← lemma]` stalls on a `Submodule`/subtype carrier over a
    `RingQuot`-built algebra** (e.g. an `ExteriorAlgebra` graded piece)
    — the build prints *"definitions were not unfolded because their
    definition is not exposed: `RingQuot.instSub`"* (or `instSMul`,
    `instAdd`, …). The subtype's `Sub`/`SMul`/`Add` come through the
    `RingQuot` quotient and stay sealed by the module system, so a
    `simp [← smul_sub]`-style rewrite can't see the operation to fold.
    **Fix:** don't drive it through `simp`; build the membership and
    `rw` the `AddCommGroup`/`Module` identity onto the named hypothesis
    instead. Generic congruence-layer rewrites (`add_sub_add_comm`)
    still fire under `simp`, since they apply without unfolding the
    sealed op.
27. **`rw [deleteEdges]` (or any mathlib-`Graph` op built via `.copy`)
    trips the motive** — `rw` the `def` fails / over-substitutes; use
    its `@[simps!]` lemmas (`vertexSet_deleteEdges`, `deleteEdges_isLink`,
    `edgeSet_deleteEdges`) via `simp only` instead.
28. **`rw [if_pos rfl]` fails on a `(fun i ↦ if i = j then …) j` goal**
    (un-beta-reduced lambda hides the `ite`) — use `simp only [↓reduceIte]`,
    which beta-reduces and reduces the `if (j = j)` in one step.
    `simp only [if_pos rfl]` also works but flags `if_pos` as an unused
    simp arg, so prefer the simproc name.

## 1. `omega`/`grind` treat `set`-aliased terms as opaque atoms

When a proof opens `set name := expr with name_def` and later
receives a hypothesis mentioning `expr` literally (typically from a
downstream lemma call), the two views are defeq but `omega`/`grind`
see them as distinct atoms and won't bridge across.

**Fix:** one explicit `rw [← name_def] at h_expr_form` (or
`rw [name_def] at h_alias_form`) before invoking the tactic.

The `set` tactic's substitution scope is bounded by *current*
goals/hypotheses, not future tactic outputs — this is intrinsic, not
a bug. Same pattern bites `grind`.

Canonical case: `IsSparse.typeII_reverse_blocker` in `Sparsity.lean`.

---

## 2. `omega` doesn't carry commutativity or distributivity on atoms

If `omega` has `k * #s` on one side and `#s * k` on the other (or
`k * #(s ∪ t) + k * #(s ∩ t)` vs. `k * #s + k * #t`), it sees four
unrelated atoms and fails.

**Fix:** pre-normalize.

- For commutativity: `rw [mul_comm]` so the form omega sees matches
  the goal.
- For distributivity: stage a `have h_mul : … := by rw [← Nat.mul_add,
  ← Nat.mul_add, Finset.card_union_add_card_inter]` and hand the
  multiplied identity to omega alongside the unmultiplied facts.

One-liner alternative: `linear_combination k * h.symm`, but this
requires `Mathlib.Tactic.LinearCombination` (which `Sparsity.lean`
does not currently import).

Canonical cases: `IsGenericallyRigid.card_mul_le` in `Framework.lean`
(commutativity), `IsTightOn.union_inter` in `Sparsity.lean`
(distributivity).

**Three-way variant (ℕ-product, ℤ-cast, truncated subtraction).** The
molecular rank/deficiency counts pit `D·|V|` (the screw-space dimension)
against `D·(|V|−1)` (the matroid rank), with one bound an ℕ-truncated
subtraction (`dim Z ≤ D·|V| − #s`) and the other an ℤ inequality carrying
a signed `def` (`D·(|V|−1) − def ≤ #s`). Three traps stack: (a) the ℤ
side elaborates `(D·(|V|−1) : ℤ)` as the *distributed* `↑D * ↑(|V|−1)`,
a different atom from the ℕ product — `rw [← Nat.cast_mul]` undistributes
it to `↑(D·(|V|−1))`; (b) omega still sees `D·|V|` and `D·(|V|−1)` as two
unrelated nonlinear atoms — stage the bridge `D·|V| = D·(|V|−1) + D` (via
`conv_lhs => rw [show |V| = (|V|−1)+1 …]; rw [Nat.mul_add, Nat.mul_one]`),
`rw` it into the truncated bound, then `generalize D·(|V|−1) = Q'` to a
single fresh atom shared by both hypotheses and `clear` the now-stale
bridge; (c) the truncated branch (`#s > D·|V|` forcing `dim Z ≤ 0`) needs
the deficiency-nonnegativity fact (`deficiency_nonneg`) in scope or omega
finds a spurious counterexample with `def` very negative.

Canonical case: `rankHypothesis_ofNormals_of_rankPolynomial_algebraicIndependent`
in `AlgebraicInduction/CaseI.lean` (Phase 22d).

---

## 3. `nlinarith` over ℕ on quadratic bounds: `Nat.le_mul_self`

`nlinarith` over ℕ doesn't reliably close
`4 * d + 2 ≤ (d + 1) * (d + 2)`-shaped goals from scratch —
ℕ-subtraction truncates and it can't recover the squaring.

**Fix:** expand the quadratic with `ring`-via-`have`, surface
`d ≤ d * d` via `Nat.le_mul_self d`, then close with `omega`.

```lean
have : (d + 1) * (d + 2) = d * d + 3 * d + 2 := by ring
have : d ≤ d * d := Nat.le_mul_self d
omega
```

The pattern generalizes: any ℕ-quadratic bound where one side has
`d * d` and the other is linear in `d` benefits from
`Nat.le_mul_self` as the bridge.

Canonical case: `top_fin_two_isGenericallyRigid` in `Framework.lean`.

---

## 4. `subst` between two free variables picks the wrong one

When `h : a = b` has both sides free in scope, `subst h` eliminates
one — and Lean's heuristic is "the *less-recently-introduced* free
variable when both qualify." Two recurring traps:

- `rcases Sym2.eq_iff.mp h_eq with ⟨rfl, rfl⟩ | ⟨rfl, rfl⟩` inside
  an `induction e with | h u v => …` after a `by_cases h_eq : s(u, v)
  = s(a, b)`: the `rfl` patterns substitute *the theorem binders
  `a, b`* (older) rather than the case-split intros `u, v` (newer).
  A follow-up `have hflip : p b - p a = …` then fails with `Unknown
  identifier b`.
- `by_cases hvc : v = c; · subst hvc`: substitutes `c` (the function
  signature variable, older) and leaves `v`. Subsequent uses of `c`
  fail.

**Fix:** bind the equalities to named hypotheses and use `rw`, which
doesn't eliminate from the context:

```lean
rcases Sym2.eq_iff.mp h_eq with ⟨h1, h2⟩ | ⟨h1, h2⟩
· rw [h1, h2]; …
· rw [h1, h2, /- sign flip -/]; …
```

When `grind` is the closer it papers over this — both branches close
regardless of which variables remain. Reach for named hypotheses
only when downstream tactics depend on a specific name.

**When you genuinely want the substitution but in the *other*
direction** (e.g. you `by_cases hxa : x = a` on a destructured-link
local `x` and want to keep the section body `a`, not eliminate it),
use the **named-variable form `subst x`** (not `subst hxa`): `subst x`
eliminates the variable `x` regardless of which side of `hxa` it sits
on, replacing it by `a` and keeping every `a`/`c` reference downstream
intact. (Phase 22h W9b `case_III_bottom_relabel`: `subst hxa` killed
the section variable `a`, breaking the `hingeRow c v ρ'` tags; `subst
x` keeps `a`/`c`.)

**Cheapest fix when you already have the equality as a term (not yet `rcases`'d):** flip it with
`.symm` before `obtain rfl`/`rintro rfl`, rather than renaming or switching to `rw`. `obtain rfl :=
h` on `h : new = old` (new-side first) eliminates `old`, keeping `new` — the opposite of `h.symm :
old = new`, which eliminates `new`. E.g. `obtain rfl := (hsing v' hfv').symm` (where `hsing v'
hfv' : v' = v`, `v` the theorem's older bound variable, `v'` a `rintro`-introduced one) keeps `v'`
gone and `v` alive, matching every later reference to `v` in the proof — the un-flipped `obtain
rfl := hsing v' hfv'` instead kills `v` (JacobsCounting.lean's
`squareSpecialCrossEdgesRootedAt_eq_edgesIn_neighborSet`, Phase 32).

**Related: destructuring a *term* doesn't rewrite its occurrences.**
`obtain ⟨a, t⟩ := e j` (or `rcases e j with ⟨a, t⟩`) on a bare *term*
`e j` — as opposed to a local hypothesis — introduces `a, t` but does
**not** substitute the other `(e j).1` / `(e j).2` occurrences already
in the goal, so projection-mismatches (`a` here, `(e j).fst` there)
leave `unsolved goals`. Capture the equation and `simp` it instead:

```lean
rcases hej : e j with ⟨a, t⟩
simp only [hej]   -- now every `e j` is `⟨a, t⟩`; `.fst`/`.snd` reduce
```

(Phase 22 `exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn`, the `annihRowPoly`
coordinatization at a reindexed basis vector `e j : Σ _, ⋀ᵏ`.)

---

## 5. `simp only` leaves residual subterms that block `rw` motives

If you `simp only […]` and then a follow-up `rw [h]` fails with
*motive is not type correct*, citing a hypothesis (like `he`) that
doesn't appear in the displayed goal — suspect a `simp`-produced
residual subterm hiding inside an `Eq` proof.

**Fix:** insert `change <displayed clean form>` between the
`simp only` and the `rw`:

```lean
simp only [rigidityMap_apply, Pi.zero_apply, Function.comp_apply]
change ⟪p u - p v, x (some u) - x (some v)⟫_ℝ = 0
rw [h1, h2]; …
```

The `change` re-elaborates the goal at the surface type, discarding
the residual.

Canonical case: `typeII_isInfinitesimallyRigid_extend` in
`Henneberg.lean`.

---

## 6. `set name := fun t => …` + `simp [name]` doesn't unfold lambdas

`simp [name]` on a `set`-introduced abbreviation whose body is a
lambda often fails (or worse, gives a `⊢ sorry () c = …`-style
elaboration glitch).

**Fix:** prefer `let` plus explicit `have`-lemmas that state the
reductions you need:

```lean
let p_t : ℝ → Framework V 2 := fun t => Function.update p₀ c (p₀ c + t • w)
have h_p_t_c : ∀ t, p_t t c = p₀ c + t • w :=
  fun _ => Function.update_self c _ p₀
have h_p_t_ne : ∀ t v, v ≠ c → p_t t v = p₀ v :=
  fun _ v hvc => Function.update_of_ne hvc _ p₀
```

Reference the `have`-lemmas in downstream reasoning rather than
trying to round-trip through `simp [p_t]`.

---

## 7. `interval_cases` is for free variables, not function applications

`interval_cases (Fintype.card V)` enumerates the cases but does
**not** substitute `Fintype.card V` in the context — so an arm's
`Fintype.card V = 2` won't close by `rfl`. `interval_cases` only
performs `subst` on free *variables*.

**Fix:** for value equations on function applications, derive the
equation as a named hypothesis via `omega` (or `decide`, etc.) and
hand it to downstream lemmas explicitly:

```lean
by_cases hV3 : 3 ≤ Fintype.card V
· -- high branch
· -- low branch
  have hcard2 : Fintype.card V = 2 := by
    have := IsLaman.edgeSet_ncard …
    omega
  exact h.eq_top_of_card_eq_two hcard2
```

Canonical case: `IsLaman.isGenericallyRigidInj_two_of_card` in
`LamanTheorem.lean`.

---

## 8. Dot notation only consults the type's head namespace

Related traps:

- **Sub-namespace lookup fails.** Inside `namespace SimpleGraph.Henneberg`,
  with `h : G.IsLaman`, writing `h.exists_typeI_or_typeII_reverse …` looks
  up `SimpleGraph.IsLaman.exists_typeI_or_typeII_reverse`, **not**
  `SimpleGraph.Henneberg.IsLaman.exists_typeI_or_typeII_reverse`. Error
  appears as ``And.exists_typeI_or_typeII_reverse not found`` because Lean
  unfolds `IsLaman → IsTight → And` while searching. Fix: call by
  explicit name from inside the sub-namespace —
  `IsLaman.exists_typeI_or_typeII_reverse h …` resolves correctly via the
  partial-prefix lookup.
- **Same-name wrapper recurses.** Inside `theorem
  EdgeSetRowIndependent.mono`, writing `hI.mono h` resolves `.mono`
  to *the function being defined* (Lean prefers the head namespace
  of the term's *stated* type before unfolding), not the upstream
  `LinearIndepOn.mono` you intended. Spell out the upstream name
  explicitly when wrapping a same-named upstream lemma.
- **Forward reference to a not-yet-declared sibling misreports as
  `Function.foo`.** `hc.affineIndependent_comp …`, with `hc :
  IsGeneralPositionPlacement p`, failed with *"the environment does
  not contain `Function.affineIndependent_comp`"* and a fully-unfolded
  printed type for `hc` (the `∀ s, …` body, not `IsGeneralPositionPlacement
  p`) — not because of a namespace mismatch, but because the target
  theorem `IsGeneralPositionPlacement.affineIndependent_comp` was
  declared **later in the same file** (elaboration is top-to-bottom, so
  it wasn't in the environment yet at the call site). Dot notation
  silently falls back through `whnf`-unfolding the `def`-headed type to
  the generic `Function` namespace instead of reporting "not yet
  declared" directly; spelling out the fully-qualified name
  (`IsGeneralPositionPlacement.affineIndependent_comp hc …`) turns the
  confusing fallback into a clear *"Unknown constant"*, which is the
  cue to check declaration order (move the new lemma after its
  dependency, or the dependency before it) rather than debug namespaces.
- **A `simp`-destructured `Ne` fails `.symm`.** `simp only [not_or] at h`
  (or any tactic that produces a raw `¬(a = b)` conjunct rather than a
  syntactic `a ≠ b`) leaves a hypothesis whose *stated* type is `Not (a =
  b)`; calling `.symm` on it errors *"the environment does not contain
  `Function.symm`"* — dot notation unfolds `Not` to the underlying `a = b
  → False` Pi type and looks in the `Function` namespace, the same failure
  mode as the forward-reference bullet above, just triggered by a
  `simp`-produced `Not` instead of a `def`. Fix: apply the lemma by name
  instead of by projection — `Ne.symm h` (works regardless of whether `h`'s
  printed type folds back to `Ne` or stays as `Not (a = b)`, since ordinary
  application unifies rather than projects on the head).
- **An explicit type ascription does not redirect dot notation.** `(hdef :
  G.IsKDof n 0).exists_isBase_isForestPacking hne`, with `hdef : G.deficiency n
  = 0` and `IsKDof G n k := G.deficiency n = k` (a plain `def`, defeq but not
  reducible-transparent), fails with *"the environment does not contain
  `Eq.exists_isBase_isForestPacking`"* — dot-notation resolution looks at
  `hdef`'s type via `whnf` (which unfolds `IsKDof` straight through to `Eq`),
  not at the ascribed type `G.IsKDof n 0`; the ascription changes what the
  *term* elaborates against, not which namespace the *following* projection
  searches. Fix: call the lemma by its fully-qualified name and pass the
  original hypothesis positionally — `IsKDof.exists_isBase_isForestPacking
  hdef hne` — letting ordinary argument-defeq (not dot-notation head lookup)
  bridge `G.deficiency n = 0` to the expected `H.IsKDof n 0`. Phase 34 Layer BH
  (`deficiency_eq_zero_iff_exists_spanningTrees`, `Deficiency.lean`).

---

## 9. `congr_fun` does not apply to `EuclideanSpace`

`EuclideanSpace ℝ ι` is `PiLp 2 (fun _ => ℝ)`, not `ι → ℝ`. Even
though the carrier coerces, `congr_fun h 0` errors out with
`Application type mismatch`. To extract a coordinate, route through
a continuous map (norm, inner product) or use `EuclideanSpace.equiv`
/ `PiLp.equiv` for an explicit conversion. Same caveat for `Sym2 V` —
projection there goes through `Sym2.lift`, not `congr_fun`.

The **reverse direction** — *proving* two `EuclideanSpace`/`PiLp` values equal from their
coordinates — has the same gap under the `funext` *tactic* (not just the term `congr_fun`):
`funext m` on a goal `x = y` with `x y : EuclideanSpace ℝ ι` fails with *"could not unify the
conclusion of `@funext` … with the goal"*, for the identical reason (`EuclideanSpace`/`PiLp` isn't
syntactically a Pi type, only reducibly one). Use the tactic `ext m` instead — it resolves to the
registered `@[ext] PiLp.ext` lemma and produces the expected per-coordinate goal.

---

## 10. `simp_all` can cross-contaminate with destructive equality hypotheses

If `simp_all` encounters `hij : 0 = X`, it may rewrite *every*
occurrence of `0` in the context to `X` — including inside
hypotheses you wanted to keep. When `simp_all` produces a confusing
residual goal involving a hypothesis you expected to eliminate,
suspect cross-rewriting. Route through a derived quantity that
doesn't trigger it:

```lean
have h_norm : ‖p i‖ = ‖p j‖ := congrArg _ hij
revert h_norm <;> simp [hp_def]
```

---

## 11. `linearIndependent_fin2` leaves `![v₀, v₁] 0 / 1` unsimplified

After `rw [linearIndependent_fin2] at hLI`, the destructured form
carries `![v₀, v₁] 0` and `![v₀, v₁] 1` at the indexing layer, which
won't match patterns like `p₀ c - p₀ a` in downstream goals. Always
pair with the matrix-indexing simp set:

```lean
rw [linearIndependent_fin2] at hLI
simp only [Matrix.cons_val_zero, Matrix.cons_val_one] at hLI
```

then `push Not`, `obtain`, etc.

---

## 12. `congr_fun` does not apply to `LinearMap` (or any `FunLike`)

`LinearMap` (and `Module.Dual R M = M →ₗ[R] R`, and other `FunLike`
types) is *not* a raw `Function`, even though it coerces to one. So
`congr_fun (hcd : f = g)` errors with `Application type mismatch`
when `f, g : M →ₗ[R] N`. Use `DFunLike.congr_fun hcd x` (works for
any `FunLike`) or `LinearMap.congr_fun hcd x` (specific). Same caveat
for `LinearEquiv`, `AlgHom`, `ContinuousLinearMap`, etc.

This is a sibling of §9 (`EuclideanSpace` is `PiLp`, not `Pi`); both
fall under *"acts like a function but isn't literally one."* The
error message is identical (`Application type mismatch`), so
recognize the symptom: any failed `congr_fun` whose target is a
bundled morphism wants `DFunLike.congr_fun` instead.

## 13. Subscript `₊` (U+208A) is not a valid identifier character

Pasting an identifier like `V₊` or `s₊` from blueprint / notes prose
into Lean produces a baffling `expected token` error at the column
of the subscript-plus, and the parser then dumps the local context
with the partial name as `V : ?m.… := sorry`. Lean's identifier
rules (per Unicode XID_Continue) accept letters and digit-like
subscripts (`₁ ₂ ₃ … ₀`) but classify `₊` (U+208A "subscript plus
sign") as a math symbol, not a letter — it cannot continue an
identifier. Same for `₋` (U+208B), `₌` (U+208C), `₍ ₎`.

Replace with an alphanumeric suffix (`V_pos`, `Vpos`, `Vp`, `S`)
when binding via `set` / `let` / `intro`. Blueprint prose can keep
the `₊` notation; only the Lean identifier needs to change.

## 14. `Finset.univ.filter` of `Finset V` under `[Finite V]` triggers cascading instance synthesis friction

Defining a `Finset (Finset V)` via `Finset.univ.filter p` requires
in order: `Fintype V` (for the outer `Finset.univ`, derived from
`[Finite V]` via `Fintype.ofFinite`), `DecidablePred p` (rarely
`Decidable` for a custom predicate involving `Set.ncard` /
`IsTightOn`, so use `Classical.decPred`), and `DecidableEq V` (to
get `SemilatticeSup (Finset V)` for `Finset.sup`). When the
definition is wrapped in a `noncomputable def` body that the
elaborator must unfold during a downstream proof, the chain of
`letI` / `haveI` / `Classical.decPred` / `open Classical in`
choices in the def *do not always reduce to the proof-side
instances picked by `classical`*. Symptom: `change` or `unfold`
followed by `Finset.sup_mem` either fails with "Invalid `⟨...⟩`
notation" or times out at `whnf`.

**Resolution.** Define the family as a `Set V` first
(`⋃ S, ⋃ (_ : p S), (↑S : Set V)`) — no `Finset.univ`, no
`Fintype`, no `DecidablePred` — then convert to `Finset V` via
`Set.Finite.toFinset` (the finiteness proof is
`(Set.toFinite Set.univ).subset (Set.subset_univ _)` under
`[Finite V]`). Membership unfolds via `Set.Finite.mem_toFinset`
+ `Set.mem_iUnion` + `and_assoc`. When the proof genuinely needs
the Finset-join form (e.g.\ for `Finset.sup_mem`), bridge with a
single `Finset.ext`-driven equality `maxBlock X = F.sup id` that
isolates the instance friction to one spot.

Worked example: `SimpleGraph.maxBlock` / `SimpleGraph.IsSparse.maxBlock_isTightOn`
in `Sparsity.lean` (Phase 7 Commit 17b). Pattern is useful for any
"Finset of Finsets" construction over a `[Finite V]` ambient.

## 15. Bare `Polynomial.X` (or `0`, `1`) needs explicit type ascription in `let`/`set` of a `Polynomial`-valued expression

Writing

```lean
set P : Polynomial ℝ := (Polynomial.X • M₁.map C + M₀.map C).det
-- or, equivalently, as a let:
let P : Polynomial ℝ := (Polynomial.X • M₁.map C + M₀.map C).det
```

fails with `typeclass instance problem is stuck: Semiring ?m` even
though the outer ascription `: Polynomial ℝ` *would* fix the ring if
the elaborator consulted it. The matrix entries `M₁.map C` *do* live
in `Polynomial ℝ`, so the `•` action is well-typed once the scalar's
ring is fixed — but the parser commits to elaborating `Polynomial.X`
bottom-up before unifying with the action's scalar type, and there's
no constraint at that point telling it which `Polynomial R` to pick.
Same trap applies to bare `0` / `1` in a `Polynomial`-valued context
(e.g. `let p : Polynomial ℝ := 1 - X • Y` where `1` and `X` both
need help).

**Resolution.** Annotate the literal explicitly:

```lean
set P : Polynomial ℝ :=
  ((Polynomial.X : Polynomial ℝ) • M₁.map C + M₀.map C).det
```

Recognition: when the error message says `Semiring ?m.…` /
`Monoid ?m.…` / `Module ?m.… ?m.…` (one or more metavariables in the
typeclass arguments) on an expression that *looks* well-typed
because of the surrounding `: Polynomial ℝ` ascription, look first
for a bare `Polynomial.X` (or `0`, `1`, `C r`) whose containing ring
is set by the surrounding context but not by the local syntax.

**`MvPolynomial.X` in a `noncomputable def` body is the same trap**
(Phase 14, `Graph.kFrameRowR`): `fun e j => MvPolynomial.X (e, j) •
D.signedIncMatrix R e` in a def whose *return type* fixes the ring
still fails with `typeclass instance problem is stuck: CommSemiring
?m (e j)` — the `•` scalar's ring is determined by the result type
the elaborator hasn't reached when it commits to `MvPolynomial.X`.
Fix is identical: `(MvPolynomial.X (e, j) : MvPolynomial (β × Fin k)
ℚ) • …`.

Worked examples: `exists_affinelySpanning_rigid_placement` in
`RigidityMatroid.lean` and `finite_setOf_not_linearIndependent_rows_along_affine_path`
in `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean` — same workaround,
different proofs, two phases apart.

## 16. `termination_by` / `decreasing_by` elaboration rescue

Defining a well-founded recursive function with a non-trivial
termination measure trips three closely-related elaboration quirks.
All three surfaced during the Phase-9 DFS warmup's
`reachableFindingAux`; the rescues below are cheap and worth applying
prophylactically.

**a. Typeclasses used only in the termination measure must be bound
explicitly on the def, not via `variable`.** A `variable [Fintype V]`
auto-binds typeclasses by usage order — if the function body only
needs `[DecidableEq V]` but the `termination_by (Finset.univ \
visited).card` clause uses `[Fintype V]`, Lean inserts `[Fintype V]`
at the *end* of the auto-bound signature (after the explicit args).
The recursive-call recognizer then sees a function whose trailing
implicit doesn't match the call site, producing the cryptic
*"MVar does not look like a recursive call: ... → V → Fintype V"*
(with `Fintype V` shown as a trailing argument it can't unify).
Pinning the typeclasses explicitly on the def — `def f [Fintype V]
[DecidableEq V] (...) : ...` — fixes the order and the error.

**b. `termination_by` doesn't see pattern-match binders from
`| pattern => body` style.** Writing the body with
`def f : ∀ (visited : Finset V) (v : V), ... | visited, v => …` and
then `termination_by (Finset.univ \ visited).card` errors with
*"Unknown identifier `visited`"* — the `visited` in the pattern is
local to the match, not visible to the trailing clauses. Restructure
to named def params: `def f (visited : Finset V) (v : V) : ... :=
body`; `visited` is then in scope for `termination_by` /
`decreasing_by`.

**c. Hypotheses bound by `if h : ...` and used only in `decreasing_by`
still trigger `unused variable` lint.** Lean's WF tactic block runs
in a context that includes the path conditions to the recursive
call — `if hv : v ∈ visited then none else …` makes `hv : ¬ v ∈
visited` available inside `decreasing_by` to discharge the sdiff
strict-monotonicity proof. But the linter doesn't recognize WF-block
usage and warns `unused variable hv`. Rename the binder to `_hv` —
underscore-prefixed names are valid identifiers in Lean (still
referenceable as `_hv` inside `decreasing_by`) and the linter
silences itself.

**d. A `Finset.univ`-based measure that wants a `[Finite ι]`
signature (not `[Fintype ι]`): inject the `Fintype` inside
`termination_by`.** The complement of (a): sometimes the *body*
doesn't need `Fintype ι` in its type, so the `linter.unusedFintypeInType`
linter flags `[Fintype ι]` as unused-in-type and asks for `[Finite ι]`
+ `Fintype.ofFinite`. But if `termination_by ∑ i, (A i).card` (or any
`Finset.univ`-based measure) still needs a `Fintype ι`, swapping the
signature to `[Finite ι]` breaks the measure — `Fintype.ofFinite` is a
*def*, not an `instance`, so `∑ i` can't synthesize it, giving *"failed
to synthesize Fintype ι"* at the `termination_by` line plus an *"MVar
does not look like a recursive call"* on the def. The fix is to prefix
the measure with a local instance: `termination_by haveI :=
Fintype.ofFinite ι; ∑ i, (A i).card`. The `haveI` is in scope for the
measure expression, and the `decreasing_by` block's `Finset.univ`
matches it (so `Finset.sum_lt_sum` / `mem_univ` apply); the body proper
gets its decidability via a `classical` and its own `Fintype` is no
longer in the type. Worked example: `Matroid.generalized_halls_marriage`
in `CombinatorialRigidity/Matroid/Constructions/Submodular.lean`.

**Bonus: `mutual` recursion fails structural recursion when a
helper's parameter type depends on the other helper's parameter.**
The cleanest first attempt was a `mutual` block of
`reachableFindingAux` and `reachableFindingChildren` with the
children-list parameter typed `List {u // u ∈ succ v}` — but Lean
rejects structural recursion because the list's element type
depends on the function parameter `v`. Workaround: collapse into a
single function with the children loop inlined via `List.findSome?`
on `(succ v).attach`. Lean's WF tactic *can* see the recursive call
inside the `findSome?` lambda; the `(Finset.univ \ visited).card`
measure dispatches in one `decreasing_by` proof.

Worked example: `reachableFindingAux` in
`CombinatorialRigidity/Search/DFS.lean` (Phase-9 DFS warmup body
fill). Cross-reference: DESIGN.md *Pebble-game style island* notes
the math/exec-layer split (`succ : V → List V` for computability,
`visited : Finset V` for the WF measure) that ties (a) and (c)
together.

## 17. `match h : <expr> with | pat => …` substitutes `expr ↦ pat` in the goal of each branch

Using term-mode `match h : <expr> with | pat => body` introduces
`h : <expr> = pat` *and* refines the goal of `body` by substituting
`<expr>` with `pat`. The hypothesis `h` carries the un-substituted
direction (`<expr> = pat`); the goal is the substituted form. The
two are not the same expression, even though they hold the same
information.

**Symptom:** *"Application type mismatch: heq has type X = some ⟨w, p⟩
but is expected to have type some ⟨w, p⟩ = some ⟨w, p⟩"* when trying
to use `heq` to discharge a goal that was *itself* about `X` and now
reads as a tautology after the substitution.

**Fix.** Two options depending on what you need:

- If the goal collapsed to `pat = pat`, just return `rfl`:
  ```lean
  match heq : reachableFinding succ P v with
  | some ⟨w', p'⟩ => exact ⟨w', p', rfl⟩
  | none => …
  ```
- If you need the un-substituted form of `heq` (e.g. to feed it to a
  lemma that wants `X = none`), restructure to a `by_contra` over the
  un-substituted goal and `cases h_eq : <expr> with` inside (tactic
  mode `cases :` preserves both directions):
  ```lean
  by_contra hne
  have hnone : reachableFinding … = none := by
    cases h_eq : reachableFinding … with
    | none => rfl
    | some wp => exact absurd h_eq (hne wp.1 wp.2)
  exact absurd … (helper … hnone …)
  ```
- If you're **building data, not proving a `Prop`**, and the data
  construction itself needs the un-substituted equation (typical when
  you're defining a verdict / wrapper that pattern-matches on an
  expression and feeds the equation to a lemma to populate proof
  fields), route through an `aux` helper that takes the scrutinee and
  its equation as **separate** explicit arguments:
  ```lean
  noncomputable def foo_result.aux (... )
      (s : Sum A B) (h_opt : foo G = s) : Result G := match s, h_opt with
    | .inr D, h_opt => .accept D (helper_underline h_opt) (helper_reach h_opt)
    | .inl w, h_opt => .reject w.V' (helper_size h_opt w) (helper_lt h_opt w)

  noncomputable def foo_result (G : ...) : Result G :=
    foo_result.aux G (foo G) rfl
  ```
  The outer `match s, h_opt with | .inr D, h_opt => ...` binds `h_opt`
  to `runPebbleGame G k ℓ = .inr D` (the un-substituted equation; the
  fact that `s` is now `.inr D` is the *pattern* equation, not a goal
  substitution because the outer scrutinee `s` is an arbitrary
  argument). The wrapper `foo_result G := foo_result.aux G (foo G) rfl`
  then specializes the helper. **Trade:** two named declarations
  instead of one; **benefit:** every reference to `h_opt` carries the
  type that downstream lemmas (`runPebbleGame_underline_eq_edgeFinset`,
  `runPebbleGameWith_witness_bridges`, etc.) actually expect.

Worked case study: `reachableFinding_complete` in
`CombinatorialRigidity/Search/DFS.lean` (Phase-9 DFS warmup). First
attempt extracted the witness directly via `match heq:`; the `some`
branch's `exact ⟨w', p', heq⟩` failed at the application because the
goal had collapsed to `some ⟨w', p'⟩ = some ⟨w', p'⟩` while `heq`
retained the original `reachableFinding … = some ⟨w', p'⟩`. The
contrapositive `by_contra + cases h_eq:` form sidesteps both
directions cleanly.

The third (data-building) fix above is canonical at Phase 11 Layer 4b's
`runPebbleGame.aux` + `runPebbleGame` pattern in
`CombinatorialRigidity/PebbleGame/Correctness.lean`, and at the
exec-layer sibling `runPebbleGameExec.aux` + `runPebbleGameExec` in
`PebbleGame/Exec.lean`. (Layer 4 originally landed these as additive
`runPebbleGame_result.aux` / `runPebbleGameExec_result.aux` wrappers
alongside the `Option`-returning predecessors; Layer 4b's maximal
reshape collapsed the `_result` suffixes into the wrappers
themselves.) The same lifting applies whenever a definition needs to
pattern-match on a scrutinee and feed the equation to several
proof-field lemmas.

---

## 18. `rw [h]` over a structure field whose value appears in another local's type

If a hypothesis `h : D.field = ...` is used with `rw [h]` (or
`conv => rw [h]`) and the goal contains a local `p` whose *type*
mentions `D.field`, the rewrite tries to abstract the type-level
occurrence and fails with *motive is not type correct*.

**Symptom.** *"Tactic `rewrite` failed: motive is not type correct"*
on a goal where `D.field` appears in a Finset / membership form,
plus a `p`-derived term (`p.foo`, `p.bar`) appears elsewhere — and
`p`'s type references `D.field`.

**Fix.** Don't use `rw [h]` to substitute the field. Instead, build
the rewritten *Finset* (or whatever container) equation as a `have`
via `Finset.ext`, then use that equation as a single `rw` unit
whose motive is the trivial container-level one (e.g.
`λ s, s.card`):

```lean
have h_decomp : D.arcs.filter P =
    (D.arcs \ p.arcsFinset).filter P ∪ p.arcsFinset.filter P := by
  ext x; simp only [Finset.mem_filter, Finset.mem_union,
    Finset.mem_sdiff]
  -- ... explicit forward/backward via by_cases on x ∈ p.arcsFinset
rw [h_decomp, Finset.card_union_of_disjoint …]
```

The `ext` block constructs the equation pointwise, never substituting
`D.arcs` anywhere. Once the equation exists, the subsequent `rw`
abstracts only the container, not its underlying field. The same
trick generalises to any container-equality-via-`rw` step that
crosses a local with a value-dependent type.

Worked case study: `PartialOrientation.out_reverse_add` in
`CombinatorialRigidity/PebbleGame/Basic.lean` (Phase-9). The path
`p : DirectedWalk (fun a b => (a, b) ∈ D.arcs) u w` ties `D.arcs`
into `p`'s type, and the goal contains `p.vertices` (via the
`if v ∈ p.vertices ∧ … then 1 else 0` clauses); `rw [h_decomp]`
with `h_decomp : D.arcs = (D.arcs \ p.arcsFinset) ∪ p.arcsFinset`
fails. The `ext`-based replacement above closes cleanly.

---

## 19. `induction … using funName.induct` on a function with `let` in its body

The auto-generated `funName.induct` recursor for a function defined
with `termination_by` faithfully mirrors the function's body — which
means a `let x := <expr>` (or `have x := <expr>`) in the body
becomes a `let`/`have` clause in each affected case of the recursor.
Two related traps surface together when using `induction _ using
funName.induct`:

**a. The `let`-bound name consumes a case-binder slot.** When you
write `case caseN D h₁ h₂ ... =>` to name the binders for a case,
each `let x := <expr>;` in the case's hypothesis chain takes a
slot. The displayed signature shows it as `let x := …;` rather than
`∀ x, …`, but it elaborates as a real binder. If you skip its name,
Lean shifts the remaining names by one and produces a confusing
type error on whatever now-misaligned hypothesis you first try to
use.

**Symptom.** *"Application type mismatch: hypothesis `hX` has type
`<wrong type>` but is expected to have type ..."* where the displayed
"wrong type" matches the `let`-bound term (e.g. `V → Bool` when the
let binds `P : V → Bool`).

**Fix.** Include the let-bound name in the case's binder list. For
a case introduced by `let P := …;` followed by `∀ (r : …), …`, write
`case caseN D h₁ h₂ ... P r ... =>` rather than
`case caseN D h₁ h₂ ... r ... =>`. Use `#check @funName.induct` (or
`lean_hover_info` via MCP) to see the exact let / have / ∀ chain in
each case before naming.

**b. The inner `let`-binding shadows the case binder when rewriting.**
After `rw [funName] at h` unfolds the function definition in a
hypothesis, the inner `let x := <expr>;` introduces a fresh local
binding for `x` *inside* `h`, distinct from the case binder of the
same name. A subsequent `rw [hyp] at h` where `hyp`'s LHS references
the case-binder `x` will fail with *"Did not find an occurrence of
the pattern"* because the pattern uses the case-binder `x` while
the occurrence in `h` uses the inner let-bound `x` — they're
different terms even though they print identically.

**Symptom.** `rw [hyp] at h` whose LHS visibly appears in `h`
fails with *"Did not find an occurrence of the pattern"*; the
displayed `h` contains a `let x := …;` clause shadowing your case
binder.

**Fix.** Apply `dsimp only at h` *after* the `rw [funName] …`
unfold to inline the inner `let`, replacing every `x` in `h` with
`<expr>`. The case-binder `x` and the inlined `<expr>` in `h` now
elaborate to the same term, and the subsequent `rw [hyp] at h`
works.

**Bonus: `match c with | ... | none => none` doesn't auto-reduce
when `c` becomes `none`.** After `rw [hu_none, hv_none] at h`
substitutes both discriminees in a nested `match`, `h` ends up as
`(match none with | some r => … | none => match none with | some r
=> … | none => none) = some D'`. `Option.noConfusion h` fails
because the LHS hasn't reduced to a constructor. Discharge with
`exact nomatch h` (or `cases h`, or `simp at h`), all of which
trigger the match reduction as part of pattern-matching the
hypothesis. The fix is one tactic and never the deep-issue, but
worth knowing so you don't reach for `Option.noConfusion` first.

Worked case study: `tryAddEdgeWith_reachable` in
`CombinatorialRigidity/PebbleGame/Algorithm.lean` (Phase 9). The function
`tryAddEdgeWith`'s below-threshold branch binds `let P : V → Bool
:= fun w => decide (0 < D.peb k w) && …`; `tryAddEdgeWith.induct`
surfaces `P` as a binder in three of its five cases. The recursive-
branch proofs needed `dsimp only at h` after `rw [tryAddEdgeWith,
dif_neg hthr] at h` to inline the inner let before the
`hu_none`/`hv_none` rewrites would land; the both-DFS-fail branch
needed `exact nomatch h` after the rewrites to discharge the
contradiction.

## 20. `rw [eq]` after `obtain ⟨rfl, _⟩` on a cons-pattern endpoint trips motive on the sibling walk's type

When a cons-pattern induction binds a sibling walk
`q : DirectedWalk R u_int w` and a `Sym2.eq_iff` / `Prod.mk.inj`
decomposition then substitutes one of the cons-pattern endpoints
(`u_out := v` via `obtain ⟨rfl, _⟩`), a *downstream* `rw [eq]` on a
`q.vertices`-mentioning goal can fail with *"motive is not type
correct"*. The sibling walk's type still references the *other*
substituted endpoint, and Lean's motive abstraction tries to rewrite
that endpoint inside `q`'s type.

This is one tactic step downstream of § 4 (*`subst` between two free
variables picks the wrong one*): § 4 covers the *direction* of the
substitution; § 20 covers the *motive failure on the downstream
`rw`* after either substitution direction succeeds.

**Symptom.** Inside `induction p with | cons _ _ _ _ q ih => …`
(where `q : DirectedWalk R u_int w`), `obtain ⟨rfl, _⟩` succeeds and
substitutes `u_out := v`. Then `rw [h_eq]` with `h_eq : v = u_int` on
a goal `v ∈ q.vertices` fails with *"motive is not type correct"* —
even though `v` is plainly visible in the goal.

**Fix.** Don't `obtain ⟨rfl, _⟩`. Bind both pair equalities to named
hypotheses, compose them into a single equation between the two
endpoints, and `rw` on the *un*-substituted endpoint (which doesn't
appear in the sibling walk's type — only the other one does):

```lean
have h_uo : v = u_out := (Prod.mk.inj heq).1
have h_ui : v = u_int := (Prod.mk.inj heq).2
have h_outint : u_out = u_int := h_uo.symm.trans h_ui
rw [h_outint] -- rewrites u_out, which is NOT in q's type
```

For the canonical case of "*the source vertex is in `p.vertices`*",
the project-internal helper `DirectedWalk.head_mem_vertices`
(`Search/DFS.lean:154`, `@[simp]`) collapses the typical
`cases q <;> simp [vertices]` follow-up dance:

```lean
@[simp] lemma head_mem_vertices {u w : V} (p : DirectedWalk R u w) :
    u ∈ p.vertices := …
```

Worked case study: `IsPath.notMem_loop_arcsFinset` and
`IsPath.notMem_antiparallel_arcsFinset` in
`CombinatorialRigidity/Search/DFS.lean`.

## 21. `ring` fails on alpha-renamed `Finset.sum`s — `omega` / `linarith` as atom extractor

A goal shaped `Σ + B = B + Σ'` where `Σ` and `Σ'` are
alpha-equivalent `Finset.sum`s — same Finset, same body modulo a
bound-variable rename — fails to close with `ring`. The atom
extractor checks *syntactic* identity on lambda bodies, not full
defeq, so `∑ x ∈ s, f x` and `∑ y ∈ s, f y` register as distinct
atoms even though they're propositionally equal.

The rescue exploits a property already documented in § 1:
`omega` (over ℕ) and `linarith` (over ordered fields) treat each
`Finset.sum` as an *opaque atomic term*, which means they don't care
whether two surface forms alpha-match — both forms reduce to the
same atom symbol in their internal representation.

**Symptom.** A residual goal like
`∑ x ∈ V' \ {u, v}, peb k x + (peb u + peb v) = peb u + peb v + ∑ w ∈ V' \ {u, v}, peb k w`
where the LHS / RHS bound variables (`x` vs `w`) don't match,
`ring` reports *"unsolved goals"*, `ring_nf` produces a non-closing
form, and `omega` directly doesn't see the equation (the two sums
are still separate atoms even after `omega` normalisation).

**Fix.** Don't try to make the two sums syntactically equal. Bind
each sum identity (e.g. `Finset.sum_sdiff`, `Finset.sum_pair`) as a
named `have` hypothesis with the bound variable Lean prefers, then
let `omega` / `linarith` close the surrounding linear (in)equality
using the sum-identity `have`s as opaque facts:

```lean
have h_sdiff : ∑ x ∈ V' \ ({u, v} : Finset V), D.peb k x +
                 ∑ x ∈ ({u, v} : Finset V), D.peb k x =
               D.pebOn k V' := by rw [pebOn]; exact Finset.sum_sdiff huv_sub
have h_pair : ∑ x ∈ ({u, v} : Finset V), D.peb k x = D.peb k u + D.peb k v :=
  Finset.sum_pair huv
have h_pos : 0 < ∑ w ∈ V' \ ({u, v} : Finset V), D.peb k w := by omega
```

The two `have`s name the two pieces; `omega` chains them through
the linear arithmetic without needing the bound variables to align.

This is the same atom-opacity property § 1 weaponises for omega
*input* — § 21 weaponises it as a `ring` *rescue* when the alpha-
mismatch surfaces unexpectedly. If the rescue doesn't fire (e.g. the
surrounding identity is non-linear), the next reach is
`Finset.sum_congr rfl (fun _ _ => rfl)` to rename the bound variable
explicitly before `ring`.

Worked case study: `Reachable.independent_brings_pebble` in
`CombinatorialRigidity/PebbleGame/Basic.lean` (Phase 9 *Reachability*
section — Lemma 13 algebraic core, consumed by the *Completeness*
chain in `PebbleGame/Correctness.lean`). The `pebOn V' = peb u + peb v + ∑ w ∈ V' \ {u, v}, peb k w`
decomposition closes via the two-`have` + `omega` chain above; the
follow-up `Finset.exists_ne_zero_of_sum_ne_zero` then extracts the
blocking witness from `h_pos`.

## 22. `LinearOrder.lift'` on a `SetLike` type silently breaks `Decidable (· ≤ ·)`

A type `α` that is `SetLike α β` for some `β` already has a
`PartialOrder α` instance from `SetLike.instPartialOrder` (the
subset order on coercions). Registering a different `LinearOrder α`
via `LinearOrder.lift'` (or `LinearOrder.lift`) succeeds at
elaboration time but does not actually replace the SetLike
PartialOrder, so:

- `inferInstance : Decidable (a ≤ b : α)` fails with *"failed to
  synthesize instance of type class Decidable (a ≤ b)"*.
- `Finset.sort (· ≤ ·) : Finset α → List α` fails with *"failed
  to synthesize instance of type class DecidableRel fun x1 x2 ↦
  x1 ≤ x2"*.
- `fast_instance%` reports *"Provided instance ... is not defeq to
  inferred instance ... LinearOrder.toPartialOrder"*.

**Symptom (concrete).** Phase 10 attempted to mirror
`LinearOrder (Sym2 V)` via the pullback of the
`α × α`-lex order along `Sym2.sortEquiv`. The instance accepted at
declaration time, but every `inferInstance : Decidable (s ≤ t)`
downstream failed. `fast_instance%` surfaced the underlying problem:
mathlib's `instance : PartialOrder (Sym2 α) := .ofSetLike (Sym2 α) α`
(the subset order — non-total since `s({1,2})` and `s({1,3})` are
incomparable as sets) was the inferred PartialOrder, and the lifted
LinearOrder's `toPartialOrder` field disagreed.

**Cause.** Lean's typeclass resolution finds the SetLike-derived
`PartialOrder α` first; the new `LinearOrder α` instance's
`toPartialOrder` field is then inconsistent with it. The two-way
diamond on `PartialOrder α` means the resulting `LinearOrder α`
instance never "wins" — typeclass search falls back to the SetLike
one for `≤`, which is not the relation the LinearOrder agrees with.
The mathlib `SetLike` design intentionally claims the
`PartialOrder` slot for any such type.

**Rescue.** Two options, in order of preference:

1. **Sort through `Lex (β)`, not through a new `α` instance.** If
   `α` projects to some type `β` (e.g. `Sym2 V` projects to `V × V`
   via `Sym2.sortEquiv`'s `(·.inf, ·.sup)`), image into
   `Lex (β)` (which has the `Prod.Lex.instLinearOrder` from
   mathlib), sort there, and map back. No new instance required.
   This is what `SimpleGraph.edgeListSorted` in
   `CombinatorialRigidity/PebbleGame/Exec.lean` does.

2. **Wrap in `Lex` and register on the wrapped type.** Register
   `instance : LinearOrder (Lex α)` via `LinearOrder.lift'`; the
   `Lex α` slot doesn't have the SetLike PartialOrder and so accepts
   the lifted instance cleanly. Downstream code does
   `s.image toLex |>.sort (· ≤ ·) |>.map ofLex` to use it. Heavier
   than option 1 if the only use site is one sort call.

**Diagnosis pattern.** A `LinearOrder.lift'`-built `LinearOrder α`
instance whose `inferInstance : Decidable (a ≤ b)` doesn't fire is
almost always SetLike conflict. Quick check: `#check (inferInstance
: PartialOrder α)` — if it elaborates to a `SetLike`-derived
PartialOrder (vs. the one your lifted LinearOrder provides), the
slot is claimed.

Worked case study: the failed `Mathlib/Data/Sym/Sym2/Order.lean`
mirror in Phase 10's Layer 1 (see `notes/Phase10.md` *Layer 0 audit
\#1 (revised at Layer 1)*).

## 23. `#eval`-bearing `module` files need `public meta import` for the imported `Decidable` / elaboration instances

`#eval` elaborates its argument at **meta time**, synthesising
`Decidable` / `Repr` / `ToExpr` / etc. instances through the
*meta-time* environment. In a `module` file, a plain
`public import X` exposes `X`'s declarations only to the importing
file's compile-time and runtime layers — not to meta-time
elaboration. Symptom on the first `#eval (decide P)` from a
freshly-converted `module` file:

```
Invalid `meta` definition `_eval`, `instDecidableP` is not accessible
here; consider adding `public meta import X`
```

The compiler error names exactly the module to add as a `public meta
import`. The fix is to keep the existing `public import X` line and
add a second-form `public meta import X` immediately after it. The
two import lines coexist: `public import` covers runtime visibility
(for `def` / `theorem` bodies that reference `X`'s declarations);
`public meta import` covers meta-time visibility (for `#eval` /
`#check` / `#reduce` / `decide`-tactic elaboration that reaches into
`X`'s instance pool).

**Worked case.** Phase 10 Layer 4
(`CombinatorialRigidity/PebbleGame/Examples.lean`) ships `#eval
(decide G.IsLaman)` lines that need the
`SimpleGraph.instDecidableIsLaman` instance from
`PebbleGame/Exec.lean`. The header is

```
public import CombinatorialRigidity.PebbleGame.Exec
public meta import CombinatorialRigidity.PebbleGame.Exec
```

— same module imported twice in different roles. Without the second
line, every `#eval (decide …)` reports the *"not accessible here"*
error pointing at the missing instance.

**Closest mathlib precedent.** `Mathlib/Tactic/Check.lean` and
several other tactic-bearing files in `Mathlib/Tactic/` use `public
meta import` for `Lean.Elab.*` / `Lean.PrettyPrinter.*` (where the
tactic implementation needs Lean elaborator-internals at meta time).
For pure `#eval`-bearing user files, the project's first instance is
`PebbleGame/Examples.lean`.

**When this fires vs. doesn't.** The rule is *what kind of
visibility does the consumer need?*

- `def foo := …` using `X`'s declarations in its body → `public
  import X` is sufficient.
- `theorem bar : … := by simp [X.lemma]` → `public import X` is
  sufficient (the `simp` lemma database is populated at compile
  time).
- `#eval P` where `P` reduces through `X`'s instances → needs
  `public meta import X`.
- `example : … := by decide` where `decide` synthesises an instance
  defined in `X` → needs `public meta import X`.

The alternative — dropping `module` for the `#eval`-bearing file —
works (non-`module` files can `import` `module` files freely) but
breaks the project's uniform module convention.

## 24. Restating a subterm in a standalone `have` can fail (`Function expected`) where the goal type-checks

When a goal contains a subterm like
`Pi.single (j e) v c x * (m x).ofLp c` (a `Pi.single`-indexed family
applied at `c` then `x`), restating that **same** subterm inside a
fresh `have`/`suffices` can fail with *"Function expected at
`Pi.single …`"* or *"Application type mismatch"* — even though the
goal itself elaborates fine.

The cause: in the goal, the implicit motive of `Pi.single` (the
family type `Fin d → (α → ℝ)`) is **pinned** by the surrounding lemma
that produced the term (here `blockPairing_apply`, whose statement
fixes `w : Fin d → α → ℝ`). Re-stating the subterm in isolation
strips that context, so the elaborator must re-infer the motive from
the literal expression and picks the wrong one (treating the
incidence row `α → ℝ` as the *value* rather than the *family member*).

**Fix:** don't restate — operate on the goal in place. Use
`rw [Finset.sum_congr rfl fun x _ => …]` or `simp only [...]` to
transform the sum directly, where the motive stays pinned by the
goal. Worked case: `BodyBarFramework.stdFramework_rigidityRow_eq` in
`BodyBar/TayTheorem.lean` — an attempted `have hinner : ∀ x, ∑ c,
Pi.single … = …` failed to elaborate; collapsing the inner
`Pi.single` sum via `rw [Finset.sum_eq_single …]` *on the goal*
worked. Sibling of §9 / §12 (the FunLike/PiLp "acts like a function
but isn't" family): same root cause — an elaborator inference that
the surrounding context was silently supplying.

## 25. `refine h.trans ?_` / `Iff.trans` requires a syntactic side-match, not just defeq

When a helper iff `h : A ↔ B` is meant to bridge a goal `A' ↔ C`
where `A'` is only *definitionally* equal to `A` (not syntactically),
`refine h.trans ?_` fails with a *"Type mismatch … has type `A ↔ ?` but
is expected to have type `A' ↔ …`"*. `Iff.trans` unifies its first
component against the goal's LHS up to reducible transparency only, so
the two must match *syntactically*; a `def`-unfolding or
binder-shape difference defeats it. Typical offenders:

- a wrapper-vs-base projection that is `rfl` but not syntactically
  equal: `F.IsIndependent D` vs `F.toBodyBar.IsIndependent D` (the
  former `def`-unfolds to the latter);
- a dependent existential `∃ (_ : p), q` vs a conjunction-style
  `p ∧ q` (both encode "`p` and `q`" but are different `Exists` /
  `And` head symbols).

**Fix:** don't compose with `.trans`. Open the goal iff with
`constructor` and discharge each direction with `exact`, which closes
up to full defeq — or, when one side already matches, `rw` the
matching iff and then `constructor`. Worked case:
`Graph.BodyHingeFramework.edgeMultiply_isSparse_iff` in
`BodyBar/BodyHinge.lean` — the body-hinge↔body-bar transport
(`exists_toBodyBar_iff`) only defeq-matches the goal's existential, so
the proof `rw`s `tay_witness`'s iff (a syntactic match on the
`IsSparse` side) and bridges the existentials with `constructor` +
`.mpr`, never `.trans`.

**Same rule for `rw` of a `map_eq_zero_iff`-family lemma when the
codomain is a `def`-wrapper.** `rw [map_eq_zero_iff _ e.injective]` (or
`LinearEquiv.map_eq_zero_iff`) pattern-matches `?f ?x = 0`
*syntactically*; if the equiv's codomain is a defeq abbrev (e.g.
`ScrewSpace k` for `⋀^(k+2−2) (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)`), the displayed
`(e ⋯) x` elaborated through that defeq and the `rw` reports *"Did not
find an occurrence of the pattern"*. Apply the lemma as a **term**
instead: `exact map_ne_zero_iff _ e.injective` (after `rw`-ing the goal
into the `e x ≠ 0 ↔ x ≠ 0` shape), since `exact` unifies up to defeq.
Worked case: `panelSupportExtensor_ne_zero_iff` in
`Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/`.

## 26. `simp [← lemma]` stalls on a `Submodule`/subtype carrier over a `RingQuot`-built algebra

When a carrier is a `Submodule` or subtype *over an algebra built by
`RingQuot`* — the canonical case is a graded piece `↥(⋀[ℝ]^k M)` of an
`ExteriorAlgebra`, but any `RingQuot`-quotient algebra qualifies — its
`Sub` / `SMul` / `Add` instances are inherited through the quotient
and the **module system keeps them sealed**. A rewrite that has to
*see* the operation in order to fold it, e.g.
`simp [← smul_sub]` turning `c • S u - c • S v` into `c • (S u - S v)`,
then silently fails to fire, and the build prints:

```
definitions were not unfolded because their definition is not exposed:
RingQuot.instSub
```

(or `RingQuot.instSMul`, `RingQuot.instAdd`, … depending on the op).

**Fix:** don't drive the rewrite through `simp [← …]`. Build the
target membership directly and `rw` the relevant
`AddCommGroup` / `Module` identity *onto the named hypothesis* in the
forward direction, where no unfolding of the sealed op is needed:

```lean
-- instead of: simpa [Pi.smul_apply, ← smul_sub] using Submodule.smul_mem _ c h
have := Submodule.smul_mem (ℝ ∙ F.supportExtensor e) c h
rwa [smul_sub] at this
```

## 27. `rw [deleteEdges]` (or any mathlib-`Graph` op defined via `.copy`) trips the motive — use the simps lemmas

Mathlib's `Graph.deleteEdges` is defined as a `.copy` of a `restrict`
(so the edge set is *definitionally* `E(G) \ F`):
`(G.restrict (E(G) \ F)).copy (edgeSet := E(G) \ F) (IsLink := …) …`.
Unfolding it with `rw [deleteEdges]` (or `rw [IsLink, deleteEdges, …]`)
exposes the `.copy` wrapper and `rewrite` then fails with *"motive is
not type correct"* / *"Did not find an occurrence of the pattern
`(?G ↾ ?E₀).IsLink …`"*, because the goal now carries the `.copy`
proof obligations (`deleteEdges._proof_2 …`) that abstract badly.

**Fix:** never `rw` the `def` itself. `deleteEdges` is `@[simps!]`
(with `grind =`), so the right tools are its **generated simp lemmas**,
which `simp only` applies cleanly through the `.copy`:

- `vertexSet_deleteEdges` — `V(G.deleteEdges F) = V(G)`;
- `deleteEdges_isLink` — `(G.deleteEdges F).IsLink e x y ↔ G.IsLink e x y ∧ e ∉ F`;
- `edgeSet_deleteEdges` — `E(G.deleteEdges F) = E(G) \ F`;
- `deleteEdges_inc`, `deleteEdges_isLoopAt`, …

Worked case: `Graph.mulTilde_splitOff_deleteFiber_le` in
`Molecular/Induction/` proves
`((G.splitOff …).mulTilde n).deleteEdges (edgeFiber e₀ n) ≤ G.mulTilde n`
by `refine ⟨?_, ?_⟩` then `simp only [vertexSet_deleteEdges] at hx` /
`simp only [deleteEdges_isLink, …] at hp` — `rw [deleteEdges]` had
tripped both subgoals on the `.copy` motive. The same applies to any
mathlib-`Graph` operation built with `.copy` (it's the standard idiom
there for pinning a definitional edge set); reach for the `simps`
lemmas, not the `def`.

Generic congruence-layer rewrites that don't depend on seeing the
operation unfolded — e.g. `add_sub_add_comm`, a plain `AddCommGroup`
rewrite applied at the congruence layer — **do** still fire under
`simp`, so a sibling `add_mem'` can keep `simpa [add_sub_add_comm]`.
The distinction is whether the rewrite needs to *unfold* the subtype's
sealed op (`← smul_sub` does: it must recognize `c • _ - c • _`) or
only rewrite *around* it (`add_sub_add_comm` does not).

Worked case: `infinitesimalMotions.smul_mem'` / `add_mem'` in
`Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean`, after Phase 18 refactored
`ScrewSpace` to the degree-`k` graded piece `↥(⋀[ℝ]^k (Fin (k+2) → ℝ))`.

## 28. `rw [if_pos rfl]` fails on a `(fun i ↦ if i = j then …) j` goal — use `simp only [↓reduceIte]`

**Symptom.** After `refine ⟨fun i => if i = j then … else …, …⟩` and a
`subst`/`by_cases` landing in the `i = j` branch, the goal still shows the
un-beta-reduced application `(fun i ↦ if i = j then A else B) j`. `rw [if_pos
rfl]` reports *"Did not find an occurrence of the pattern"* — the `if` is
hidden under an unapplied lambda, so there is no `ite` subterm at the syntactic
surface for `rw` to match.

**Fix.** `simp only [↓reduceIte]` does both the beta-reduction *and* the
`if (j = j)` → `then`-branch reduction in one step (the `↓reduceIte` simproc
fires after `simp`'s built-in beta). Plain `simp only [if_pos rfl]` also works
but flags `if_pos` as an *unused* simp argument (the simproc did the reduction,
not the lemma) — a `linter.unusedSimpArgs` warning. So reach for the simproc
name `↓reduceIte`, not the lemma. The `else`-branch (`i ≠ j`) is unaffected:
`simp only [if_neg hij]` fires there normally because the discriminant is a
free `hij : ¬ i = j`, no beta-redex in the way.

Worked case: `Graph.exists_packing_move_of_not_inc` in
`Molecular/Induction/` (the forest-packing rebalancing move, where the
re-chosen packing `fun i => if i = j then insert x (Fs j) else Fs i \ {x}` is
evaluated at `j` in the recipient-forest subgoals).

## 29. Cycle-lift by edge-substitution: the walk-rewiring idiom + four naming/`def`-unfold traps

**Symptom.** Proving "an inserted edge cannot create a cycle" by lifting a
hypothetical cycle of the *larger* graph back to a forbidden cycle of the
*smaller* one — rotate the cycle to put the new edge first, destructure off the
`cons`, splice the new edge out and a substitute walk in, then extract a
contained cycle. Four traps surface as build failures along the way.

**The idiom (vendored `apnelson1/Matroid` `WList`/`Graph.Walk` API).**
1. `WList.exists_rotate_firstEdge_eq (w := C) (e := r) hrC` — rotate `C` so the
   target edge `r` is first; gives `m`, nonempty-after-rotate, and the
   firstEdge equation.
2. `(hne.rotate m); WList.nonempty_iff_exists_cons.mp` — destructure
   `C.rotate m = cons x r w'`.
3. Re-derive the rotated walk's properties via `WList.rotate_edgeSet` (edge set
   is rotation-invariant) and `IsCyclicWalk.rotate` / `.isClosed` / `.edge_nodup`.
4. Build the substitute closed trail (`cons a pa (cons v pb w')`) as an
   `IsTour`, then `IsTour.exists_isCyclicWalk` returns a cycle `C'` with
   `C'.IsSublist T` — its edges are a subset of `T`'s by `WList.IsSublist.edge_subset`.

**The four traps.**
1. The "walk lives in the deleted-edges subgraph" iff is
   `Graph.isWalk_deleteEdges_iff` (`(G ＼ F).IsWalk w ↔ G.IsWalk w ∧ Disjoint E(w) F`),
   `Graph.`-namespaced. `WList.deleteEdges_isWalk_iff` is an *unknown constant*.
2. Sublist edge-containment is `WList.IsSublist.edge_subset : E(w₁) ⊆ E(w₂)`,
   **not** `…edgeSet_subset`.
3. `WList.IsClosed` is a bare `def` (`w.first = w.last`); `simp` reports "made
   no progress". Peel it with `WList.cons_isClosed_iff`
   (`(cons x e w).IsClosed ↔ x = w.last`) + `WList.last_cons`, then close by
   `hx ▸ hclosed` from the original cycle's closure.
4. Membership `p ∈ (cons x e w').edgeSet` from a list membership `p ∈ w'.edge`
   uses `WList.cons_edgeSet` (`E(cons x e w) = insert e E(w)`) +
   `Set.mem_insert_of_mem` + `WList.mem_edgeSet_iff`. `WList.cons_edge` is the
   *list* `.edge`, not the `Set`-valued `.edgeSet`, so `rw [cons_edge]` fails on
   an `edgeSet` goal.

**Orientation note.** When the inner `cons_isWalk_iff` link goal is
`K.IsLink pb v w'.first` and you have `hpb : K.IsLink pb v b`, `hwb : w'.first = b`,
write `hwb ▸ hpb` (no `.symm` — the `▸` rewrite already lands the direction);
only the *outer* link `K.IsLink pa a v` from `hpa : K.IsLink pa v a` needs `hpa.symm`.

Worked case: `Graph.isAcyclicSet_splitOff_reroute` in `Molecular/Induction/`
(Phase 20 forest-surgery `dᶠ(v)=2` reroute, substituting the short-circuit edge
by its `v`-traversing 2-path). Companion to the explicit-cyclic-walk tower in
`isCycleSet_pair_edgeFiber_splitOff` (FRICTION "Building a small explicit cyclic
walk").

## 30. `LinearMap.proj i - LinearMap.proj j` over a Pi type leaves the fiber/`R` stuck

**Symptom.** A definition like
```
def screwDiff (u v : α) : (α → W) →ₗ[ℝ] W := LinearMap.proj u - LinearMap.proj v
```
fails to elaborate with *"typeclass instance problem is stuck, it is often due to
metavariables: `(i : α) → Module ?m (?φ i)`"*, even though the declared type pins
both the domain `α → W` and codomain `W`. The `-` (over the `LinearMap` module)
unifies the two `proj` summands' types with each other *before* either is unified
against the declared codomain, so the Pi fiber family `?φ` and the scalar `?R`
stay metavariables and the `Module` instance can't be synthesized.

**Fix.** Type-ascribe the *first* summand to the full `LinearMap` type; the second
then unifies against it:
```
def screwDiff (u v : α) : (α → W) →ₗ[ℝ] W :=
  (LinearMap.proj u : (α → W) →ₗ[ℝ] W) - LinearMap.proj v
```
`(R := ℝ)` on each `proj` alone is *not* enough — it pins the scalar but leaves the
fiber family `?φ` stuck; the whole-LinearMap ascription is what fixes `?φ`. The
companion `_apply` lemma is then not `rfl` (the `proj` subtraction doesn't reduce
to the projection form under a `public section`): close it with
`rw [LinearMap.sub_apply, LinearMap.proj_apply, LinearMap.proj_apply]`.

Worked case: `BodyHingeFramework.screwDiff` in `Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean`
(Phase 21b, the relative-screw evaluation `S ↦ S u - S v` underlying the
rigidity-matrix row functionals).

## 31. Unascribed `∀ t, … t • x …` binder leaves the `•` scalar type a metavariable

**Symptom.** A statement of the form
```
theorem foo … : ∀ t, P = (… (fun i => a i + t • (0 : W)) …) := …
```
fails with *"typeclass instance problem is stuck: `HSMul ?m W W` … the first
type argument to `HSMul` is a metavariable"* at the `t • …` position. The
`∀ t,` binder gives `t` no type annotation, and nothing else in the body forces
it (here `t • (0 : W)` with `W` fixed pins the *result* type but not the
*scalar* type `?m`), so `t`'s type is undetermined when the `HSMul` instance is
sought. Same trap fires for any `∀ x, … x • _ …` / `∀ x, f x _` where the
binder's type is only weakly constrained by the body.

**Fix.** Ascribe the binder: `∀ t : ℝ, …`. The single annotation propagates and
the `HSMul ℝ W W` instance resolves. (Distinct from § 30: there the *fiber/scalar
of a `LinearMap` subtraction* was stuck; here it's the *bound variable's own type*
that's free.)

Worked case: `hcoord_const` in `Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/` (Phase 21b,
the constant-affine-path `hcoord` discharge; the `t • (0 : Module.Dual …)` term
needed `∀ t : ℝ`).

## 32. `ext x` on an equation of `Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)` (a functional on an exterior power) descends too far

**Symptom.** Proving an equation of `Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)` functionals —
e.g. `∑ i, c i • r i = 0` where `r i : Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)` — by `ext x`
binds `x : Fin k → Fin (k + 2) → ℝ` (the *generating-vector tuple* of the
exterior power) instead of the intended `x : ScrewSpace k`, and the goal becomes
a `LinearMap.compAlternatingMap … (exteriorPower.ιMulti ℝ k) x = …` between
`AlternatingMap`s. A later `… x` / `congrFun … x` then errors with *"Application
type mismatch: x has type `Fin k → Fin (k+2) → ℝ` but is expected to have type
`ScrewSpace k`"*. Cause: `ScrewSpace k = ↥(⋀[ℝ]^k …)`, so `Module.Dual ℝ
(ScrewSpace k) = ScrewSpace k →ₗ[ℝ] ℝ`, and the generic `ext` picks the
exterior-power `AlternatingMap` ext lemma (which peels through `ιMulti` to the
tuple of generators) over plain `LinearMap.ext`.

**Fix.** Don't use the `ext` *tactic*; apply `LinearMap.ext` explicitly so the
introduced point has type `ScrewSpace k`:
```
have hk : (∑ i, c i • r i : Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)) = 0 :=
  LinearMap.ext fun x => by simpa [LinearMap.sum_apply, LinearMap.smul_apply] using hval x
```
Relatedly, apply such a functional equation to a screw with `LinearMap.congr_fun
h x` rather than `congrFun (congrArg DFunLike.coe h) x` — the latter routes the
RHS `0` through the universe-polymorphic `DFunLike.coe` and fails with *"numerals
are data … the expected type is universe polymorphic and may be a proposition"*.

Worked case: `linearIndependent_hingeRow_star` in `Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean`
(Phase 21b, the cross-hinge star independence — both the `LinearMap.ext` collapse
of the per-hinge combination and the `LinearMap.congr_fun hg (update 0 (w j₀) x)`
evaluation).

## 33. `rw [hsub]` over a `Submodule` equation under `finrank ℝ ↥(…)` trips the motive — flip the equation and rewrite the *hypothesis*

**Symptom.** A `Submodule`-valued equation `hsub : A = B` (e.g. `(F p).infinitesimalMotions =
(span (range (g p))).dualCoannihilator`), and a goal of the form `… finrank ℝ ↥A … ≤ …`. Rewriting
the goal with `rw [hsub]` fails with *"Tactic `rewrite` failed: motive is not type correct"*. Cause:
the submodule `A` sits under the `↥`-coercion-to-type inside `Module.finrank ℝ`, so the rewrite
motive `fun S => Module.finrank ℝ ↥S ≤ …` carries a dependent coercion `↥S` and is not type-correct
in general (same family as § 18/20/27 — `rw` motive traps over dependent positions).

**Fix.** When the matching fact lives in a *hypothesis* `hp : … finrank ℝ ↥B … ≤ …` (a `≤`-Prop,
not a position under a fresh motive), rewrite the hypothesis with the **reversed** equation and
close by `exact`:
```
rw […, ← hsub] at hp   -- turns `↥B` in `hp` into `↥A`, matching the goal
exact hp
```
Rewriting `at hp` rather than on the goal sidesteps the motive type-correctness check (the
hypothesis's type is just a `Prop`). The general rescue axis: *if `rw [eq]` on the goal trips the
motive but the same content is already in a hypothesis, flip `eq` and rewrite the hypothesis
instead.*

Worked case: `exists_good_realization` in `Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/` (Phase 21b, the
multivariate genericity device — `rw [finrank_screwAssignment, ← hcoord p] at hp`).

## 34. `map_sum` won't push `Basis.repr` (a `LinearEquiv` to `Finsupp`) through a `∑` — route the coordinate through `Finsupp.lapply t ∘ₗ repr.toLinearMap`

**Symptom.** A goal carrying `b.repr (∑ i ∈ s, f i) t` (a single `⋀`-power / module basis coordinate
of a `Finset.sum`), and `rw [map_sum]` (or `simp only [map_sum]`, `conv` focused on the subterm)
reports *"Did not find an occurrence of the pattern `?g (∑ x ∈ ?s, ?f x)`"* even though `b.repr (∑…)`
is visibly a morphism applied to a sum. Forcing the morphism explicitly
(`rw [map_sum (b.repr)]`) instead fails with *"failed to synthesize `AddMonoidHomClass (M ≃ₗ[R] (ι →₀ R)) ?m ?m`"* /
`(deterministic) timeout at typeclass`. Cause: the codomain of `Basis.repr` is `Finsupp` (`ι →₀ R`),
and the `AddMonoidHomClass` instance for the bundled `M ≃ₗ[R] (ι →₀ R)` (needed for `map_sum` to fire)
does not synthesize — so `map_sum` silently won't unify `?g := b.repr`. The same snag blocks the
`.toLinearMap` form `M →ₗ[R] (ι →₀ R)`.

**Fix.** Don't push `repr` through the sum at all. The coordinate you actually want is the *`R`-valued*
linear functional `Finsupp.lapply t ∘ₗ b.repr.toLinearMap` (codomain `R`, whose `map_sum` synthesizes
fine). When the sum's terms are themselves a *linear* image (here `complementIso (c i • bs i)`),
fold the outer linear maps into one composite and rewrite the whole coordinate to that composite by a
`show … = (… ∘ₗ … ∘ₗ …) (∑ …) from rfl`, then `map_sum` fires:
```
rw [show b.repr (L (∑ i, c i • bs i)) t
      = (Finsupp.lapply t ∘ₗ b.repr.toLinearMap ∘ₗ L.toLinearMap) (∑ i, c i • bs i) from rfl,
  map_sum]
refine Finset.sum_congr rfl fun i _ => ?_
rw […, map_smul, smul_eq_mul, LinearMap.comp_apply, Finsupp.lapply_apply, LinearMap.comp_apply, …]
```
The `show … from rfl` holds because `Finsupp.lapply t (g x) = (g x) t` definitionally; routing through
the `ℝ`-codomain composite is the whole trick. (`Finsupp.lapply` is `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Finsupp`.)
General axis: *a `map_sum` / `map_smul` that silently won't match a `Basis.repr`-of-a-sum is the
`Finsupp`-codomain `AddMonoidHomClass` synthesis failing — compose with `Finsupp.lapply t` to drop the
codomain to the scalar ring first.*

Worked case: `panelSupportPoly_eval` in `Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/` (Phase 21b B0,
the panel-support-extensor coordinate-as-`MvPolynomial`).

## 35. Dot notation `g.foo` resolves `foo` against the type head's *root* namespace, not a file-local re-namespace

**Symptom.** A lemma written `theorem Graph.foo …` while the file sits inside an enclosing namespace
(e.g. `CombinatorialRigidity.Molecular`) lands at the full name
`CombinatorialRigidity.Molecular.Graph.foo`. A later call `g.foo` on `g : Graph α β` then fails with
*"Invalid field `foo`: the environment does not contain `Graph.foo`"* — even though `Graph.foo`
*resolves as an identifier* (the enclosing namespace is open). Dot/projection notation does **not**
use the open-namespace search: it looks for `foo` in the *structure head's own root namespace*
(mathlib's `Graph`), and the file-local `…Molecular.Graph.foo` is a different namespace, so the
projection is not found.

**Fix.** Either (a) call it by the (partially-qualified) identifier `Graph.foo g` instead of the
projection `g.foo` — the open namespace resolves it; or (b) define the lemma *inside* an explicit
`namespace Graph … end Graph` block so it really lands in the root `Graph` namespace and dot notation
finds it (this is what `Molecular/Induction/` does, so e.g. `Graph.rigidContract_isMinimalKDof`
*is* dot-callable). Cheap tell: if `g.foo` errors but `Graph.foo g` type-checks in the same file, you
hit this — the lemma is re-namespaced. General axis: *dot notation keys off the value's type-head root
namespace; a `T.foo` lemma authored outside a `namespace T` block is reachable by name but not by
projection.*

Worked case: `case_I_realization` in `Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/` (Phase 22a, N6-G3-G3c-iii-b)
— first hit while drafting a `Graph.exists_ends_of_graph` helper (later dropped in favour of the
pre-existing `Graph.endsOf`, which *is* in a `namespace Graph` block).

**Variant — the value's *type* is a `def : Prop` that unfolds to `Exists`.** Same axis, the other
common trigger. A hypothesis `h : HasGenericFullRankRealization k n G` (a `def … : Prop` whose body
is `∃ Q, …`) has type-head `Exists`, **not** `PanelHingeFramework`, so `h.some_pkg_lemma` tries to
project `Exists.some_pkg_lemma` and errors *"does not contain `Exists.some_pkg_lemma`"* — even when
`PanelHingeFramework.some_pkg_lemma` takes the `∃`-bundle positionally and is perfectly applicable.
**Fix:** call the lemma by its qualified name with the `∃`-hypothesis as a positional argument
(`PanelHingeFramework.finrank_span_rigidityRows_ofNormals_relabel_eq Gc f ends h hends`), not by
projection (`h.finrank_…`). Tell: the error names `Exists.<field>` rather than your type. Worked
case: the L5b-i completion `exists_rankPolynomial_of_IH_relabel_linking` calling the shared core
(Phase 22i).

**Variant — a `def : Prop` wrapping *another* `def : Prop` that unfolds to `Eq`, two levels
down.** Same axis again, but the error names `Eq.<field>` instead of `Exists.<field>`: `hf :
G.shadowGraph.IsTightPartition 3 f` (itself `G.partitionDef 3 f = G.deficiency n`, a bare `Eq`)
resolved from `G.shadowGraph.exists_isTightPartition 3`, then used where the surrounding proof
wants the *wrapper* `G.IsSquareTightPartition f := G.shadowGraph.IsTightPartition 3 f`. Dot calls
meant for `IsSquareTightPartition.foo` (e.g. `hf.sum_perPart_le`) fail with *"Invalid field
`sum_perPart_le`: the environment does not contain `Eq.sum_perPart_le`"* — elaboration unfolds
straight past both wrapper layers to the ultimate `Eq` head, since it never finds a match at
either intermediate namespace. **Fix, cheaper than requalifying every call:** re-ascribe the
*wrapper*'s type once via a `have`, then dot-call off that: `have hf : G.IsSquareTightPartition f
:= hf0` — every subsequent `hf.foo` now resolves against `IsSquareTightPartition`'s namespace
first (this also fixes `.symm` and similar `Eq`-level dot calls, which still work by falling
through the same unfold chain). Worked case: `laman_square_count`'s tight-partition setup
(JacobsCounting.lean, Phase 32).

## 36. Matching a value indexed by a *derived* cardinality (`m + n`, a `disjUnion`) against one at a *literal* cardinality

**Symptom.** A lemma output is indexed at a glued cardinality — e.g.
`ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti_family_mul_of_disjoint` returns an `ιMulti_family` at `m + n`
(`Set.powersetCard I (m + n)`, the `disjUnion` index) — and you must match it against the same
construction at a *literal* cardinality `N` (here the top basis vector at `N = k + 2`). The two
cardinalities are `omega`-equal but not syntactically; the index lives in a *cardinality-dependent
type* (`Set.powersetCard I m`). A direct `rw [Nat.add_sub_cancel' …]` or `congr!` fails with
*"motive is not type correct"* / *"typeclass … `Subsingleton ?m` stuck"*, because the term has
*several* sub-terms carrying the exponent (`disjUnion`, `permOfDisjoint`, the `repr` basis), and the
rewrite can't abstract them coherently.

**Fix.** Do **not** rewrite the `Nat`-equality in place. Package a small helper lemma that takes the
cardinality equality as a **`subst`-able hypothesis** `(hmn : m = n)` (a *bare local variable* on one
side, so `subst hmn` actually fires and erases the cast), plus a *data* side-goal — the underlying
finsets are equal, `(↑s : Finset I) = ↑t` — discharged by `Subtype.ext`. Once `subst hmn` runs, both
indices live in the same `Set.powersetCard I n` and the data equality closes it. General axis: *a
dependent cardinality cast is tractable only after `subst`; make a helper whose hypothesis is the raw
`m = n` so `subst` is available, rather than fighting `rw`/`congr!` on the glued term.*

Worked case (historical; the caller was deleted Phase 30 RELAX slice (e), `notes/Phase30.md`, once
its own sole consumer — KT's footnote-6 rationality bridge — was retired): the deleted
`wedgePairing_ιMulti_family_mem_range_intCast` (Phase 22d, `Molecular/Meet.lean`) matched the
diagonal pairing value `screwAlgebraTopEquiv (e_S ∨ₑ e_Sᶜ)` this way; the helper it used, the
mirrored `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti_family_congr` (FRICTION *[mirrored]*,
`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/ExteriorPower/Basis.lean`), survives as a general-purpose upstream
candidate.

## 37. `Nonempty (α ↪ β)` from a cardinality bound across *different universes* — use `Cardinal.lift_mk_le'`, not `le_def`

**Symptom.** You have `α` finite (or `#α ≤ #β`) and want an embedding `Nonempty (α ↪ β)`, and reach
for `Cardinal.le_def (α β) : #α ≤ #β ↔ Nonempty (α ↪ β)`. The `rw [← Cardinal.le_def]` fails with
*"Did not find an occurrence of the pattern `Nonempty (Function.Embedding.{?u+1, ?u+1} ?α ?β)`"* —
because `le_def` requires `α β : Type u` in the **same** universe, but here `α : Type u_1` and
`β : Type` (e.g. `β = ι` the index of a transcendence basis, which mathlib hands you in `Type 0`).

**Fix.** Use the cross-universe form `Cardinal.lift_mk_le' : lift.{v} #α ≤ lift.{u} #β ↔ Nonempty
(α ↪ β)` (`{α : Type u} {β : Type v}`). `rw [← Cardinal.lift_mk_le']` then leaves a goal on lifted
cardinals; close it with the `lift`-flavored cardinal lemmas (`Cardinal.lift_lt_aleph0`,
`Cardinal.aleph0_le_lift`) rather than the un-lifted ones. General axis: *any cardinal comparison
whose two sides live in different universes needs the `lift_*` companion lemma; the bare form is
same-universe only.*

Worked case: `exists_injective_algebraicIndependent_real` (Phase 22d,
`Mathlib/RingTheory/AlgebraicIndependent/TranscendenceBasis.lean`) — embedding a finite `σ` into the
infinite transcendence-basis index `ι : Type` of ℝ over ℚ.

## 38. Unfolding a basis/dual-coordinate iso `φ` *in place* over a heavy `Module.Dual`/exterior-power type `whnf`-times-out — extract a generic helper over an abstract basis

**Symptom.** A proof step computes a coordinate or matrix entry of a linear map through a
basis-coordinate iso `φ : W ≃ₗ[R] (Fin n → ℝ)` built from a *concrete, heavy* `W` (e.g.
`Module.Dual ℝ (α → ScrewSpace k)`, an exterior-power dual), say
`φ (f.dualMap (φ⁻¹ (Pi.single l 1))) j`. Unfolding `φ` (`dualBasis_equivFun`, `funCongrLeft_apply`,
`dualMap_apply`, …) *in place* inside a large proof context hits *"(deterministic) timeout at
`whnf`"* or *"at `isDefEq`, maximum number of heartbeats"* — the elaborator keeps reducing the heavy
carrier type.

**Fix.** Lift the coordinate/matrix-entry computation into a **standalone (`private`) lemma stated
over an abstract `b : Basis ι R W`** (and `e : Fin n ≃ ι`, `f : W →ₗ[R] W`), with `φ` written
`b.dualBasis.equivFun.trans (LinearEquiv.funCongrLeft R R e)`. Proven against the *abstract* basis it
elaborates in isolation with no `whnf` on the concrete type; the call site then `rw`s in its
concrete `φ`/`f` and is left with a lightweight goal (e.g. `b.dualBasis (e l) (f (b (e j)))`, a
Kronecker `0`/`1` for a projection `f`). This is the same medicine as § 32's
`coord_linearMap_eq_matrix_mulVec` and the *basis-coercion `map'`* FRICTION entry: **the abstract
restatement is the rescue, not a `set_option maxHeartbeats` bump.** Note `Basis.equivFun`/`dualBasis`
need `[Finite ι] [DecidableEq ι]` in the lemma *statement* (`haveI := Fintype.ofFinite ι` in the
proof, else the `unusedFintypeInType` linter fires on a `[Fintype ι]` binder).

Worked case (historical; deleted Phase 30 RELAX slice (e), `notes/Phase30.md`, once the projected
rank polynomial's rationality conjunct it fed was dropped): `dualMap_matrix_entry_eq` (Phase 22d,
`Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/CaseI.lean`) — the `extProj`-dual-map matrix entry (FRICTION
*the `extProj`-dual-map matrix entry … is rational*). `coord_linearMap_eq_matrix_mulVec`
(same file) is the surviving sibling built the same way, still live.

**Call-site variant (Phase 22g).** The same `whnf`/`isDefEq` timeout fires not only on an *in-place*
unfold but when an `exact helper _ …` leaves a **heavy-carrier-typed argument implicit** and the
elaborator must *infer* it by unifying the helper's conclusion against the goal — the conclusion
mentions the heavy term (e.g. `omitTwoExtensor … (ne_of_lt q.2) = extensor …` over `⋀²ℝ⁴`), so
solving the metavariable reduces it. Fix: **pass the heavy-carrier argument as an explicit literal**
so the match is syntactic, not search. In `exists_hduality_witness_of_panel_incidence`
(`Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean`, the six-join `hduality` assembly) the join index `q` is the
offending implicit — `fin_cases q` then `exact hone ⟨(0,1), by decide⟩ … ` (explicit subtype
literal) elaborates instantly where the same call with `q := _` timed out. Corollary: prefer
`fin_cases q` on the subtype over `obtain ⟨⟨i,j⟩,hij⟩ := q` + `fin_cases i <;> fin_cases j` — the
latter leaves `hij : (fun i ↦ i) ⟨v,_⟩ < …` artifacts that block `omega` and forces a separate
`c, d` resolution.

**Membership-witness variant (Phase 22g).** The same timeout fires when a *membership* lemma
(`F.panelRow_mem_rigidityRows`, whose hypothesis is `F.graph.IsLink …` over a heavy `F =
(ofNormals G ends q).toBodyHinge`) is invoked at a `… ∈ F.rigidityRows` goal and the elaborator must
unify the supplied `G.IsLink …` against `F.graph.IsLink …` — even via `refine … ?_; change G.IsLink _
_ _` the `whnf` to reconcile `F.graph` with `G` blows up. Fix: don't call the membership lemma at all
— **inline the `rigidityRows` membership witness** as the anonymous constructor `⟨e, u, v, hlink, …,
rfl⟩` in a helper `have hrow_mem : ∀ i, G.IsLink i.1 … → F.panelRow ends i ∈ F.rigidityRows`, taking
the `G.IsLink` as an *explicit argument* (the witness is *supplied*, not an inferred goal, so the
defeq is checked cheaply). This is the form `hasGenericFullRankRealization_of_rigidOn_ofNormals` and
the green `case_I_realization` block (`Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/CaseI.lean`) both use.

**Row-family-argument variant (Phase 22h).** A span/rigidity lemma
(`isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_vertexSet_of_span_le_rigidityRows`) applied with its **row-family argument
built over a heavy carrier** — `(a := fun i : ↥s => Ft.panelRow ends i)` where `Ft =
caseIIICandidate G ends q …` — `whnf`-times-out even at `maxHeartbeats 4000000`, while every prior
`have` elaborates instantly (the explosion is *only* the lemma application, where the elaborator
processes the heavy `Ft.panelRow` while unifying the family and synthesizing its codomain instances).
Fix: **`set f := <heavy family> with hf` then `clear_value f`** right before the application, having
already discharged the family's `LinearIndependent`/span-containment hypotheses (they auto-fold onto
`f` under `set`). The lemma then applies to the opaque `f` with no carrier `whnf`. Pair with the §38
*membership-witness* idiom for the span-containment proof and apply the lemma at the *concrete*
carrier `(ofNormals G ends q₀).toBodyHinge` (not a `set`-bound abbrev — the `let`-indirection is what
the `clear_value` removes). Worked case: `case_III_arm_realization` (W7, the `d = 3` Case-III arm,
`Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/CaseI.lean`). As always: **the `set`/`clear_value` is the fix, not a
`maxHeartbeats` bump** (4M still timed out).

**`LinearIndependent.units_smul_iff` variant (Phase 34).** The same explosion recurs for `.mp`/
`.mpr` of a *unit-scaling* transport (`LinearIndependent.units_smul_iff v w`) between a heavy family
already produced (e.g. `F.panelRow ends`, `F := Q.toBodyHinge` a `def`, not an fvar) and a *second*
family built from a different `def`-application (`normalRow ends q`) — timing out even at
`maxHeartbeats 1600000` (170s wall-clock, real, not an LSP-only artifact — confirmed via `lake
build`), while every earlier `have` in the same proof elaborates fine. Fix is identical: `set v :=
<target family> with hv`, `set w := <sign weights> with hw`, prove the family-equality `have heq :
<heavy source family> = w • v` while `v`/`w`'s *values* are still available, `rw [heq] at hsli`, then
`clear_value v w` **immediately before** `(LinearIndependent.units_smul_iff v w).mp hsli` — the
`clear_value` must come after `heq` is proven (which needs the values) but strictly before the
`units_smul_iff` application (which must not see them). Worked case:
`PanelHingeFramework.exists_independent_normalRow_of_le_finrank` (Phase 34,
`Molecular/GenericLift/PanelGeneric.lean`). No `maxHeartbeats` bump needed once fixed — the whole
proof builds under the *default* 200000.

*Abstract-brick call-site sub-case (Phase 22j).* When the lemma is an **abstract span-transport
brick** taking the row families as *explicit named arguments* (`le_finrank_span_rigidityRows_of_
pinned_placement`, with `rn`/`ro` explicit), passing inline `fun i => FG.panelRow …` families still
`isDefEq`-times-out (6.4M), but **`set rn := …` / `set ro := …` alone fixes it — no `clear_value`
needed** (the explicit-named-arg position is matched against the opaque fvar syntactically, not
inferred, so the `let`-value never has to be reduced). Also state the brick result's `Nat.card … ≤
finrank …` type explicitly on the `have`. Worked case: `case_II_realization_all_k`'s `hrank_lb`
(Phase 22j S4, `Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/CaseI.lean`).

**`span_induction` variant (Phase 22h).** A `Submodule.span_induction` whose *conclusion* lives in a
heavy `Module.Dual ℝ (α → ScrewSpace k)` span and whose generator case dispatches on several
endpoint sub-cases (`by_cases x = a` / `y = a` / else) hits the *cumulative*-budget timeout (the
declaration-level *"timeout at `whnf`"* at the theorem's first line, plus a *"tactic execution"*
timeout starting in the second `by_cases` branch — the first branch starves the rest) when each
sub-case carries its own **chained big-carrier `rw`**. Two compounding fixes, both pure §38 medicine
(keep the heavy carrier out of repeated `rw`-motive abstraction):
- **Bundle the transport as one `LinearMap` `T`** (`set T := … with hT`) so the `span_induction`
  predicate is the *light* `T ψ ∈ span …`; the `zero`/`add`/`smul` cases then close by
  `map_zero`/`map_add`/`map_smul` + `Submodule.{zero,add,smul}_mem` with **no** restatement of the
  heavy difference term (restating it in a `have … = …` ascription re-incurs the whnf blowup).
- **Per generator sub-case, consolidate the post-substitution rewrites into a single `simp only
  [...]`** (one goal traversal) rather than a chain of `rw [a, b, c, …]` (N separate motive
  abstractions over the heavy term). Use plain `rw [hxa, hyc]` only for the cheap *variable*
  substitutions (`x → a`, etc. — they touch only the small endpoint args), then hand the heavy
  rewrite lemmas (`hingeRow_funLeft_dualMap`, `hingeRow_swap`, `hingeRow_comp_single_{tail,off}`,
  `← hingeRow_eq_dualMap`, `map_zero`) to one `simp only`. Avoid `subst h` on a hypothesis `h : x =
  c` whose RHS is a *lemma binder* variable (`{v a c : α}`) — `subst` eliminates the RHS `c`, making
  `c` "unknown identifier" downstream; `rw [h]` keeps it.
Worked case: `BodyHingeFramework.funLeft_dualMap_sub_acolumn_mem_span_rigidityRows` (W9a, the M₃
relabel transport, `Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/CaseI.lean`). **No `maxHeartbeats` bump** — the
whole Molecular subsystem carries zero overrides; the `T`-bundle + `simp only` keeps it under the
default 200000.

**Final-`∃`-witness-assembly variant (Phase 22k).** When a producer ends by *hand-assembling* the
existential motive (`HasGenericFullRankRealization`, a `def` unfolding to a 5-conjunct `∃ Q, …`) as
the anonymous constructor `⟨Q, …, hrank_eq, …⟩` over a heavy `Q = ofNormals G ends q` — plus the
`B2 ≤` + `le_antisymm` rank-equality and the `▸`/`set`-fold bookkeeping to make `hrank_eq` match the
motive's `Q.toBodyHinge.rigidityRows` — the *assembly itself* is the dominant `whnf` site: it
`whnf`s the heavy carrier to unify each conjunct against `Q`'s projections. It times out **even at 6M
heartbeats**, and extracting the *upstream* geometric blocks into helpers does **not** fix it (they
were never the bottleneck). Fix: **don't hand-assemble — route the witness through the existing
keystone lemma that takes the data as explicit arguments and builds the `∃` internally.** Here
`hasGenericFullRankRealization_of_rigidOn_ofNormals G ends hends hne hnev hrig n hdef` consumes a
plain "rigid on `V(G)` at the seed" fact (itself obtained from the combined row family via
`isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_vertexSet_of_span_le_rigidityRows`, no carrier defeq) and emits the motive
— turning a 6M-heartbeat `whnf` blowup into a 55s clean build at `maxHeartbeats 800000`. The general
lesson: an existence-motive producer should bottom out on a *consumer* lemma that takes the witness
data positionally, never on a bare `⟨…⟩` against the unfolded `def`. Worked case:
`PanelHingeFramework.case_I_realization_h65` (Phase 22k L8c-2, `Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/Theorem55.lean`).

**Relabel-brick implicit-seed/endpoint variant (Phase 23b).** When `refine`-ing a panel-hinge
relabel brick (`rigidityRow_relabel_to_block`, `…_to_genuine`, …) into a *disjunction* goal whose
target framework is a heavy `ofNormals (G.removeVertex …) endsσρ qρ` with `qρ := fun p => q (ρ p.1,
p.2)`, leaving the brick's **seed `{qρ}` and panel-endpoint `{a b}` implicit** makes the elaborator
solve them by higher-order unification of the brick conclusion's `panelSupportExtensor (qρ a) (qρ b)`
against the goal's concrete `C(q (ρ vₐ)) (q (ρ v_b))` — a *"(deterministic) timeout at `whnf`"* at
the `refine`'s lemma-name position (200k). Fix: **pass `(qρ := fun p => q (ρ p.1, p.2)) (a := …)
(b := …)` explicitly** so the match is syntactic; the timeout vanishes. Same medicine as the
call-site / row-family variants above (pin the heavy implicit), now for the seed-function + endpoint
slots. **Second lesson, brick rigidity:** the two-orientation block bricks (`…_to_block` `ρ':=r` /
`…_to_block_swap` `ρ':=−r`) demand a *literal* `hsupp : C(qρ a)(qρ b) = base.supportExtensor f`, which
cannot absorb a sign — and the recorded `ends₀ f` orientation is *independent* of the endpoint
classification order, so 2 of the 4 combinations have a `C(q x)(q y)` vs `C(q y)(q x) = −C(q x)(q y)`
mismatch the literal `hsupp` can't express. When the orientation axes are independent, **inline the
`±r` block construction** (`refine Or.inr ⟨±r, ?_, ?_⟩` + a single hoisted `hperp : r (C(q x)(q y)) =
0` from `mem_hingeRowBlock_iff` + `hrec` + `panelSupportExtensor_swap`/`map_neg`) rather than routing
through the rigid bricks. Worked case: `PanelHingeFramework.chainData_bottom_relabel` (CHAIN-2c-ii-arm
genuine-row `hwmem`, `Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/CaseIII/Relabel.lean`). No `maxHeartbeats` bump.

**Named submodule-basis coercion variant (Phase 23d).** `Basis.linearIndependent.map' W.subtype
(Submodule.ker_subtype _)` — to prove that a *specific* submodule basis `b : Basis ι ℝ ↥W`, coerced
into the ambient `(b i : V)`, is LI — `whnf`-times-out (200k) when `V` is the heavy `Module.Dual ℝ
(ScrewSpace k)`, and **none of the in-proof §38 medicines help**: `set b … clear_value`, the
`linearIndependent_iff'` finset-form, and `Subtype.ext`/`Submodule.coe_eq_zero` bridging each still
tip the budget, because the `whnf` is intrinsic to `.map'`'s instance unification with the *concrete
codomain* `V` (not a `let`-value the `clear_value` could hide, and not a single tactic). The
existence form `Submodule.exists_linearIndependent_fin_of_finrank_eq` is unusable when the consumer
needs the LI of the *named* family, not an arbitrary one. Fix: **factor the `.map'` into a
generic-over-`V` mirror lemma** — `Module.Basis.linearIndependent_coe_subtype` (in
`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Dimension/Constructions.lean`): the `.map'` step elaborates once against the
abstract `V`, and the call site applies it at the heavy carrier with the unification already
discharged. The named-family complement of `exists_linearIndependent_fin_of_finrank_eq`. Worked case:
`BodyHingeFramework.linearIndependent_blockBasisOn_screwDual` (dispatch leaf 3 within-block half,
`Molecular/RigidityMatrix/Concrete.lean`). No `maxHeartbeats` bump.

**Generic-mathlib-composite variant (Phase 34).** Composing two *fully generic* mathlib lemmas
(`Submodule.map_span` then `LinearEquiv.finrank_map_eq`) to show `finrank (span (f '' s)) = finrank
(span s)` for an equivalence `f` — via `rw [mapSupport_rigidityRows]; set T := f with hT; set S :=
span K s with hS; …; clear_value T S; exact LinearEquiv.finrank_map_eq T S` — still `whnf`-times out
(200k) **at the `set T := f with hT` line itself**, when `f`'s codomain is a heavy carrier like
`Module.Dual K (α → ScrewSpace K k)`: `set`'s type ascription re-elaborates the stated type from
scratch (re-deriving the `Module`/`AddCommGroup` instances), so the blowup happens independent of
where `f` is later *used* — no in-proof `set`/`clear_value` placement fixes it, because the
expensive step is forming the *named* term, not applying a lemma to it. A separate coercion
mismatch (`rw [← Submodule.map_span f s]` — the goal's `⇑f` is the equiv's own `FunLike` coe, not the
`⇑(f : V →ₗ[K] W)` coe the lemma is keyed on) independently causes `rw` to report *"did not find an
occurrence"* rather than a timeout, fixed the same way as `mapSupport_hingeRowBlock` above:
`rw [show span K (f '' s) = (span K s).map (f : V →ₗ[K] W) from (Submodule.map_span (f : V →ₗ[K]
W) s).symm]` (`show … from` uses `isDefEq`, not syntactic matching). Fix for **both** issues at once,
same medicine as the *named submodule-basis coercion variant* above: **factor the whole composite
into a `private` lemma stated over abstract `{V W : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module K V] …`**
(`finrank_span_image_eq_of_linearEquiv`), proven with the `show`-term coercion fix inside — the
abstract statement's `set`/`rw`/`exact` all elaborate against opaque `V`/`W` with no heavy-carrier
`whnf`; the call site (`exact finrank_span_image_eq_of_linearEquiv (dualBodyMap α M) F.rigidityRows`)
then just unifies `V W := Module.Dual K (α → ScrewSpace K k)` from `f`'s already-known concrete type,
which is cheap (a metavariable assignment, not a defeq search). No `maxHeartbeats` bump. Worked case:
`BodyHingeFramework.finrank_span_rigidityRows_mapSupport` (Phase 34,
`Molecular/GenericLift/HingeGeneric.lean`).

## 39. Rank-nullity on a linear map into/out of a `Submodule`/`Submodule.Quotient` over a heavy carrier `whnf`-times-out — run it on the *plain `Pi`* (un-restricted) map

**Symptom.** A rank-nullity step `LinearMap.finrank_range_add_finrank_ker g` (or
`g.quotKerEquivRange`, `Submodule.liftQ`, `(LinearMap.range g).finrank_le`, `Submodule.ker g` fed to
a `[AddCommGroup]`-requiring lemma) where `g`'s domain or codomain is a *`Submodule`* (e.g.
`↥(partitionConstant f)`) or a *`Submodule.Quotient`* (e.g. `(α → ScrewSpace k) ⧸ N`) over a heavy
carrier (`ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)`) hits *"(deterministic) timeout at `whnf`/`isDefEq`"* — even
at `maxHeartbeats 1600000`. `Submodule`/`Submodule.Quotient` each carry a `AddCommMonoid` instance
*separate* from their `AddCommGroup` (`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Quotient/Defs.lean` declares both, and
`Submodule` likewise); `LinearMap`/`mkQ` record the `AddCommMonoid`, while the rank-nullity lemma
wants `AddCommGroup.toAddCommMonoid`. The two are defeq but only via a `whnf` that recursively
reduces the heavy carrier — so the *normally trivial* monoid-vs-group reconciliation blows up.

**Fix.** Run the rank-nullity on the map whose **domain and codomain are plain `Pi` function
types** (`α → W`), never a `Submodule`/quotient. Concretely:
- keep the cut as a *full* map `α → ScrewSpace k →ₗ codomain` (don't `.comp …subtype`-restrict to a
  `Submodule` domain): `finrank_range_add_finrank_ker` on the `Pi` domain dodges the diamond;
- make the codomain a *single* `Submodule.pi` quotient (`(ι → W) ⧸ N`), **not** a pi of fiber
  quotients `∀ i, W ⧸ p i` — the single quotient is one `Submodule.Quotient` instance, light enough
  for `finrank_range_add_finrank_ker`; split it to the fiber-quotient product *only* for the finrank
  count, via `Submodule.quotientPi` + `Module.finrank_pi_fintype` (import
  `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Quotient.Pi`);
- recover the restricted statement (`finrank (partitionMotions = ker ⊓ W_f)`) with
  `Submodule.finrank_sup_add_finrank_inf_eq` + `(ker ⊔ W_f).finrank_le ≤ finrank (full Pi)` — all on
  `Submodule`s of the *Pi* type, no map-instance reconciliation.

This is the same medicine as § 38 (the heavy carrier must stay out of the elaborator's `whnf`), here
applied to instance-diamond reconciliation rather than a basis-coordinate unfold. **A
`maxHeartbeats` bump is not the fix — it still times out.** Worked case:
`BodyHingeFramework.screwDim_mul_numParts_sub_le_finrank_partitionMotions` (Phase 22d,
`Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/PanelLayer.lean`, the `hub` dimension lower bound).

## 40. Singleton-family LI (`LinearIndependent.of_subsingleton`) needs a torsion-free instance not transitively imported in module mode

**Symptom.** Proving `LinearIndependent K (fun _ : Unit => x)` (or any subsingleton-indexed
family) from `x ≠ 0` via `LinearIndependent.of_subsingleton (default) hx0` fails in a narrow-import
file with *"failed to synthesize `Module.IsTorsionFree K M`"* — even though `K` is a `DivisionRing`
/ `Field`, where the family obviously is independent. A full-mathlib scratch (`lean_run_code`,
`#eval`) masks the gap: it imports the instance transitively, so the same `exact` succeeds there and
only fails once dropped into the actual (mirror) file.

**Cause.** `LinearIndependent.of_subsingleton (i) (hi : v i ≠ 0)` is stated over
`[IsDomain R] [Module.IsTorsionFree R M]` (`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/LinearIndependent/Defs.lean`). For
a division-ring module the instance is `DivisionSemiring.to_moduleIsTorsionFree`, which lives in
`Mathlib.Algebra.Module.Torsion.Field` — **not** reachable from
`Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.LinearIndependent.Basic` + `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Span.Basic` alone.

**Fix.** Add `public import Mathlib.Algebra.Module.Torsion.Field` (the smallest carrier of the
instance). Alternatives that avoid the import but cost a line: `LinearIndependent.of_subsingleton'
(i) (fun r hr => (smul_eq_zero.1 hr).resolve_right hx0)` — the zero-ring-safe variant taking
`∀ r, r • v i = 0 → r = 0` directly, no torsion-free instance. **General rule:** when a mirror /
narrow-import file fails to synthesize an "obvious" algebraic instance (`IsTorsionFree`,
`NoZeroSMulDivisors`, …) that a full-mathlib scratch finds, the instance's *defining import* is
missing — add it, don't reach for `set_option`. Worked case: `linearIndependent_sumElim_unit_iff`
(Phase 22e N4, `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/LinearIndependent/Basic.lean`).

## 41. `rw [← f.sum_repr y]` (or any `rw [eq]` rewriting a *function* term) hits the function's partial applications too — target the side with `conv`

**Symptom.** Rewriting a function-valued term — e.g. `rw [← (Pi.basisFun R η).sum_repr y]` to expand
`y` in its basis — unexpectedly blows up the *other* side of the goal: a clean RHS `∑ i, x i * y i`
becomes `∑ i, x i * (∑ j, repr y j • basisFun j) i`, and the proof no longer closes. The rewrite was
meant to touch only the `y` sitting in `toDual x y`.

**Cause.** `rw [eq]` rewrites *every* occurrence of `eq`'s LHS as a *term*, and a bare function name
`y : η → R` is a term that also occurs inside each partial application `y i`. So `← sum_repr y`
matches the `y` in `y i` and rewrites it, not just the standalone `y` you had in mind.

**Fix.** Scope the rewrite to one side: `conv_lhs => rw [← (Pi.basisFun R η).sum_repr y]` (or
`conv_rhs`, `nth_rewrite k`). **General rule:** when an `rw` of an equation whose LHS is a
*function-valued* term over-rewrites, the unintended hits are its partial applications elsewhere in
the goal — narrow with `conv_lhs`/`conv_rhs`/`nth_rewrite` rather than re-stating the lemma. Worked
case: `Pi.basisFun_toDual_apply` (Phase 22g, `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Dual/Basis.lean`).

## 42. Proof-term mismatch between two `by tac` closures for the same proposition — use `let` in the theorem signature

**Symptom.** A helper lemma `h : P := by tac` is elaborated twice: once when declaring the helper's
type and once when using the result in a `congr`, `exact`, or `rw`. Lean treats the two `by tac`
closures as definitionally equal but *not* syntactically equal, so `exact normalsJoin_eq_ιMulti_family_pair h`
(where `h` was provided as an explicit argument `(h : i < j)`) fails or times out on a `congr`
motive that checks the proof of the `Finset.card_pair` subterm — even though the proposition is
the same. Concretely: `Finset.card_pair (Fin.ne_of_lt h01)` inside the helper's conclusion uses the
`h01` argument, while `Finset.card_pair (Fin.ne_of_lt h01')` at the call site uses a different
`h01'` proof object (same type, different elaboration closure), causing a definitional-equality
puzzle under a whnf-heavy context.

**Cause.** `by omega` (or any tactic proof) inside a term — e.g. as the membership proof in
`⟨{i, j}, Finset.card_pair (Fin.ne_of_lt h)⟩` — produces a closed proof term, but *two calls*
produce *two distinct closed terms* (the elaborator doesn't cache them across call sites). When the
helper's conclusion mentions `Finset.card_pair (Fin.ne_of_lt h)` and the caller passes a proof of
the same inequality obtained by a separate `by simp only [Fin.mk_lt_mk]; omega`, the two proof terms
differ and `exact` / `rw` trips on the motive.

**Fix.** Declare the inequality proofs as `let`-bound parameters in the helper's *statement*, not as
regular explicit arguments:

```lean
private theorem sorted_family_eq (hk : 1 ≤ k) :
    let h01 : ⟨0⟩ < (⟨1⟩ : Fin (k+2)) := by simp only [Fin.mk_lt_mk]; omega
    ...
    <conclusion referencing h01 in Finset.card_pair (Fin.ne_of_lt h01)> := by
  intro h01 ...
  exact helper h01
```

After `intro h01`, the `h01` in the *goal* is exactly the `let`-body — the same closed proof term
that appears in the `Finset.card_pair` subterm of the conclusion. Now `exact helper h01` can unify
because `h01` is literally the same term on both sides. The caller uses
`rw [sorted_family_eq hk]` and does not need to supply the inequality proofs at all. Worked case:
`basisFun3_normalsJoin_sorted_family` (Phase 22h, `PanelLayer.lean`); the alternative (explicit
`(h01 : ...)` argument) timed out in whnf due to a proof-term mismatch under a `fin_cases` context.

## 43. `set X := e with hX` folds `e` in *pre-existing* hypotheses — a later `rw [h]` whose LHS was `e` then finds nothing

**Symptom.** *"Tactic `rewrite` failed: Did not find an occurrence of the pattern"* on a
`rw [h]` (or `rw [h₁, h₂, …]`) where `h : e = …` came from an earlier `obtain`/`have`, and a
`set X := e with hX` ran *between* obtaining `h` and the failing `rw`.

**Cause.** `set X := e with hX` rewrites *every existing occurrence* of `e` — in the goal **and in
all hypotheses already in context** — to the new local `X`. So a hypothesis `h : e = rhs` obtained
before the `set` silently becomes `h : X = rhs`. A later `rw [h]` (intending to rewrite the syntactic
`e`) now rewrites `X`; if the target still shows `e` (e.g. just produced by another rewrite), the
pattern `X` is absent and the `rw` fails — or, dually, `rw [h]` over-fires on an unexpected `X`.
(Worked case: Phase 22h W6b, `CaseI.lean` — `set Eb := Submodule.span ℝ (Set.range r)` folded W5's
`hrspan : span (range r) = …` into `hrspan : Eb = …`, so the subsequent `rw [hEb, hrspan]` chain
could not find `span (range r)`.) **Goal-side / library-lemma variant (same mechanism):** the fold
also hides `e` *in the goal*, so a later `rw`/`simp only [lib_lemma]` whose LHS *pattern* mentions
`e` (not your local `hX`) silently fails to fire — `simp only` reports its args "unused" rather than
erroring. (Phase 23b CHAIN-3 OD-8: `set b := Pi.basisFun ℝ (Fin (d+1))` folded the goal to
`(b.exteriorPower n).toDual …`, so the library rewrite `exteriorPower_basis_toDual_eq_pairingDual_comp_map_grade`
— LHS `(Pi.basisFun …).exteriorPower n).toDual` — never matched; dropping the `set` and writing
`Pi.basisFun` explicitly fixed it.)

**Fix.** Track that the `set` already rewrote your old hypotheses, and drop the now-redundant
`rw [hX]` / `rw [h]` step. Two reliable shapes:
- **Lean on the fold:** since `set X := e` made `h : X = rhs`, write the downstream chain *against
  `X`* directly — `rw [h]` now rewrites `X → rhs` exactly where you want it, no `rw [hX]` first.
- **Decouple a derived form:** introduce `hX' : X = <other form> := by rw [h, …]` right after the
  `set`, then use `hX'`. This pins the post-fold identity once instead of re-deriving it in each
  consumer.
- **`▸`-cast corollary:** a term `h ▸ t` (`h : X = rhs`) to specialize `t`'s type fails when the
  goal/expected type displays the *unfolded* `e` (not `X`) — `▸` can't pattern-match across the
  fold and errors "the equality does not contain the expected result type on either side". Fold the
  goal first: `refine …; rw [← hX, h]; exact t` (`← hX` rewrites the goal's `e` back to `X`, then
  `h` rewrites). (Phase 23b LEAF 1 `interiorGroup_acolumn_adjacency`, the `cd.deg_two_split` link.)
- **Lemma-application / `exact` variant (don't `set` the type-bearing atoms at all):** when a *carried
  hypothesis*'s type mentions `e` (e.g. `re`/`hM'eq` over `caseIIICandidate G ends q (cd.edge i) …`)
  and you then `set e_a := cd.edge i …` before `exact`-ing a downstream lemma whose expected type is
  built from those `set` vars (via `(e_a := e_a) …`), the fold rewrites the carried hyp's type to use
  the *local let-bound* `e_a✝`, which no longer *syntactically* matches the lemma's expected type
  (`Application type mismatch: hre has type Function.Injective re✝³ but is expected … re`), even though
  the two are defeq — and folding a heavy candidate/matrix type is expensive enough to blow the whnf
  heartbeat. **Fix: don't `set` the type-bearing atoms.** State the geometry `have`s against the literal
  `cd`-forms and pass the literals to the downstream lemma, so the carried hyps' types are never folded
  and unification pins the implicits from them. (Phase 23f D-CAN-3b `chainData_arm_realization_zero₁₂`,
  feeding `case_III_arm_realization_rowOp`.)
- **Inline `(by omega)` inside an `exact <heavy-result lemma> … (by omega) …` blows the whnf
  heartbeat — name it first.** Same heavy-carrier cost, but triggered by a *deferred tactic block*
  rather than a folded `set` var: when you `exact` a lemma whose **result type** is a heavy
  `ofNormals …/rigidityRows` disjunction and one of its `Fin`-index arguments is written inline as
  `(by omega)`, the elaborator postpones the omega metavariable and re-runs the full heavy-type
  unification (against the `set`-folded goal carrier) before omega resolves. Pull every `Prop`-valued
  arithmetic side-proof out as a named `have hi1 : 1 < (i : ℕ) := by omega` *before* the `exact`, so
  the application's index arg is concrete and the unification stays syntactic. (Phase 23f
  `chainData_dispatch_interior`'s `hwmem` slot, feeding `chainData_bottom_relabel`.)

The general rule: after a `set`/`subst`/`simp only [eqn] at *` that touches the context, re-read
what your *old* hypotheses now say before threading them into a later `rw`. The atom you named is
no longer spelled the way it was when you obtained the hypothesis.

## 44. `rw [map_neg]` on `(-f) x` fails — that is *functional*-side negation; use `LinearMap.neg_apply`

**Symptom.** *"Tactic `rewrite` failed: Did not find an occurrence of the pattern `?f (-?a)`"* on
`rw [map_neg]` against a goal like `(-ρ) (panelSupportExtensor n₁ n₂) = …` (`ρ : Module.Dual ℝ _`,
or any bundled linear map). The `-` is on the *map*, not the argument.

**Cause.** `map_neg` is `f (-a) = -(f a)` — it pushes a negation *out of the argument*. A term
`(-f) a` has the negation on `f` itself (an `AddMonoidHom`/`LinearMap` negated via the module
structure on the hom space), so `map_neg`'s LHS pattern `?f (-?a)` is simply absent. The correct
rewrite is `LinearMap.neg_apply : (-f) a = -(f a)` (the `Neg`-on-the-hom companion; `NegHomClass`
generalisations exist but the bundled-`LinearMap` form is what fires here).

**Fix.** Use `LinearMap.neg_apply` to strip the functional-side negation, *then* `map_neg` for any
argument-side one. The two compose cleanly when both occur — e.g. converting a swapped-orientation
dual evaluation: `rw [LinearMap.neg_apply, panelSupportExtensor_swap, map_neg, …]` turns
`(-ρ) (panelSupportExtensor n₂ n₁)` into `-(ρ (-(panelSupportExtensor n₁ n₂)))` into
`-(-(ρ (panelSupportExtensor n₁ n₂)))` (Phase 22h W8, `CaseI.lean` — the M₂-arm `ρ' := -ρ`
conversions). The general rule: read where the `-` sits before reaching for `map_neg`; argument
vs. functional negation are different lemmas.

## 45. A *combining* diacritic (`ρ̂`, written as base-char + U+0302) is rejected mid-proof — *"expected token"*

**Symptom.** A `set`/`obtain`/`have` introducing an identifier like `ρ̂` fails to parse —
*"expected token"* on the line, often with the column pointing just past the base letter. The same
glyph copy-pasted from a paper or another editor looks fine but Lean won't accept it.

**Cause.** There are two distinct Unicode encodings of "rho-hat": the *precomposed* form is a
single codepoint (and `ŵ` = U+0175 is a precomposed letter Lean *does* accept), but a base letter
**+ a combining diacritic** (`ρ` U+03C1 followed by U+0302 combining circumflex) is two codepoints,
and Lean's lexer does not treat the combining mark as an identifier-continuation character. So
`ρ` + U+0302 lexes as the identifier `ρ` followed by a stray token. Pasting from LaTeX-rendered
math (`\hat\rho`) or some terminals produces the combining form silently.

**Fix.** Don't use combining-diacritic identifiers — pick an ASCII-decorated name (`ρ0`, `rhat`,
`w0`). To detect the form when a glyph mysteriously won't parse, dump the codepoints
(`python3 -c "print([hex(ord(c)) for c in 'ρ̂'])"` — a trailing `0x302` is the combining mark).
Phase 22h W10b (`CaseI.lean`) hit this with a normalized `ρ̂`/`ŵ` family, renamed to `ρ0`/`w0`.

## 46. `Matrix.cons_val_*` won't fire on `![…] ⟨0, h⟩` after `fin_cases` — normalize the `Fin.mk` to the literal first

**Symptom.** After `fin_cases u` (`u : Fin 3`), a hypothesis/goal mentions `![x, y, z] ⟨0, ⋯⟩`
(the index is a `Fin.mk`, not the literal `0`). `simp only [Matrix.cons_val_zero]` reports the
argument as *unused* / makes no progress, and the `vecCons` access never reduces to `x`.

**Cause.** `Matrix.cons_val_zero : vecCons a s 0 = a` matches the *literal* `0 : Fin (n+1)`
(`OfNat`), but `fin_cases` substitutes the anonymous-constructor form `⟨0, by decide⟩`, which is
only *defeq* to `0`, not syntactically equal — so the simp lemma's LHS pattern is absent.

**Fix.** Insert a `show (⟨0, by omega⟩ : Fin 3) = 0 from rfl` (resp. `= 1`, `= 2`) into the
`simp only` set to rewrite the `Fin.mk` to the literal first, *then* `Matrix.cons_val_zero` /
`cons_val_one` / `cons_val_two` (+ `head_cons` / `tail_cons` as needed) fire:
`simp only [show (⟨0, by omega⟩ : Fin 3) = 0 from rfl, Matrix.cons_val_zero] at h`. Because the
three `fin_cases` branches each need a *different* `cons_val_*`, do the reduction *per branch* (a
combined `<;> simp only […]` flags the non-matching args unused). Phase 22h W10b (`CaseI.lean`),
the `fin_cases u` discriminator dispatch.


## 47. ℕ-subtraction in a theorem statement causes `ring` to fail after `push_cast`

**Symptom.** A theorem statement contains `n - 1` where `n : ℕ`, coerced to `ℤ` in a larger
expression. After `push_cast`, `ring` sees `↑(n - 1 : ℕ)` (or `n - 1` still as a ℕ atom in
ℤ) and cannot equate it with `↑n - 1 : ℤ`, leaving an unsolved goal like:
```
⊢ … - ↑(bodyBarDim n) * ↑c + ↑c = … - ↑c * ↑(bodyBarDim n - 1)
```

**Cause.** `↑(n - 1 : ℕ)` and `(↑n - 1 : ℤ)` differ when `n = 0` (ℕ truncates to 0;
ℤ gives −1). `push_cast` cannot resolve `↑(n - 1)` to `↑n - 1` without a proof that `1 ≤ n`,
so it leaves the ℕ coercion atom opaque, and `ring` treats it as distinct from `↑n - 1`.

**Fix.** In the theorem *statement*, write the subtraction in `ℤ` directly:
```lean
-- ❌ ℕ subtraction coerced: ring will fail
... + bodyBarDim n - (bodyBarDim n - 1) * c
-- ✓ ℤ subtraction: ring closes cleanly
... + (bodyBarDim n : ℤ) - ((bodyBarDim n : ℤ) - 1) * c
```
General rule: in theorem statements mixing `ℕ` quantities and `ℤ` arithmetic, cast *before*
subtracting (`(↑n - 1 : ℤ)`) rather than subtract-then-cast (`↑(n - 1 : ℕ)`). Phase 22i L1d
(`Deficiency.lean`, `partitionDef_split_of_sides`). See FRICTION [resolved] *ℕ-subtraction
in a theorem statement causes `ring` to fail*.

**Variant (`linarith` atom mismatch; the ℕ-sub comes from an upstream lemma, not your
statement).** When the `n - 1` originates in a *ℕ-valued* upstream lemma (e.g. a brick returning
`… + (screwDim k - 1) * m + … ≤ …` over `ℕ`), `exact_mod_cast` into a `ℤ` hypothesis leaves the
factor as `↑(screwDim k - 1)` (an `Int.subNatNat` cast) no matter how you spell the target type —
you cannot fix it at the statement, because the *source* is ℕ. A downstream `linarith` that must
cancel this product against another hypothesis spelling it `(↑(screwDim k) - 1) * ↑m` then **fails
silently**: `linarith` treats `↑(a - b)` and `↑a - b` as two *distinct opaque atoms*, so the cut
term never cancels and it reports `linarith failed to find a contradiction`. Fix: with `1 ≤ n` in
hand, post-normalize the casted hypothesis — `rw [Nat.cast_sub h, Nat.cast_one] at hbrickZ` (or
`zify [h] at hbrickZ`) — so both hypotheses carry the identical `(↑n - 1)` atom before `linarith`.
Phase 38 T2a (`AlgebraicInduction/Theorem55.lean`, `cutEdge_finrank_assemble`): keeping the
cut-edge count abstract only works once the brick's `↑(screwDim k - 1)` is aligned with `hk_eq`'s
`(↑(screwDim k) - 1)`.


## 48. Chained subtraction `x - a - b` (or `x - a + b`) fails to parse ("unexpected token '-'", or "overloaded, errors") in Graph-package scope

**Symptom.** A `have h : … x - 1 - 1 …` (any *iterated* infix `-`) inside a file that
imports/opens the `Matroid` package's `Graph` API fails with
`unexpected token '-'; expected ')', ',' or ':'` (inside parens) or
`…; expected command` (at top level) at the *second* minus, often followed by a bogus
`failed to synthesize HSub ℤ ℕ (Sort ?)` or `Type mismatch … expected Prop` — the type parser
silently stopped after the first subtraction. A *single* subtraction parses fine, which makes
the failure look spurious (Phase 22i L1h misattributed it to a `set`-bound variable; the
recurrence at L1i pinned it).

**Symptom (variant, `-` then `+`).** `have heq1 : i - 1 + 1 = i := by omega` (subtraction
*immediately followed by a different operator*, not just a second `-`) fails the same way but
with a more confusing shape: `"overloaded, errors" / "Unknown identifier 'i'"` (reported
*twice*, for both notation candidates) at the `+`, then cascading `unexpected token ':=';
expected command` several lines later at the *next* unrelated `have` — the parser/elaborator
failure on the poisoned line corrupts the perceived tactic-block boundary, so the reported
error position is downstream of the real cause. Confirmed 2026-07-01 (Phase 23g E2d-1,
`chainData_of_isPath`) purely from `{P : WList α β}` merely being *in context* — `P.length`
need not even be referenced.

**Cause.** `Matroid/Graph/Subgraph/Defs.lean` declares
`scoped notation:51 G:100 " - " S:100 => Graph.deleteVerts G S`. Both arguments parse at
level 100, so the notation does not chain: after `x - a` (a level-51 parse), **any** following
operator that needs a ≥100-precedence *left* operand — a second `-`, but equally `+`, `*`, …
— demands a level-100 left operand and the parser cannot reuse the level-51 result. The whole
`-` grammar (including ordinary `HSub`) is poisoned for such continuations while this scoped
notation is in scope (the project's `namespace Graph` files all are — merely having a
`WList`/`Graph`-typed variable in the local context is enough to activate it, no `open` or
reference to a Graph-specific field required).

**Fix.** Parenthesize the chain explicitly — `((x - a) - b)` parses — or restructure to avoid
the iterated literal subtraction (e.g. rewrite `D * (c - 1 - 1)` via `rw [mul_sub, mul_one]`
so the goal-side term is produced by rewriting rather than written in source; the L1i
`splitOff_isKDof_of_exists_base_inter_fiber_lt` route). For the `-`-then-`+` variant,
parenthesizing doesn't help as reliably as **not writing the raw arithmetic at all**: replace
`have heq1 : i - 1 + 1 = i := by omega` with a named-lemma application whose type is built by
substitution, not re-parsed source text — `have heq1 := Nat.sub_add_cancel (show 1 ≤ i by
omega)` (E2d-1's `chainData_of_isPath`, `ChainExtraction.lean`). Phase 22i L1i
(`ForestSurgery.lean`); Phase 23g E2d-1 (`ChainExtraction.lean`).
See FRICTION [resolved] *Chained subtraction fails to parse in Graph scope*.

**Root fix (2026-07-02, user-directed).** The poison is FIXED at the source from the Matroid
fork pin `cb3be62` onward (`bryangingechen/Matroid`, branch `combinatorial-rigidity-fix`): the
notation's RESULT level is raised to the standard subtraction level
(`scoped notation:65 G:100 " - " S:100`) — operands stay at 100, so the graph alternative fires
in exactly the same positions as before and previously-valid arithmetic elaborates untouched.
`-`-continuations now parse normally in Graph scope (verified: `i - 1 + 1 = i := by omega` and
chained `x - 1 - 1`), so this section's workarounds are no longer needed in THIS repo;
graph-typed chains still need parens (`(G - S) - T`), as before. ⚠️ A first attempt that also
loosened the OPERANDS (`G:65 " - " S:66`) created new parse alternatives inside ordinary
arithmetic (`X * Y - Z`) and broke a coercion-sensitive `rw` chain in `CaseI.lean` — precedence
fixes to an overloaded token must widen only the result level, never the operand levels. Also:
an IN-PLACE edit under `.lake/packages/` is NOT an honest gate (git-pinned package traces are
rev-keyed, so downstream project modules may not rebuild — the 65/66 defect passed a full
`lake build` that way); only a pin-bump rebuild verifies a package patch. The symptom/workaround
text above is retained for older checkouts, other repos on the upstream package, and as the
analysis to cite when proposing the fix upstream (apnelson1/Matroid).


## 49. `Pi.single w y u` type-inference failure and `▸` in `Pi.single_eq_of_ne` lambda

**Symptom (a).** `Pi.single w y u` elaborates with a type error — Lean cannot determine the
fill type from context (e.g. when the enclosing `simp` goal has `ScrewSpace k` as the value
type but the elaborator hasn't bound it yet).

**Fix (a).** Annotate the intermediate function: `(Pi.single w y : α → ScrewSpace k) u`.

**Symptom (b).** `Pi.single_eq_of_ne (fun h => hu (h ▸ ...))` fails — Lean can't infer the
type of `h` from the bare lambda.

**Fix (b).** Spell it out explicitly:
```lean
Pi.single_eq_of_ne (show u ≠ w from fun (h : u = w) => hu (h ▸ ...))
```

Phase 22i L4a (`RigidityMatrix.lean`, `flowSum_hingeRow_both_mem` /
`flowSum_hingeRow_both_not_mem`).


## 50. `Function.update_same` renamed to `Function.update_self`; `Submodule.subtype_injective` elaboration

**`Function.update_same`.** The lemma `Function.update_same : Function.update f a (f a) = f a`
(updating a function at a point to its own value is identity) has been renamed to
`Function.update_self` in the current mathlib. Use `Function.update_self` directly.
Phase 22i L4a (`RigidityMatrix.lean`, `flowSum_hingeRow_mem_not_mem`).

**`Submodule.subtype_injective` elaboration collapse.** When passed as a plain term to
`LinearMap.finrank_range_of_inj`, `Submodule.subtype_injective` can elaborate as
`Function.Injective (fun x ↦ x)` (the identity) rather than injectivity of the subtype
inclusion, causing a type mismatch or a false goal. Use `Subtype.coe_injective` directly, which
elaborates unambiguously. Phase 22i L4a (`RigidityMatrix.lean`, `hSc_rk`).

**`le_or_lt` renamed to `le_or_gt`.** The total-order trichotomy split `le_or_lt a b : a ≤ b ∨ b < a`
is `le_or_gt` in the current mathlib (`a ≤ b ∨ a > b`, the same disjunction). Use
`rcases le_or_gt k 0 with hk0 | hk0`. Phase 22j A1 (`RigidityMatrix.lean`,

## 51. `set_option ... in` before a docstring-decorated declaration

**Symptom.** A `set_option maxHeartbeats N in /-- docstring -/ theorem ...` raises a parse
error ("unexpected token 'set_option'; expected 'lemma'") if the `set_option ... in` is placed
*between* the docstring and the theorem keyword.

**Cause.** In Lean 4, `set_option ... in decl` treats the entire decorated declaration
(including any docstring) as the "declaration" argument. The docstring must come *after*
`set_option ... in`, not before it.

**Fix.** Put `set_option ... in` before the docstring:
```lean
set_option maxHeartbeats 400000 in
/-- docstring -/
theorem my_theorem ...
```
Phase 22i L4a (`RigidityMatrix.lean`, `le_finrank_span_rigidityRows_of_cut`).


## 52. `set_option linter.style.openClassical false` must be a standalone command

**Symptom.** Writing `set_option linter.style.openClassical false in open Classical` suppresses
the linter warning for the `open Classical` command itself, but the `Classical` instances are
then only available *during that command's elaboration*, not section-wide. All
`Classical.decEq`-dependent tactics in the section see "no instance for `DecidableEq`" or
similar.

**Cause.** The `in <cmd>` syntax scopes the option to that one command. `open Classical` needs
to persist across the whole section (or file); wrapping it with `in` ends the scope
immediately.

**Fix.** Use two standalone commands:
```lean
set_option linter.style.openClassical false
open Classical
```
The `set_option` applies to all subsequent commands in the same section/file scope and
suppresses the linter warning; `open Classical` persists normally.
Phase 22i L4a (`RigidityMatrix.lean`, `section CutEdgeBrick`).

## 53. `set F := expr` does not fold `F.graph` in conclusions of theorems applied to `F`

**Symptom.** After `set F := PanelHingeFramework.ofNormals G ends q`, a theorem
`le_finrank_span_rigidityRows_of_cut F …` returns a hypothesis `hbrick` that mentions
`(PanelHingeFramework.ofNormals G ends q).graph[V₁]` (the full unfolded form) rather than
`F.graph[V₁]`. A subsequent `rw [hF₁span] at hbrick` (where `hF₁span : F.graph[V₁] = …`)
fails because the LHS `F.graph` does not match the literal expanded expression.

**Cause.** `set` substitutes `F` for `expr` in the *current* hypotheses and goal, but
theorem calls after the `set` elaborate to `expr`'s expanded form in their conclusions;
`set` does not post-process those results.  This is distinct from §43 (which is about
pre-existing hypotheses that `set` *has* folded).

**Fix.** Introduce the graph-equality hypothesis explicitly right after `set`:
```lean
set F := PanelHingeFramework.ofNormals G ends q with hF_def
have hFgraph : F.graph = G := by simp [F, PanelHingeFramework.ofNormals_graph]
```
Then use `rw [hFgraph] at hbrick` (or whichever field is exposed) before the downstream
rewrites that expect the folded form.  The same pattern applies to any structure field
(`F.supportExtensor`, `F.toBodyHinge`, etc.) that a theorem's conclusion mentions unfolded.

Phase 22i L4b-2 (`CaseI.lean`, `case_cut_edge_realization_gp`).

## 54. `letI` (not `haveI`) to shadow `Submodule.addCommMonoid` with `AddCommGroup` for Ring-path lemmas on submodule subtypes

**Symptom.** After writing `haveI : AddCommGroup ↥S := S.addCommGroup`, calls to
`(D.domRestrict S).ker.finrank_quotient_add_finrank` or
`(D.domRestrict S).quotKerEquivRange` fail with:

```
Application type mismatch: D.domRestrict S has type … S.addCommMonoid …
but expected … AddCommGroup.toAddCommMonoid …
```

or a "synthesized type class instance is not definitionally equal to expression
inferred by typing rules: synthesized `S.addCommMonoid`, inferred `hSAG.toAddCommMonoid`"
elaboration failure.

**Cause.** Two distinct `AddCommMonoid ↥S` instances exist for a submodule `S` of
an `AddCommGroup` module:
- `Submodule.addCommMonoid S` (Semiring/AddSubmonoid path, the **global** instance
  `Submodule.instAddCommMonoidSubtypeMemSubmodule`).
- `Submodule.addCommGroup S |>.toAddCommMonoid` (Ring/AddSubgroup path).

These are **not definitionally equal** in Lean 4 — they are synthesized from distinct
typeclass paths. `haveI : AddCommGroup ↥S := S.addCommGroup` declares the instance
in the *local context*, but `domRestrict`, `subtype`, `comap`, and similar ops elaborate
the subtype from the *global* `Submodule.addCommMonoid` instance (which `haveI` does
not shadow). The mismatch surfaces when a downstream Ring-path lemma (`[Ring R] [AddCommGroup M]`)
expects `AddCommGroup.toAddCommMonoid` but finds `Submodule.addCommMonoid`.

**Fix.** Use **`letI`**, not `haveI`:

```lean
letI hSAG : AddCommGroup ↥S := S.addCommGroup
-- Now D.domRestrict S, quotKerEquivRange, finrank_quotient_add_finrank all typecheck.
have hq := (D.domRestrict S).ker.finrank_quotient_add_finrank
have heq : Module.finrank ℝ (↥S ⧸ (D.domRestrict S).ker) =
    Module.finrank ℝ ↥(S.map D) := by
  have h := LinearEquiv.finrank_eq (D.domRestrict S).quotKerEquivRange
  rw [LinearMap.range_domRestrict] at h; exact h
have hker : Module.finrank ℝ ↥(D.domRestrict S).ker =
    Module.finrank ℝ ↥(S ⊓ LinearMap.ker D) := by
  rw [LinearMap.ker_domRestrict,
      ← Submodule.finrank_map_subtype_eq S (Submodule.comap S.subtype (LinearMap.ker D)),
      Submodule.map_comap_subtype]
```

`letI` introduces the instance as a `let`-binding into the elaboration context, which
*does* shadow the global instance for subsequent elaboration. `haveI` only enters a
local hypothesis — it does not shadow global instances.

**Do not** `set N := (D.domRestrict S).ker` with a `set` before using `letI` — the
`set` would elaborate `N`'s type before the shadowing takes effect, re-embedding
`Submodule.addCommMonoid`. Work directly with `(D.domRestrict S).ker` after `letI`.

**Style gate.** A `set_option maxHeartbeats N in` wrapping the `letI`-containing proof
requires a comment explaining the heartbeat increase — `linter.style.maxHeartbeats`
flags the option without one.

Phase 22i L5a-i (`RigidityMatrix.lean`, `le_finrank_span_rigidityRows_of_splice`).

## 55. `linter.style.longLine` counts Unicode codepoints, not bytes — `awk 'length>100'` over-counts

**Symptom.** Reflowing a proof to drop a `set_option linter.style.longLine false in`, you
list the over-length lines with `awk 'length>100'`. On a UTF-8-heavy molecular file (`ℝ`,
`₀`, `─`, `→`, `≤`, `•`, …) this reports far more lines than the linter actually flags
(e.g. 80 vs 37 in `case_II_realization_all_k`), and some lines `awk` flags are fine.

**Cause.** The longLine linter (`Mathlib/Tactic/Linter/Style.lean`) flags a line when its
*column* — i.e. its **Unicode codepoint count** — exceeds `maxLineLength` (default 100,
strict `<`, so exactly 100 is allowed). `awk length` defaults to **bytes**, and a math
glyph is 2–3 bytes (`─` = 3), so byte-length wildly over-reports. The linter also exempts
any line containing `http`.

**Fix.** Count codepoints. Use Python:

```python
with open(path, encoding='utf-8') as f:
    for i, line in enumerate(f, 1):
        s = line.rstrip('\n')
        if len(s) > 100:  # codepoints; matches the linter's `100 < column`
            print(i, len(s))
```

Reflow comment/divider lines by rewrapping text (shorten the trailing `─` run on a
`-- ── Step N: … ────` divider; an exactly-100 result is fine); break code lines at a
natural delimiter (a `rw [a, b, c]` after a `,`; a long dotted prefix
`(Foo.bar baz\n  q).method`; a `have h : T := by` before `:= by` or inside `T`). None
require restructuring a proof.

Phase 22j A2 (`CaseI.lean`, the `case_II_realization_all_k` longLine drop).


## 56. A bare-`Graph.`-prefixed decl *inside* `namespace Foo` creates a `Foo.Graph` sub-namespace that captures downstream `open scoped Graph` — `V(G)`/`E(G)`/`↾` stop parsing and `binop%` flips ℕ-sub→ℤ-sub

**Symptom.** A downstream file that `import`s a module `M` (here `…AlgebraicInduction.CaseI`) and
opens its working namespace — `namespace CombinatorialRigidity.Molecular` then `open scoped Graph` —
suddenly cannot parse the mathlib one-arg graph notations: `V(G)` fails with
`unexpected token ')'; expected ','` (the `apnelson1/Matroid` *global* two-arg `V(" G ", " e ")"`
wins), and `E(G)`/`↾` likewise. **In the same scope**, `binop%` also flips its leaf-coercion choice:
a bare-ℕ `screwDim k - 1` in a ℤ context elaborates as `Int.subNatNat (screwDim k) 1` (ℤ-subtraction)
instead of `↑(screwDim k - 1)` (ℕ-sub-then-cast), so an `exact_mod_cast` from a ℕ inequality fails
with `… has type r₁ + (screwDim 2 - 1) * … but is expected to have type ↑r₁ + Int.subNatNat … * …`.
The *defining* module `M` itself builds fine (it uses `V(G)` throughout); only files that `import M`
and re-enter the namespace see it. Using `open Foo` (not `namespace Foo`) makes both symptoms vanish.

**Cause.** Somewhere in `M` (or its imports), inside `namespace Foo`, a decl is declared with a bare
`Graph.`-prefixed name (`theorem Graph.foo …`). Relative to the open `Foo`, that name resolves to a
**new sub-namespace `Foo.Graph`** — the decl's full name becomes `Foo.Graph.foo`, *not* `_root_.Graph.foo`.
Once `Foo.Graph` exists in the imported environment, a downstream `namespace Foo` + `open scoped Graph`
resolves `Graph` to the **nearest** match — the sub-namespace `Foo.Graph` — so mathlib's *root*-`Graph`
scoped notations (`scoped notation "V(" G ")"`, `E(`, the `↾` restrict / `G - S` deleteVerts infixes)
are never activated. With root-`Graph` scope absent, the global two-arg `V(G, e)` is the only `V(`
parser (notation failure), and the `-`-notation environment that drives `binop%`'s coercion choice
differs (cast flip). `M` itself escapes both because its `open scoped Graph` (at the file head) runs
*before* the offending decl creates `Foo.Graph`, so it correctly opens root `Graph`.

**Fix.** Pin the decl to the root namespace explicitly: `theorem _root_.Graph.foo …` (or wrap it in a
top-level `namespace Graph … end Graph` outside the `Foo` block). This puts it in the project-`Graph`-API
home it was meant to have, removes the `Foo.Graph` sub-namespace, and makes `import M` transparent — no
per-file `open scoped _root_.Graph` or `local notation` re-assertion needed downstream. *Diagnose* by
`#check @Foo.Graph.foo` (if it resolves, the sub-namespace exists) or by confirming `open scoped
_root_.Graph` (forcing the root) fixes the downstream parse. Phase 22j-perf
(`CaseI.lean`, `Graph.rigidContract_vertexSet_inter_eq_singleton` → `_root_.Graph.…`); the
`CaseI.lean`-split blocker. See FRICTION [resolved] *Bare `Graph.`-prefix in `Molecular` namespace*.


## 57. A `-/` *inside a word* in a docstring (e.g. `grade-/ambient`) terminates the doc comment early — *"unexpected identifier; expected 'lemma'"*

**Symptom.** Editing a `/-- … -/` docstring, a `lake build` fails with `unexpected identifier;
expected 'lemma'` (or `unexpected token; expected ':'`) pointing at a column *inside the prose* of
the docstring, several lines *above* the `theorem`/`lemma` keyword — not at the declaration itself.
The same docstring with the offending word reworded parses fine.

**Cause.** Lean's block-comment/doc-comment lexer closes on the first literal `-/` *anywhere*,
including mid-word: prose like `grade-/ambient-generic` or `the grade-/` contains the substring
`-/`, which terminates the `/--` doc comment right there. The rest of the intended docstring then
parses as ordinary tokens, so the `theorem` keyword is reached in an unexpected state (a stray
identifier where a declaration was expected).

**Fix.** Never write `-/` (or `/-`) inside docstring prose. Reword to avoid the slash-dash adjacency
— `grade- and ambient-generic` instead of `grade-/ambient-generic`, `the d=3 case` instead of any
`…-/…`. (Only the two-character sequence `-/` bites; a lone `/` or `-` is fine.)
Phase 23b CHAIN-3 (`Meet.lean`, the `exteriorPower_basis_toDual_eq_pairingDual_comp_map_grade`
docstring; bit twice — once per `grade-/` occurrence).


## 58. After lifting an in-place numeral-pinned `def` to implicit `{d}`, a numeral consumer's `omega` mis-atomizes two elaborations of the same applied term — use `linarith` / `simpa using h`

**Symptom.** A `def` (or its facts) is generalized from a fixed numeral ambient (`Fin 4`) to an
implicit `{d} (Fin (d+1))`, keeping a numeral-pinned consumer green by passing `(d := 3)` in its
`rw`s. A trivial arithmetic close — `hsum : finrank(…) + 1 = 3 + 3`, goal `finrank(…) = 5` — then
fails `omega` with a free-variable counterexample (`0 ≤ c ≤ 4`), as if `hsum` were never read.

**Cause.** The term `finrank ℝ ↥((wedgeFixedLeft a).range ⊔ …)` appears in `hsum` carrying the
`(d:=3)`-elaborated `wedgeFixedLeft a`, while the goal carries the *statement-unified* `Fin 4` one.
The two are defeq (both `d = 3`) but **syntactically distinct** — the implicit `d` arrived by two
different routes — so `omega`/`grind` register them as *separate* opaque atoms and cannot bridge.
This is the §1 atom-split symptom *without* a `set` alias — the split is intrinsic to the
mixed-elaboration term, not introduced by `set`.

**Fix.** Close with `linarith` or `simpa using hsum` instead of `omega`: both work at the
ordered-field / `simp` level where the two finrank views collapse under defeq, treating it as one
atom. (Alternatively, pre-`rw` the goal's term into the `hsum` form so the atoms coincide before
`omega`.) Phase 23b CHAIN-3 (`Meet.lean`, `finrank_sup_range_wedgeFixedLeft`); see FRICTION [idiom]
*Generalizing an in-place numeral-pinned `def`…*.

## 59. A new `Mathlib.Analysis.InnerProductSpace` import regresses a *pre-existing* exterior-algebra proof to `(deterministic) timeout at whnf` — the metric `PiLp`/`EuclideanSpace` instances poison `⋀`-term elaboration

**Symptom.** Adding `public import Mathlib.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.PiL2` (or any
`EuclideanSpace`/`InnerProductSpace`-bearing import) to a metric-free exterior-algebra file
(`Meet.lean`) — to use an orthonormal/inner-product construction in a *new* lemma — makes a
**previously-green, untouched** declaration elsewhere in the file fail with `(deterministic)
timeout at whnf, maximum number of heartbeats (200000)`. The new lemma itself may be fine; the
regression is at an unrelated `complementIso`/`⋀`-term proof.

**Cause.** `EuclideanSpace ℝ ι = PiLp 2 (fun _ => ℝ)` is *reducibly defeq* to the bare carrier
`ι → ℝ` the exterior algebra is built on, so the import's `PiLp 2` inner-product / norm instances on
`Fin (k+2) → ℝ` become **defeq-visible to `whnf`** of the `⋀[ℝ]^j (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)` terms. The
elaborator now considers them while normalizing exterior-power expressions, exploding the
heartbeat budget. This is the diffuse-typeclass cost `notes/ScrewSpaceCarrier-design.md` warns
about — here triggered by an *import*, not a carrier `abbrev`.

**Fix.** Do **not** import the metric layer into the metric-free exterior-algebra file. Two clean
homes for the bridge: (a) put any pure `EuclideanSpace`↔`Module.Basis.toDual` glue in a `Mathlib/`
mirror (mathlib-only deps, no exterior-algebra import) — e.g. the (now-retired, see below)
`Mathlib/Analysis/InnerProductSpace/PiL2.lean`'s `EuclideanSpace.inner_eq_basisFun_toDual` /
`toDualOrthogonal_ofLinearIsometryEquiv`; (b) house the metric-*using* leaves (the Hodge-star
frame-alignment / range-membership steps) in a **new downstream file** that imports both the
exterior-algebra file and the metric layer, so the metric instances never touch the upstream `⋀`
elaboration. Phase 23b CHAIN-3 OD-8 (h-2); see FRICTION [mirrored] *`EuclideanSpace.inner_eq_basisFun_toDual`…*.

**Update (Phase 33 Slice 0, 2026-07-16).** The concrete exemplar this quirk was written against —
`Molecular/MeetHodge.lean`'s Gram–Schmidt frame-alignment, downstream of the mirror above — was
retired: a GL-contragredient reproof (extend the normal pair by an *arbitrary* complement,
`Submodule.exists_isCompl`, instead of an orthonormal one) needs no metric structure at all, so
both the metric-using downstream file and its `Mathlib/` mirror were deleted rather than kept
quarantined. The quirk itself — a metric-layer import poisoning `⋀`-term elaboration in an
untouched proof elsewhere in the same file — remains a live hazard for any future
`EuclideanSpace`/`InnerProductSpace` import into an exterior-algebra file; the two-file
quarantine (a) / (b) above is still the fix when a metric route is genuinely needed.

## 60. The `⧸` quotient notation (`M ⧸ P`) needs a *direct* `import Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Quotient.Basic` — "expected token" even when `Submodule.mkQ` resolves

**Symptom.** A type ascription or `set` using the quotient-module notation `M ⧸ P` fails to parse
with `error: ... expected token` at the `⧸` glyph, in a file that nonetheless resolves
`Submodule.mkQ`, `Submodule.ker_mkQ`, `Submodule.Quotient.mk_eq_zero` etc. by name. (Hit in the
`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/LinearIndependent/Basic.lean` mirror when adding
`linearIndependent_sumElim_block_swap`, which quotients by `span (range base)`.)

**Cause.** The `M ⧸ P` notation (`HasQuotient.Quotient`) is declared in
`Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Quotient.Defs`/`.Basic`, which is **not** transitively re-exported through
the `LinearIndependent`/`Span`/`Finsupp` import surface the mirror already had — the *declarations*
`Submodule.mkQ` reach it transitively, but a notation must be *in scope* (imported directly) to
parse.

**Fix.** Add `public import Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Quotient.Basic` directly. (If you also use
`LinearIndependent.sumElim_of_quotient`, add `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Dimension.Constructions` too.)
Alternatively, sidestep the notation entirely: let the quotient type be *inferred* — `set π :=
P.mkQ` (no `: M →ₗ[K] (M ⧸ P)` ascription) elaborates `π`'s codomain without writing the glyph.
Phase 23b CHAIN-1; see FRICTION [mirrored] *`linearIndependent_sumElim_block_swap`…*.

## 61. `rw [hidx]` on a `getElem` *index* (`l[k]` / `l[k]'h`) trips "motive is not type correct" — re-apply the indexing lemma at the new index, don't rewrite the index in place

**Symptom.** A `getElem` term `l[k]` (or `l[k]'h`) appears with an index `k` you have proved equal to
some `k'` (`hidx : k = k'`); `rw [hidx]` fails with *"Tactic `rewrite` failed: motive is not type
correct"*, citing an application-type-mismatch on the bounds proof (`Nat.mod_lt …` etc.). Hit in
Phase 23b `ChainData.shiftPerm_vtx_top`, where `List.formPerm_apply_getElem` returns
`l[(k+1) % l.length]` and the goal needed that index folded to `0`.

**Cause.** `l[k]` desugars to `getElem l k h` with `h : k < l.length` — a proof whose *type*
mentions `k`. Rewriting `k → k'` would leave `h` proving `k < l.length` where `k' < l.length` is
expected; the motive `fun a => l[a] = …` is not type-correct because the implicit bounds argument
can't follow the index. (This is the `getElem`-index sibling of the §§ 5/18/20 "motive" failures.)

**Fix.** Don't `rw` the index. Instead **re-apply your indexing lemma at the new index expression**,
discharging its bounds side-goal from `hidx`. For a project list with a `getElem_X` accessor
(`getElem_shiftCycle i k h = vtx ⟨k+1, _⟩`):
```lean
rw [cd.getElem_shiftCycle i (((i:ℕ) - 1 + 1) % (cd.shiftCycle i).length) (by rw [hmod]; omega)]
congr 1
simp only [hmod]          -- now the index lives in a non-dependent `Fin.mk`, so `rw`/`simp` is fine
```
Equivalently, `conv` into the index, or use a `getElem`-congruence lemma. The general rule: a
`getElem` index is load-bearing for its own bounds proof — change it by *recomputing the element*,
not by rewriting the index in the existing term.

## 62. *"unexpected token '+'; expected ')'"* on `f ((x : ℕ) - 1 + 2)` — a type-ascription `(e : T)` followed by an arithmetic operator inside a function/constructor argument needs the whole arithmetic expression re-parenthesized

**Symptom.** A subterm like `Set.Iic ((i : ℕ) - 1 + 2)`, `(⟨(i : ℕ) - 1 + 1, h⟩ : Fin n)`, or
`hws ((i : ℕ) - 1 + 2)` fails to parse with *"unexpected token '+'; expected ')', ',' or ':'"* — and
the elaborated term (in a goal display) shows the expression **truncated at the operator** (e.g.
`Set.Iic (↑i - 1)`, dropping the `+ 2`). Hit repeatedly in Phase 23b `chainData_freshEdge_slot_mem`.

**Cause.** A type ascription `(e : T)` is greedy: after `(i : ℕ)` the parser is still inside the
ascription's term grammar and accepts `- 1`, but the *next* binary operator (`+`) is where the
enclosing `(…)` / `⟨…⟩` argument parser expects its closing delimiter. The mixed
ascription-then-arithmetic `( (i : ℕ) - 1 + 2 )` is parsed as `( ((i:ℕ) - 1) ` ⟶ close, leaving `+ 2)`
dangling. (It only bites when an *ascription* is the left operand — a plain `i.val - 1 + 2` is fine.)

**Fix.** Wrap the full arithmetic expression in its own parentheses so the ascription is fully
enclosed before any operator the outer parser cares about:
```lean
Set.Iic (((i : ℕ) - 1) + 2)        -- not  Set.Iic ((i : ℕ) - 1 + 2)
(⟨((i : ℕ) - 1) + 1, h⟩ : Fin n)   -- not  ⟨(i : ℕ) - 1 + 1, h⟩
```
Cheapest tell: if a goal *display* shows your `… + k` silently missing, suspect this before doubting
the math. (Sibling of § 15's "bare literal needs ascription" — there the ascription is *missing*;
here it is *present but under-parenthesized*.)

**Variant — proving `List.ofFn f = x :: …` (a `cons`/head-peel identity).** When the goal is a
*whole-list* equality whose RHS re-indexes the `ofFn` body (`List.ofFn (fun j : Fin (i:ℕ) => vtx
⟨j+1,_⟩) = vtx ⟨1,_⟩ :: List.ofFn (fun j : Fin ((i:ℕ)-1) => vtx ⟨j+2,_⟩)`), `rw [show (i:ℕ) =
((i:ℕ)-1)+1 by omega, List.ofFn_succ]` trips the **same** §61 motive failure (the `ofFn` body's
bounds `_proof` depends on `(i:ℕ)`). Sidestep it with **`List.ext_getElem`** + a `match` on the
index, never rewriting the bound: `refine List.ext_getElem (by simp [defn]; omega) fun m h₁ h₂ =>
?_; rw [getElem_X]; match m with | 0 => simp | m + 1 => rw [List.getElem_cons_succ,
List.getElem_ofFn]`. The `m+1` arm closes by **defeq** (`vtx ⟨m+1+1,_⟩ ≡ vtx ⟨(m)+2,_⟩` as the
`Nat` index reduces), so no `congr 1; omega` tail is needed. Hit in Phase 23b
`ChainData.shiftCycle_eq_cons` (the `shiftPerm` head-peel factorization brick).

## 63. `omega` fails on a goal over `↑(⟨(i : ℕ), h⟩ : Fin m)` even with `hid : (i : ℕ) < …` in scope — it atomizes `Fin.val (Fin.mk …)` *distinctly* from `(i : ℕ)`; force the defeq with `show … from hid`

**Symptom.** Applying a `Fin (m+1)`-indexed lemma at an anonymous-constructor index
`⟨(i : ℕ), _⟩` (with `i : Fin m`) — e.g. `cd.chainData_freshEdge_slot_mem ⟨(i : ℕ), _⟩ (by omega) (by
omega) …` — the `(by omega)` for the lemma's `(i : ℕ) < cd.d` side-goal *fails*, even though
`hid : (i : ℕ) < cd.d` is in context. The reported counterexample names the atom `↑↑i` and is
**self-contradictory** as a refutation (the listed constraints actually *satisfy* the goal), the tell
that omega is reasoning about the *wrong variable*. Hit in Phase 23b `chainData_relabel_arm_hρGv`.

**Cause.** The lemma's side-goal, after instantiating its index parameter to `⟨(i : ℕ), _⟩ : Fin
(m+1)`, reads `((⟨(i : ℕ), _⟩ : Fin (m+1)) : ℕ) < cd.d`. The `Fin.val (Fin.mk (i:ℕ) _)` head is
*definitionally* `(i : ℕ)`, but `omega` atomizes it **syntactically** as a fresh variable (`↑↑i`,
distinct from the `↑i` in `hid`) and never reduces it, so it can't connect the hypothesis. (Same
family as § 58's "two elaborations of one term mis-atomized".)

**Fix.** Force the defeq before handing the term to omega — `show`/`from` is the cheapest:
```lean
refine cd.lemma ⟨(i : ℕ), by omega⟩
  (show 1 ≤ (i : ℕ) by omega) (show (i : ℕ) < cd.d from hid) …
```
`show (i : ℕ) < cd.d from hid` (or `(show … by omega)`) restates the side-goal at the *reduced* form,
which Lean accepts by defeq, so omega/`hid` sees the right atom. (`simp only [Fin.val_mk]` also
reduces it but the `simpNF` linter then flags `Fin.val_mk` as an *unused* simp arg — the reduction
fires via `dsimp`, not the lemma — so prefer `show`.) **Lifted to:** this entry; FRICTION pointer.

## 64. A lemma whose *goal* exposes `Matrix.rank` (or `mulVec`/`mulVecLin`) on a constructed column type needs `[Fintype]` on that type in the signature — `[Finite] + classical`/`Fintype.ofFinite` inside the proof is too late

**Symptom.** *"failed to synthesize instance of type class `Fintype (n₁ ⊕ n₂)`"* reported at the
**goal-statement** position (the `theorem … : … ≤ (Matrix.fromBlocks A B 0 D).rank` line), not inside
the proof — even though the proof opens with `haveI : Fintype n₁ := Fintype.ofFinite n₁` etc. Hit
authoring Phase 23d's A3 `Matrix.rank_fromBlocks_zero₂₁_ge_of_linearIndependent_rows` with the column
blocks typed `[Finite n₁] [Finite n₂]`.

**Cause.** `Matrix.rank A := finrank R (LinearMap.range A.mulVecLin)`, and `mulVecLin`/`mulVec` sum
over the **column** index, so they carry a `[Fintype <columns>]` instance argument. When the *goal
type* mentions `(…).rank` on a matrix whose column type is a *constructed* type (`n₁ ⊕ n₂`, a `Pi`,
a `Fin (f k)` …), that `Fintype` must be available **when the signature elaborates** — which is
strictly before the proof body runs. A `haveI`/`classical`/`Fintype.ofFinite` inside the `by` block
cannot satisfy it; the statement never type-checks. (Contrast the project's `Finite`-hypothesis
lemmas like `exists_submatrix_det_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_rows`: their *statements* don't expose
`.rank` on a built type, so they can defer to an in-proof `Fintype.ofFinite`.)

**Fix.** Put `[Fintype n₁] [Fintype n₂]` (the summands) in the signature; `Fintype (n₁ ⊕ n₂)` then
synthesizes automatically at the goal type. Only revert to `[Finite]` + in-proof `ofFinite` when the
constructed type appears **solely inside the proof**, never in the stated goal. Rule of thumb: if the
goal text contains `.rank` / `mulVec` on anything other than a bare hypothesis variable, the column
type's `Fintype` belongs in the signature.

## 65. A duplicate top-level decl name in a shared namespace builds fine per-file but fails the whole-project lint — name-check before naming, and lint (not just build) before commit

**Symptom.** `lake build <your module>` succeeds, but `lake lint` (`runLinter`, the CI gate) aborts
with *"uncaught exception: import <YourModule> failed, environment already contains 'Ns.foo' from
<OtherModule>"*. Hit landing Phase 23d's A4.5: a new `screwBasis` in `RigidityMatrix/Concrete.lean`
collided with an existing `Molecular.screwBasis` in `AlgebraicInduction/PanelLayer.lean` (a *different*
type — powerset-indexed vs `Fin`-indexed basis — but the *same* fully-qualified name).

**Cause.** `lake build <module>` elaborates only that module's import-closure; if the clashing sibling
is not in that closure (the two files don't import each other), the duplicate is invisible. The
whole-project linter loads **all** default modules into one environment, where two decls with the same
fully-qualified name collide. So a single-file green build is **not** evidence the name is free — only
a project-wide load is. (`Molecular` is the busiest shared namespace in the project; the risk is
highest there.)

**Fix.** Before naming a new top-level decl in a shared namespace, check the name is free:
`grep -rn "def <name>\b" <subtree>` or `lean_local_search "<name>"`. If taken, pick a distinct name
(here: `finScrewBasis` for the `Fin`-indexed variant). And **run `lake lint` before commit**, not just
`lake build <module>` — this class of failure is lint-only. (The build/lint-gate section in
`CombinatorialRigidity/CLAUDE.md` already mandates both; this is *why* build-alone is insufficient.)

## 66. `rw [defName, …apiLemma]` fails with *"synthesized type class instance is not definitionally equal"* when the def carries a `Classical.decEq` in its body — use `simp only`, which is lenient on instances

**Symptom.** Unfolding a `noncomputable def` with `rw [defName, …]` then rewriting with a structural
API lemma (here `Basis.dualBasis_equivFun` / `Pi.basis_apply`) errors:
*"synthesized type class instance is not definitionally equal to expression inferred by typing rules,
synthesized `fun a b ↦ a.instDecidableEqSigma b` / inferred `Classical.decEq (…)`"*. Hit landing
Phase 23d's A5c proving `dualProductCoordEquiv_apply`: `dualProductCoordEquiv`'s body supplies its
`Σ`-index `DecidableEq` *classically* (`haveI : DecidableEq ((_:α) × Fin …) := Classical.decEq _`),
but the lemma's ambient `[DecidableEq α]` makes `rw` re-synthesize the *derived* `instDecidableEqSigma`
for the same `Σ`-type, and the two `Decidable` terms are not syntactically/defeq-equal (both are
correct — `Decidable` is a `Subsingleton` — but `rw` matches instances strictly).

**Cause.** `rw` requires the rewrite lemma's instance arguments to be *syntactically* (up to defeq that
`isDefEq` accepts under the strict transparency `rw` uses) equal to the ones in the goal. A def that
freezes a `Classical.decEq` (or any specific `Decidable`/`DecidableEq`) in its body carries *that*
instance through the unfold, while the surrounding proof context resynthesizes a *different* canonical
one — so `rw [apiLemma]` reports the instance mismatch even though the statement is true.

**Fix.** Use `simp only [defName, …, apiLemma]` for the whole unfold-and-rewrite chain. `simp` closes
instance-argument goals up to defeq (it does not demand syntactic instance match), so the `Classical`-vs-
derived `DecidableEq` discrepancy dissolves. (`congr 1` to peel the outer application, then `rw` on the
exposed sub-equality, also works when `simp only` over-simplifies — `congr` re-states the goal so the
two `Pi.single` constructors' instances re-unify; but `simp only` is the one-step fix.) Related but
distinct from § 38 (the `whnf`-timeout on unfolding a dual/exterior-power iso *in place* — there the cure
is a generic helper over an abstract basis; here the iso unfolds fine, only its frozen `Decidable`
instance trips `rw`).

## 67. `V(G)`/`E(G)` (and `↾` / `G - S`) scoped Graph notation is *not in scope* in `Molecular/RigidityMatrix/` files — use the `G.edgeSet`/`G.vertexSet` dot form

**Symptom.** A def/theorem-signature binder written with the mathlib `Graph` notation —
`(hgp : ∀ e ∈ E(F.graph), …)`, `{e // e ∈ E(F.graph)} × Fin …`, or `… ↾ E(G)` — fails to *parse*
in a `CombinatorialRigidity/Molecular/RigidityMatrix/*.lean` file with `unexpected token '(';
expected ','` (the `∀ e ∈` binder case) or `… expected '}'` (the subtype case), at the column of
`E`/`V`. The same syntax is accepted by `lean_multi_attempt` (its REPL insertion context has the
`Graph` scope active), which makes the failure look spurious. Hit landing Phase 23d's A4.5e
(`rigidityMatrixEdge`) — the edge-restricted matrix's `∀ e ∈ E(F.graph), …` hypotheses.

**Cause.** `E(`/`V(`/`↾`/`G - S` are **`scoped notation` on `namespace Graph`** (mathlib +
the `apnelson1/Matroid` package). They are active only where `Graph` is open — either via
`namespace Graph` (e.g. `Molecular/Deficiency.lean`, `Molecular/Induction/Operations.lean`) or an
explicit `open scoped Graph`. The `Molecular/RigidityMatrix/` files (`Basic.lean`, `Concrete.lean`,
…) sit in `namespace CombinatorialRigidity.Molecular` with `open Module Matrix` and **no**
`open Graph`; they refer to graphs through `F.graph.IsLink` / `F.graph.edgeSet` *dot notation*
throughout and never use the bracket notation. So the notation simply isn't declared here — this is
**not** § 48 / § 56 (where the notation is present but *poisons* `-` chains or loses a notation war).
The "the project's `Molecular/` files all are [in `Graph` scope]" aside in § 48 is wrong for these
files.

**Fix.** Use the dot form in the signature: `∀ e ∈ F.graph.edgeSet, …`, `{e // e ∈ F.graph.edgeSet}`,
`F.graph.vertexSet`. It is definitionally the same set (`E(G) ⇒ Graph.edgeSet G`) and matches the
file's existing `F.graph.IsLink` style; `IsLink.edge_mem : G.IsLink e x y → e ∈ E(G)` still produces
the `e ∈ F.graph.edgeSet` proof (the `∈` is plain set membership, no notation needed). Doc-comment
*prose* can keep the readable `E(G)` form — it is only the elaborated signature that needs the dot
form. (If a file genuinely wants the bracket notation, add `open scoped Graph` near the top — but for
a one-off signature the dot form is lighter and consistent with the surrounding `.graph.IsLink`.)

## 68. An `unusedSimpArgs` warning can be a *false signal* — a missing *sibling* lemma stalled `simp` upstream of the flagged arg

**Symptom.** `simp only [..., L, ...]` reports *"This simp argument is unused: `L`"* (or leaves the
goal partly reduced), and the obvious read — "drop `L`" — is **wrong**: dropping `L` then leaves a
sub-term unreduced and the goal unsolved. The arg is genuinely needed; `simp` just never reached the
point where it fires because a *different*, sibling lemma was missing from the set. Hit landing Phase
23d's leaf-1 corner-entry generalization (`Concrete.lean`,
`rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_apply_corner` at `(ends p.1.1).2 ≠ v`): reducing
`columnOp hva (Pi.single v s)` at body `v` (`(Pi.single v s) v + (Pi.single v s) a`, needing
`Pi.single_eq_of_ne hva.symm` for the `a`-coordinate) **and** at the second endpoint
(`(Pi.single v s) (ends p.1.1).2`, needing `Pi.single_eq_of_ne hv2`). With only `hva.symm` in the
set, `hva.symm` was flagged *unused* — because the `v`-coordinate `add` could not collapse
(`add_zero` blocked) until the second-endpoint term was also `0`, which needed the missing `hv2`.

**Cause.** `simp only` applies its lemmas to a fixpoint; a lemma flagged "unused" simply never
matched *over the trace it actually ran*. When two parallel sub-terms each need their own instance of
the same lemma family (here `Pi.single_eq_of_ne` at two different non-pin indices), omitting one
arrests the rewrite before the other's enabling normal form appears, so the present sibling looks
inert. This is distinct from § 46 / § 63 (arg flagged unused because a *simproc*/`dsimp` already did
the reduction) and from § 43 (a `set`-fold hid the pattern): here the arg is correct and the fix is
to *add*, not remove.

**Fix.** Before deleting a "supposedly unused" simp arg, check whether a *sibling* sub-term of the
same shape is still unreduced in the post-`simp` goal (read it with `lean_goal`); if so, supply the
sibling lemma instance for it (`Pi.single_eq_of_ne hv2` alongside `Pi.single_eq_of_ne hva.symm`),
which both unblocks the reduction and clears the warning. Only after the goal is closed should you
trust an `unusedSimpArgs` warning enough to drop the named arg.

## 69. Threading a `Matrix p p` LEFT factor into `(A * B).submatrix …` — `*`/`HMul` needs *syntactically* equal index types (defeq via a `… = G` `rfl` is not enough), and `set F := candidate` then *splits* the `Fintype` instance off the factor's type

**Symptom.** Adding a unit-det LEFT factor `Lrow : Matrix p p ℝ` to an existing
`(M * U).submatrix re en = fromBlocks …` cert (so it becomes `(Lrow * M * U).submatrix …`), where
`M = (caseIIICandidate G …).rigidityMatrixEdge` is indexed by `{e // e ∈ F.graph.edgeSet} × Fin (D−1)`.
Two cascading failures: (a) typing `Lrow` at `{e // e ∈ G.edgeSet} × …` gives *"failed to synthesize
`HMul (Matrix (E(G) × …) …) (Matrix (E((caseIIICandidate …).graph) × …) …) ?`"* even though
`(caseIIICandidate …).graph = G` holds by `rfl`; (b) after retyping `Lrow` at the candidate-graph form
and `set F₀ := caseIIICandidate …`, the downstream core call reports *"Application type mismatch:
`hLrow` has type `IsUnit Lrow✝.det` but is expected `IsUnit Lrow.det`"*.

**Cause.** (a) `HMul`/`Matrix.instHMul` unifies the *contracted* index types **syntactically** during
instance search — it does not whnf-reduce `(caseIIICandidate …).graph.edgeSet` to `G.edgeSet`, so the
two `Matrix`es over rfl-equal-but-distinct index expressions have no `HMul` instance. (b) `set F₀ :=
expr with hF₀` rewrites *every* occurrence of `expr` in all hypotheses **and their types**, including
the candidate occurrence buried inside `Lrow`'s type and inside `hLrow : IsUnit Lrow.det`; the rewrite
re-elaborates the `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` instances on the (now-`F₀`-phrased) index, producing a
`Lrow✝`/instance that no longer matches the one the un-rewritten core call synthesizes. Related to § 53
(`set` not *folding* `F.graph` in *conclusions*) and § 64 (`[Fintype]` on a constructed index must be
in the *signature*), but the failure mode here is `*`-index syntactic match + `set` *splitting* an
instance, not folding/late-instance.

**Fix.** Type the LEFT factor at the **same syntactic index** as the matrix it multiplies — i.e. at
`{e // e ∈ (caseIIICandidate G …).graph.edgeSet} × …`, the literal form `rigidityMatrixEdge` carries —
and supply the subtype `Fintype` as an explicit signature binder (`[Fintype {e // e ∈
(caseIIICandidate G …).graph.edgeSet}]`; subtype `Fintype` is never auto-synthesized, § 64). Then in
the body do **not** `set F₀`; call the core on the literal candidate expression
(`(caseIIICandidate G …).finrank_… ends hgp hends' Lrow hLrow …`) and discharge the link hypothesis
with `rw [caseIIICandidate_graph]; exact hends` stated at the literal form. Dropping `set` keeps the
single `Fintype` instance shared between `Lrow`'s type, `hLrow`, and the core call. Phase 23e item
(3b″), the cert `Lrow`-reshape (`case_III_rank_certification_zero₁₂`, `Candidate.lean`).

## 70. Ring arithmetic on `Fin m` for a *variable* `m` (with `[NeZero m]`) — `CommRing`/`NatCast` are **scoped**, not global; `open Fin.NatCast Fin.CommRing in` to use `ring`/`(t : Fin m)` cast

**Symptom.** In a proof over `Fin m` for a variable `m` (`[NeZero m]` in scope, e.g. from
`3 ≤ m`), a natural-number cast `(t : Fin m)` (with `t : ℕ`) fails with *"Type mismatch: `t`
has type `ℕ` but is expected to have type `Fin m`"* — the ℕ→`Fin m` coercion is not inserted.
Likewise `ring` reports no `CommRing (Fin m)` and `Fin.cast_val_eq_self` / `Fin.val_one'` /
`push_cast` (which need `NatCast (Fin m)`) do not fire.

**Cause.** Mathlib deliberately does **not** register `CommRing (Fin n)` or `NatCast (Fin n)`
as *global* instances (`Mathlib/Data/ZMod/Defs.lean`): a global ℕ→`Fin n` cast would create a
coercion loop that silently rewrites `x < n` to `x < ↑n` (wraparound). They live as **scoped**
instances `Fin.CommRing` / `Fin.NatCast` / `Fin.IntCast`. Only `Add`, `Mul`, `One`, and
crucially `AddCommGroup (Fin m)` (via the global `Fin.instNonUnitalCommRing`) are available
without opening a scope — so `abel` works out of the box, but `ring`, ℕ-cast, and the `natCast`
lemmas do not. (For a *literal* `Fin (k+1)` the `CommRing` instance *is* found via the
`Fin (n+1)` path; the failure is specific to a variable `m` where `[NeZero m]` is the only
handle.)

**Fix.** Prefix the declaration with `open Fin.NatCast Fin.CommRing in` (both scopes: `NatCast`
for the cast + `cast_val_eq_self`/`val_natCast`/`val_one'` lemmas, `CommRing` for `ring` and
`AddMonoidWithOne`-backed `push_cast`). This scopes the instances to the single declaration, so
the coercion-loop quirk cannot leak. `open … in` must sit **before** the doc comment (`/-- … -/
open … in\ntheorem …` is a parse error *"unexpected token 'open'"*). Cyclic-`Fin m` reachability
(`∀ i, ∃ t : ℕ, i = j + (t : Fin m)`, via `t := (i - j).val` + `Fin.cast_val_eq_self` + `abel`)
then goes through. Landed in `isKDof_zero_of_cycle` (`Molecular/Deficiency.lean`, Phase 23g E2c).

(Two smaller companions from the same proof: `le_or_lt` is **not** in scope in this mathlib —
use `Nat.lt_or_ge a b : a < b ∨ a ≥ b`; and a `⨆ f : α → α, …` supremum needs a
`haveI : Nonempty (α → α) := ⟨id⟩` for `ciSup_le`, exactly as the sibling `isKDof_zero_of_triangle`.)

## 71. A `Set.PairwiseDisjoint`/`Pairwise (Disjoint on f)` disjointness goal unfolds to `Function.onFun Disjoint f a b`, not literally `Disjoint (f a) (f b)` — `rw [Set.disjoint_left]` can't find the pattern; supply the proof as a term instead

**Symptom.** Discharging the pairwise-disjointness side-condition of a disjoint-union cardinality
lemma (`Set.Finite.ncard_biUnion`, `Set.ncard_iUnion_of_finite`, `disjoint_disjointed`, …) with a
tactic block `fun a _ b _ hab => by rw [Set.disjoint_left]; …` fails: *"Tactic `rewrite` failed:
Did not find an occurrence of the pattern `Disjoint ?m ?m` in the target expression
`Function.onFun Disjoint (fun a ↦ …) a b`"*.

**Cause.** `Set.PairwiseDisjoint`/`Pairwise (Disjoint on f)` are stated through the `on`
combinator, so the *elaborated* goal at a pairwise site is `Function.onFun Disjoint f a b`, which
is *definitionally* — but not *syntactically* — `Disjoint (f a) (f b)`. `rw` matches syntactically
against the goal's head symbol, so it never sees a `Disjoint` application to rewrite against, even
though `simp`/`exact`/term-mode elaboration would unfold `Function.onFun` without complaint.

**Fix.** Don't `rw` on the goal; supply the disjointness proof as a **term**, letting elaboration
unify it against the `Function.onFun`-wrapped expected type via defeq: `fun a _ b _ hab =>
Set.disjoint_left.mpr (by rintro x hx hx'; …)` (or `Disjoint.mono` / a direct `Set.disjoint_left.2`
application) — never `rw [Set.disjoint_left]` first. Landed in `Graph.chainWalk_charging`
(`ForestSurgery/ChainExtraction.lean`, Phase 23g E2d-6) discharging `(Set.toFinite s).ncard_biUnion`'s
pairwise-disjoint argument; first hit (narrower, not lifted at the time) in
`Graph.exists_balanced_forest_packing` — `notes/FRICTION.md` *"`Set.ncard_iUnion_of_finite` returns
a `finsum`…"*.

**Two companions from the E2c wrapper (`cycle_isProperRigidSubgraph`, same file).** (a) "Available
without opening a scope" for `AddCommGroup (Fin m)` still means `[NeZero m]` must be a *local*
instance — at variable `m` the group instance is itself guarded on it, so a bare `abel` on a
`k - ⟨1, by omega⟩ + ⟨1, by omega⟩ = k`-shaped goal silently reports *"`abel_nf` made no progress"*
(not a missing-instance error) until a `haveI : NeZero m := ⟨by omega⟩` is added — cheaper to add
it unconditionally at the top of any such proof than to chase the silent no-op. (b) Type-ascribing
*only* the anonymous-constructor summand — `k - (⟨1, by omega⟩ : Fin m) + ⟨1, by omega⟩` — misparses
into an unrelated `Graph.deleteVerts` overload-resolution error two tokens later (`Sub.sub`'s
elaboration goes looking for an instance before the ascription pins the type); ascribe the **whole**
arithmetic expression instead, `(k - ⟨1, by omega⟩ : Fin m) + ⟨1, by omega⟩`.

## 72. `zify`/`push_cast` only casts the *outer* layer of a `∑ᶠ u ∈ s, f u` `finsum`, not the summand — convert to `Finset.sum` before casting

**Symptom.** A hypothesis `h : (n - 2) * ∑ᶠ u ∈ Vge3, G.degree u ≤ …` is cast with `zify [hn2] at
h`, and a separately-derived `have hval : (∑ᶠ u ∈ Vge3, G.degree u : ℤ) = 2 * E - 2 * X := …`
fails to `rw`/`linarith` against `h`: the two mention what look like the same subterm, but `h`'s
cast form is `∑ᶠ x, ↑(∑ᶠ (_ : x ∈ Vge3), G.degree x)` — a `finsum`-of-`finsum` with the cast stuck
one level *inside* the outer binder — rather than the "obviously right" `∑ᶠ u ∈ Vge3, ↑(G.degree
u)`.

**Cause.** The `∑ᶠ u ∈ s, f u` notation desugars to `∑ᶠ u, ∑ᶠ (_ : u ∈ s), f u` (an indicator
`finsum`-of-`finsum`, not a primitive binder). `zify`'s cast-pushing simp set has a lemma for
`↑(finprod/finsum …)` that fires on the *outer* application, but the pushed-in cast then sits in
front of the *inner* `finsum` (a different, nested application) rather than continuing to
distribute down to `f x` — so the cast stalls one layer too early, and the result is defeq to,
but not syntactically the same term as, the fully-distributed form.

**Fix.** Never cast a `finsum` expression directly. First convert it to a `Finset.sum` —
`finsum_mem_eq_finite_toFinset_sum f (Set.toFinite s) : ∑ᶠ u ∈ s, f u = ∑ u ∈ hs.toFinset, f u` —
and `rw` every hypothesis mentioning the `finsum` into that `Finset.sum` form *before* `zify`.
`Finset.sum`'s cast is a genuine `Nat.cast_sum` simp lemma and pushes through to the summand
cleanly, so subsequent `rw`/`linarith` against a `∑ i ∈ s, (↑(f i) : ℤ)`-shaped hand-written
target unify as expected. Landed in `Graph.chainWalk_terminated_contradiction`
(`ForestSurgery/ChainExtraction.lean`, Phase 23g E2d-7).


## 73. `h ▸ hyp i` under a `fun` binder over `set`/`let`-bound locals — "failed to create binder due to failure when reverting variable dependencies"

**Symptom.** Supplying a transported family inline — `fun i => hFgraph ▸ hlink i`, with
`hFgraph : F.graph = G` and `F` introduced by `set F := (…).toBodyHinge with hFdef` (itself over a
`let`-bound seed `q₀`) — fails to elaborate with *failed to create binder due to failure when
reverting variable dependencies*.

**Cause.** `▸` builds its rewrite motive by abstracting the transported term's type; under the
lambda this must generalize the `set`-bound local `F`, which drags in its value's dependency chain
(the `let`-bound `q₀`), and the revert fails inside the binder. Outside a binder the same `▸`
works (the triangle-base precedent `hFgraph ▸ hG_ea` passes single facts, not families).

**Fix.** Hoist the transport out of the binder — prove the `∀`-form once by rewriting the goal,
then pass the family whole:

```lean
have hlinkF : ∀ i, F.graph.IsLink (edge i) (vtx i) (vtx (i + 1)) := by
  rw [hFgraph]; exact hlink
```

Landed in `PanelHingeFramework.cycle_realization` (`CaseIII/Arms.lean`, Phase 23g E5c).

## 74. `decide` on a `Nat.card (Fin n)` comparison can pass in an isolated MCP `lean_run_code` snippet yet fail the real project build — rewrite via `Nat.card_fin` first

**Symptom.** `Graph.freshEdgeSupply_of_card_lt (n := 3) (by decide) (by decide)` — discharging
`bodyBarDim 3 * (Nat.card (Fin 2) - 1) < Nat.card (Fin 7)` — elaborated with zero diagnostics via
the `lean_lsp` MCP's `lean_run_code` tool, but the identical term failed a real `lake build` with
*"Tactic `decide` failed for proposition … its `Decidable` instance … did not reduce to `isTrue`
or `isFalse`"*, stuck on `(bodyBarDim 3 * (Nat.card (Fin 2) - 1)).succ.ble (Nat.card (Fin 7))`.

**Cause.** `Nat.card α` is defined through `Cardinal.mk`/`Classical.choice` and does not
kernel-reduce to a literal even for `α = Fin n` — mathlib instead proves `Nat.card (Fin n) = n` as
a *lemma* (`Nat.card_fin`, via `Nat.card_eq_fintype_card` + `Fintype.card_fin`), not a `rfl`. Why
the `lean_run_code` sandbox let `decide` through anyway is unclear (a stale/pre-populated
elaboration cache is one guess); the practical lesson is that a green `lean_run_code` result is
not sufficient evidence for a `decide` whose goal contains `Nat.card` — always re-verify with a
real `lake build` before trusting it.

**Fix.** Rewrite every `Nat.card (Fin n)` to its literal first, then let `decide`/`norm_num`
finish the now fully-computable nat goal:

```lean
(by simp only [Nat.card_fin]; decide)
```

Landed in `Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/Nonvacuity.lean` (the `hfresh` repair, F2, Phase
23-cleanup).

## 75. Dot notation `.mp`/`.mpr` on a bare `Iff` lemma fails with "Unknown constant" when the lemma's structure argument is *explicit*

**Symptom.** For a lemma stated with an *explicit* structure parameter — e.g. mathlib's
`theorem SimpleGraph.mem_commonNeighbors {u v w : V} : u ∈ G.commonNeighbors v w ↔ G.Adj v u ∧
G.Adj w u`, where `#check @SimpleGraph.mem_commonNeighbors` reveals the real signature
`∀ {V} (G : SimpleGraph V) {u v w}, …` (`G` comes from a `variable (G : SimpleGraph V)`, bound
*explicitly*, in the enclosing section) — writing `mem_commonNeighbors.mpr ⟨…⟩` with `G` left for
Lean to infer fails with `error: Unknown constant 'SimpleGraph.mem_commonNeighbors.mpr'`. This is
a name-resolution failure, not a type error: generalized field notation `x.f` auto-inserts
metavariables only for *implicit*/instance-implicit leading arguments of `x`'s type while hunting
for the `Iff`/structure head to project into; an *explicit* leading argument blocks that search,
so Lean falls back to plain-identifier lookup of the literal dotted name and reports it missing.

**Fix.** Supply the explicit argument first — either dot-call on *it* instead of the lemma
(`G.mem_commonNeighbors.mpr ⟨…⟩`, since `G`'s type `SimpleGraph V` matches the lemma's first
explicit parameter) or name the argument (`(mem_commonNeighbors (G := G)).mpr ⟨…⟩`). Cheap tell:
`#check @lemmaName` — if the parameter immediately left of the `Iff`/structure conclusion sits in
`(...)` rather than `{...}`, bare dot-projection needs it supplied first. If the lemma is itself
`Iff.rfl` (as here), the cheapest dodge is to skip the named lemma and supply the underlying
(definitionally equal) term directly instead of calling it at all.

**Worked case:** hit proving `SimpleGraph.isClique_closedNeighborSet_square` in `SquareGraph.lean`
(Phase 25, leaf W3) — `mem_commonNeighbors.mpr ⟨hx.symm, hy.symm⟩` failed this way; resolved by
providing the `Set.Nonempty` witness directly (`⟨v, hx.symm, hy.symm⟩`), relying on
`mem_commonNeighbors` being `Iff.rfl`.

## 76. `omit [inst] in` must sit *before* the declaration's doc comment, not after — "unexpected token 'omit'; expected 'lemma'"

**Symptom.** Writing
```
/-- doc comment -/
omit [Finite V] in
theorem foo (G : SimpleGraph V) : … := …
```
fails to parse with `error: unexpected token 'omit'; expected 'lemma'`, reported at the *end of
the preceding doc comment*. The `omit […] in` modifier is a command-level combinator (like
`private`/`protected`), not part of the declaration body, so it must attach directly to the
`theorem`/`lemma`/`def` keyword; a doc comment in between breaks the combinator's own parse (it
still expects a `lemma`-shaped continuation) rather than attaching to the declaration.

**Fix.** Put `omit […] in` *above* the doc comment:
```
omit [Finite V] in
/-- doc comment -/
theorem foo (G : SimpleGraph V) : … := …
```
(mirrors every existing `omit […] in` use in the project, e.g. `PanelHinge.lean`,
`PebbleGame/Correctness.lean` — grep `omit \[` for more examples before guessing the order).

**Worked case:** hit landing `SimpleGraph.shadowGraph_simple` and two sibling lemmas in
`Molecular/Molecule/Carrier.lean` (Phase 26, leaf F4) — the automatically-included section
variable `[Finite V]` was unused in three lemmas not needing finiteness, and the first attempt at
`omit [Finite V] in` after each doc comment failed to parse; reordering fixed all three at once.

## 77. `rw` on a bare numeral/`Nat.card V` fails "motive is not type correct" when the *same* literal also occurs inside an unrelated dependent-type index elsewhere in the goal — feed the raw equalities to `omega` instead

**Symptom.** A closing step needs `screwDim 2 = 6` and `Nat.card V = Fintype.card V` folded into an
arithmetic goal/hypothesis, so the natural move is `rw [hscrew]` / `rw [hcard]`. Both fail:

```
error: … Tactic `rewrite` failed: motive is not type correct:
  fun _a ↦ ↑(Module.finrank ℝ …) = 6 + G.shadowGraph.deficiency 3
Error: Application type mismatch: The argument
  G.shadowGraph
has type
  Graph V (Sym2 V ⊕ Fin (6 * (Nat.card V - 1) + 1))
but is expected to have type
  Graph V (Sym2 V ⊕ Fin (_a * (Nat.card V - 1) + 1))
```

**Cause.** `rw` abstracts *every* syntactic occurrence of the rewritten term into the motive. The
literal `6` (or `Nat.card V`) appears both in the arithmetic expression being targeted *and*,
completely unrelated, inside another subterm's implicit dependent-type argument in the same
context — here `G.shadowGraph : Graph V (Sym2 V ⊕ Fin (6 * (Nat.card V - 1) + 1))`, where `6` and
`Nat.card V` are baked into the label-type index. `rw` tries to generalize both occurrences
uniformly and the resulting motive fails to type-check, even though the intended target occurrence
has nothing to do with the unrelated one. This is the "same bare atom leaks into an unrelated
dependent type elsewhere in the same goal" flavor of the family (compare § 33's `Submodule` eq
under `finrank ℝ ↥(…)`, § 61's `getElem` index) — the common thread is a plain-looking `rw` target
that is not as syntactically localized as it looks.

**Fix.** Don't `rw` the numeral/cardinality fact into place at all. Carry it as a separate `have`
and hand every relevant fact — the target equalities/inequalities, still in their original
un-rewritten form — to `omega` in one call. `omega` reasons over the (in)equalities as opaque
linear-arithmetic atoms; it never performs `Eq.mpr`-style term substitution, so it is immune to the
dependent-type occurrence that breaks `rw`/`Eq.mpr`. Concretely: keep `hscrew : screwDim 2 = 6` and
`hcard : Nat.card V = Fintype.card V` as plain hypotheses in context (no `rw [hscrew]`/`rw [hcard]`
anywhere) and close the goal with a single `omega` that also sees the rank-nullity / domination
facts.

**Worked case:** `SimpleGraph.molecule_rank_lower_bound` (`Molecular/Molecule/Application.lean`,
Phase 26 leaf `lem:molecule-rank-lower-bound`) — both `rw [← hscrew, ← hrank']` (to build an
intermediate `hker`) and the final `rw [hcard]` before closing hit this, because the goal's
`G.shadowGraph.deficiency 3` carries `G.shadowGraph`'s label type `Fin (6 * (Nat.card V - 1) + 1)`
as an implicit argument. Dropping both `rw`s and calling `omega` once over
`hkey`/`hrank'`/`hscrew`/`hrn`/`hdom`/`hcard` closed it immediately.

## 78. Narrowing a producer's `∃`-conjunct count leaves a *sibling* call site's `obtain`/`refine` tuple stale — the build's `rcases`/tuple-arity error is the reliable catch, not exhaustive-looking grep

**Symptom.** After editing a producer theorem's statement to drop one `∃`-conjunct (e.g. a
rationality clause `(Q.coeffs ⊆ range …) ∧` sitting between two other conjuncts), a build several
files away from the edit fails with

```
error: … Tactic `rcases` failed: `right✝ : ∀ q, … → …` is not an inductive datatype
```

naming the *tail* of the destructured tuple as the offending "inductive datatype" — a telltale
sign the `obtain`/`refine` pattern still expects one more component than the (now-narrower) type
actually returns.

**Cause.** A single producer can have *several* call sites inside the *same* file (not just one
per file), and a file-by-file sweep tracking "have I edited this file's uses of producer `X`" can
tick a file off after fixing the site it happened to be looking at, without registering that the
*same producer name* recurs elsewhere in that same file. Grepping for the discard-pattern
`⟨…, _, …⟩` alone doesn't catch it either: a stale site that still names *every* slot (no `_`
placeholder at all, just one variable too many) doesn't match a `_`-keyed grep and reads, on a
quick skim, like a site that was "already handled" because it looks structurally like the fixed
ones.

**Fix.** After editing a producer's statement, do one final `grep -rn '<producer name>'` across the
*whole* tree (not per-file) and enumerate **every** result that is an actual application (not a
docstring mention) before considering the sweep done — cross-check the count of call sites found
against the count of `obtain`/`refine`/`exact` tuples fixed. The build's `rcases`-arity error is a
reliable backstop (it fires precisely and names the excess conjunct), but relying on it to *find*
missed sites costs a `lake build` round-trip per miss; a final whole-tree grep pass is instant.

**Worked case:** Phase 30 RELAX slice (e) (`notes/Phase30.md`) — narrowing
`PanelHingeFramework.exists_rankPolynomial_of_IH_linking`'s `∃ N, … ∧ ∃ Q, Q≠0 ∧ (coeffs…) ∧ …` to
drop the middle conjunct broke two `obtain ⟨N, hNeq, P_ab, hP_abne, _, hP_abtrans⟩ := …` sites in
`Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/CaseIII/Realization.lean` (`case_III_candidate_dispatch` and
`chainData_split_w6b_gates`) that a first pass missed — both call the same producer the just-edited
`exists_nested_rankPolynomial_lower_all_k` also calls, in the same file, and the miss surfaced only
at the next full `lake build`.

## 79. A data-producing `def` built with `obtain`/`rcases`/`cases` blocks the returned record's field-projection from reducing — `(foo …).m = 3` fails by `rfl`, and a downstream `exact`/`hm`-argument won't unify

**Symptom.** A `def foo … : SomeStructure := by … exact { field₁ := 3, … }` builds and its fields
prove fine, but a later `(foo …).field₁ = 3 := rfl` fails

```
error: Not a definitional equality: the left-hand side
  (foo …).field₁ is not definitionally equal to the right-hand side  3
```

and passing a proof of the *reduced* form where `(foo …).field₁ ≤ n` is expected fails with an
`Application type mismatch` (`3 ≤ n` vs `(foo …).field₁ ≤ n`).

**Cause.** `obtain`/`rcases`/`cases` (and 4-slot `obtain ⟨a, b, c, d⟩` on a nested `∧`) compile to
`And.casesOn`/`Exists.casesOn`/`.rec`. A `casesOn` on an **opaque scrutinee** (a theorem
application like `exists_isLink_…`, not a literal constructor) does **not** reduce, so the returned
`{ field₁ := 3, … }` sits *inside* the un-reduced `casesOn` and its projections are stuck — even
`field₁`, whose value doesn't depend on the destructured data at all. (An `∃` also cannot be
destructured into a `Type`-valued goal at all: *"recursor `Exists.casesOn` can only eliminate into
`Prop`"* — use `.choose`/`.choose_spec`.)

**Fix.** Keep the structure literal at the **head** of the term: bind the producer's output with
`have h := …` and take **projections** (`h.1`, `h.2.1`, `h.2.2`) rather than `obtain`; use
`set f := h.2.2.choose with hfdef` / `let` (both zeta-reducible) for any *data* field, and `have`
(a `letFun`, beta-reducible) for *Prop* fields. Then `(foo …).field₁` reduces through the
`letFun`/`let` chain to the literal `3` by `rfl`, and `exact (h : 3 ≤ n)` unifies against the
`… ≤ n` slot directly (add a `@[simp] theorem foo_field₁ … : (foo …).field₁ = 3 := rfl` if callers
want to `rw` it). Note this is *not* about `noncomputable` — `.choose` makes the def noncomputable,
but that never affects reducibility; the culprit is purely the `casesOn`.

**Worked case:** Phase 31 (`Graph.CycleData.ofCardThree`, the `|V|=3` triangle→`3`-cycle
constructor, `Molecular/Induction/Operations.lean`): the first draft used
`obtain ⟨hab, hVeq, hfex⟩ := exists_isLink_of_isMinimalKDof_card_three …`, which made
`(ofCardThree …).m = 3` non-defeq and broke the `cycle_realization … hn3` call at
`Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/CaseIII/Arms.lean` (`hn3 : 3 ≤ n` vs the `.m ≤ n` slot). Switching to
`have hdata := …; have hab := hdata.1; … ; set f := hdata.2.2.choose` restored the reduction and
`ofCardThree_m := rfl`.

## 80. `rw [Fintype.card_coe]` fails after unfolding a Finset-indexed clique/induced-subgraph fact — the vertex type is the *Set*-coercion's coe-sort, not the Finset's own coe-sort

**Symptom.** Bridging `SimpleGraph.IsClique (↑X : Set V)` (`X : Finset V`) through
`isClique_iff_induce_eq` / `ncard_edgesIn_eq_ncard_induce_edgeSet` to
`ncard_edgeSet_top_eq_card_choose_two` lands a goal of the shape
`(Fintype.card ↥(↑X : Set V)).choose 2 = X.card.choose 2`. `rw [Fintype.card_coe]` — which states
`Fintype.card ↥X = X.card` for `X`'s *own* `CoeSort` — fails with `"Did not find an occurrence of
the pattern Fintype.card ↥?s"`. The goal's `↥(↑X : Set V)` (`Set`-coercion coe-sort) and `↥X`
(`Finset`'s own coe-sort) are two different terms; `Finset.coe_sort_coe` proves them `rfl`-equal,
but `rw`'s pattern search is syntactic (up to reducible unfolding), not full defeq, so it never
sees the two coe-sorts as the same pattern to match against.

**Fix.** Close with a plain `simp` (its simp-set normalizes through `Finset.coe_sort_coe` /
`Fintype.card_coe` together) instead of a targeted `rw`.

**Worked case:** `SimpleGraph.IsClique.ncard_edgesIn` (`EdgesIn.lean`, Phase 32
`sec:jacobs-laman3` slice — the clique-edge-count lemma feeding Jackson–Jordán Lemma 5.2's
degree-at-most-three bound, `IsLaman3.degree_le_three` in `Jacobs.lean`).

## 81. A rigid `Eq`-typed proof term as an `Or.inr`/anonymous-constructor argument fails against a `Set`-membership goal when the target *set* is an unconstrained implicit

**Symptom.** Calling a lemma like `mem_crossingEdgesWithin_shadowGraph {S : Set α} (hxy : Adj x y)
(hx : f x ∈ S) (hy : f y ∈ S) …` — where `S` is not pinned by any *other* argument — with
`hy := Set.mem_insert_iff.mpr (Or.inr hfuw.symm)` (`hfuw.symm : f y = f a`, aiming for `f y ∈ {f b,
f a}`) fails with `Application type mismatch: … has type f y = f a but is expected to have type f y
∈ ?m` even though the term is definitionally exactly what a singleton membership unfolds to.
Swapping `hfuw.symm` for `rfl` in the same position succeeds. The difference: `rfl`'s type `?a =
?a` unifies with *any* pending metavariable, so it happily defers `S`'s resolution to later
unification steps; a already-elaborated `Eq` term like `hfuw.symm : f y = f a` is rigid, and
checking it against `f y ∈ ?m` (still a bare metavariable — `Set.mem_insert_iff.mpr`'s recursive
call to `Or.inr` hasn't been told what the singleton tail is) requires unfolding `∈`/`Set.instInsert`
through the *unresolved* `?m`, which elaboration will not do speculatively.

**Fix.** Pin the implicit explicitly at the call site, e.g. `mem_crossingEdgesWithin_shadowGraph
(S := {f v, f u}) hxy hx hy`, so `S` (hence the expected membership type of each argument) is known
*before* `hy`'s term is elaborated. A `by` tactic block for the same argument (goal type is fixed
by the ascription before any tactic runs) is an equally safe alternative to a term-mode
`Or.inr`/anonymous-constructor chain when the target isn't otherwise pinned.

**Worked case:** `SimpleGraph.IsSquareTightPartition.not_adj_adj_of_same_part` /
`.not_adj_triangle` (`JacobsCounting.lean`, Phase 32 `sec:jacobs-counting` — the shadow-transported
pair-multiplicity / three-part-subfamily lemmas for `lem:singleton-part-neighborhood`).

## 82. `rw [foo_iff_bar, baz_univ_iff]` applied to *both sides* of a goal `Iff` fails on the second
occurrence when only one side is actually shaped for the second lemma

**Symptom.** Proving `G.EdgeSetRowIndependent p Set.univ ↔ (⊤ : SimpleGraph V).EdgeSetRowIndependent
p I` (`I` an arbitrary — not `Set.univ` — subset) via `rw [edgeSetRowIndependent_iff_linearIndepOn,
linearIndepOn_univ_iff, edgeSetRowIndependent_iff_linearIndepOn, linearIndepOn_univ_iff]` (unfolding
each side, then specializing `LinearIndepOn … Set.univ` to `LinearIndependent …` on each) fails at
the *second* `linearIndepOn_univ_iff`: `rw` rewrote the *first* occurrence of
`edgeSetRowIndependent_iff_linearIndepOn` fine (turning the LHS `Set.univ`-indexed side into
`LinearIndepOn … Set.univ`, then the first `linearIndepOn_univ_iff` simplified that to
`LinearIndependent …`), but the RHS after its own `edgeSetRowIndependent_iff_linearIndepOn` rewrite
is `LinearIndepOn … I` for the arbitrary `I` — no `Set.univ` pattern anywhere for the *second*
`linearIndepOn_univ_iff` to match, so it fails outright ("did not find an occurrence").

**Fix.** Don't reuse the same rewrite list symmetrically across an `Iff`'s two sides when the
two sides aren't shaped alike — apply `linearIndepOn_univ_iff` (or any lemma keyed to a specific
literal argument, here `Set.univ`) only where that literal genuinely occurs, then `change` the
goal to the exact unfolded target for the other side (`LinearIndepOn`'s definitional unfolding to
`LinearIndependent ℝ (fun x : I => f x.val)` is by `rfl`, so `change` accepts it silently) rather
than chasing a matching `rw` lemma that doesn't exist for that shape.

**Worked case:** `SimpleGraph.edgeSetRowIndependent_univ_iff_top` (`RigidityMatroid.lean`, Phase 32
S3 — the graph-relative ↔ ambient-`⊤`-relative row-independence reindexing feeding
`cor:zero-extension-degree-le-three`'s lower bound).

## 83. Extracting a subset of `G.neighborSet v` via `Set.toFinset` + an ad-hoc `Fintype.ofFinite` instance fails ("failed to synthesize `Fintype ↑(G.1 v)`") — go through `neighborFinset` instead

**Symptom.** Wanting three neighbours of `v`, you write `haveI : Fintype (G.neighborSet v) :=
Fintype.ofFinite _` and work through `(G.neighborSet v).toFinset` /
`Finset.exists_subset_card_eq` / `Set.mem_toFinset`. The `haveI` and the `.card` bridge elaborate
fine, but a later `Set.mem_toFinset.mp (htsub hu)` fails with *"failed to synthesize instance
`Fintype ↑(G.1 v)`"*. The set `G.neighborSet v` is `↥{w | G.Adj v w}`, and `Set.mem_toFinset`
re-synthesises `[Fintype ↥s]` against the **unfolded** `↑(G.Adj v)` (`= ↑(G.1 v)`) form; the ad-hoc
`Fintype.ofFinite _` instance is keyed on the *folded* `G.neighborSet v`, so it never matches.

**Fix.** Provide `[Fintype V]` + `[DecidableRel G.Adj]` (`Fintype.ofFinite V` / `Classical.decRel _`)
and go through the canonical `G.neighborFinset v` with its own generic API: `coe_neighborFinset`
(+ `Set.ncard_coe_finset`) to bridge `(G.neighborFinset v).card = (G.neighborSet v).ncard`, and
`mem_neighborFinset` for membership (`w ∈ G.neighborFinset v ↔ G.Adj v w`). These lemmas quantify
over `[Fintype (G.neighborSet v)]`, so they fire under whatever instance is in scope and never
re-key against the unfolded set. General rule: to enumerate / subset a `neighborSet`, reach for
`neighborFinset` + its API, not `Set.toFinset` on the set with a hand-rolled `Fintype`.

**Worked case:** `SimpleGraph.zero_extension_genericRank_add_min_le` (`JacobsZeroExtension.lean`,
Phase 32 S4 — picking three neighbours to restrict a `0`-extension's star to degree three).

## 84. `[Fintype V]` alone does not give `Fintype (G.neighborSet v)` — `G.degree v` in a signature also needs `[DecidableRel G.Adj]` (or a per-vertex `[Fintype (G.neighborSet v)]`)

**Symptom.** A `theorem` signature that mentions `G.degree v` (or `{w | G.degree w = 1}`,
quantified over every `w : V`) under `variable [Fintype V]` alone fails to elaborate with
*"failed to synthesize instance `Fintype ↑(G.neighborSet v)`"* — even though `degree` "should"
be computable once the vertex type is finite. `SimpleGraph.degree` is `def degree [Fintype
(G.neighborSet v)] : ℕ := #(G.neighborFinset v)`: the instance argument is *per-vertex*, and
`[Fintype V]` gives no automatic bridge to it. There is no registered `Finite → Fintype`
instance in mathlib (`Fintype.ofFinite` is a `noncomputable def`, not tagged `instance`,
precisely to avoid diamond issues from silently picking a canonical enumeration) — nor is
`Set`-membership decidability free: `Fintype (G.neighborSet v)` needs `DecidableRel G.Adj` to
turn `{w | G.Adj v w}` into a decidable-predicate subtype, which mathlib's `Finite.lean` then
turns into a `Fintype` (the (deprecated-name, but real) `neighborSetFintype` instance).

**Fix.** Add `[DecidableRel G.Adj]` alongside `[Fintype V]` whenever a signature needs
`G.degree w` for a *universally quantified* `w` (a set-builder like `{w | G.degree w = 1}`, or
a lemma parametrized over an arbitrary vertex) — this combination gives `Fintype (G.neighborSet
w)` automatically for every `w`. For a *single* named vertex, an explicit `[Fintype (G.neighborSet
v)]` instance argument (mathlib's own `Finite.lean` style, e.g. `degree_eq_one_iff_existsUnique_adj`)
is lighter and keeps the statement's typeclass footprint minimal — prefer it when only one or two
vertices are actually named in the statement.

**Worked case:** `SimpleGraph.setOf_degree_eq_one_deleteIncidenceSet_of_three_le_degree` /
`…_of_degree_eq_two` (`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/DeleteEdges.lean` project mirror, Phase 32
L2 slice T2 — the degree-one-vertex-set identities across a leaf peel, which need `G.degree w`
at an arbitrary `w`, vs. the single-vertex `degree_deleteIncidenceSet_of_ne_of_ne` etc. alongside
them, which use the per-vertex explicit-instance form instead).

## 85. Dropping a leaf `module` file's `public import` of a base-type module breaks a not-yet-migrated downstream file that used the notation only via transitive re-export

**Symptom.** Mid-way through an incremental field-generalization sweep (ℝ → a general field `K`,
one file per slice), converting a leaf file and dropping its now-unneeded `public import
Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic` makes an *unrelated, not-yet-converted* downstream file fail with
*"Unknown identifier `ℝ`"* / *"It is not possible to treat `ℝ` as an implicitly bound variable here
because the `autoImplicit` option is set to `false`"* — even though that downstream file's own
source is untouched and still genuinely uses `ℝ`.

**Cause.** The project's module system (`module` + `public import` + `@[expose] public section`)
re-exports a `public import`ed module's public interface — including notations like `ℝ` — to every
further `public import`er, *transitively*. A leaf file supplying `ℝ` only via its own `public
import Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic` was silently handing that notation down the whole `public import`
chain; any downstream file that used `ℝ` directly but never imported `Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic`
itself was relying on this re-export without knowing it. Generalizing the leaf away from `ℝ` (and
correctly dropping the now-unused import) breaks every such downstream file that hasn't been
converted yet.

**Fix.** Add the dropped import directly to each affected not-yet-migrated file, in the *same*
commit as the leaf's generalization — this is a forced, temporary boundary-compilation repair, not
scope creep: it is the import-level instance of the same "boundary files must keep compiling at
every slice" invariant a field-generalization sweep already has to honor for typeclass hypotheses
(pinning a literal `ℝ`/`[Field ℝ]` at every not-yet-swept call site). The added import comes back
out once that downstream file's own slice converts it to the general type and it no longer needs
the concrete notation.

**Worked case:** Phase 33 Slice 2 (`Molecular/Extensor.lean` ℝ → `K`) dropped `Mathlib.Data.Real.
Basic`. `Molecular/Meet.lean` (Slice 3, not yet converted) uses `ℝ` directly throughout but had
never imported `Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic` itself, relying on Extensor's transitive re-export;
`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean` regained `ℝ` for free once Meet.lean's own import was restored, since it
in turn `public import`s Meet.lean (confirming the re-export is transitive, not just one hop). Fixed
by adding `public import Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic` to `Meet.lean`.

**Recurrence (Slice 3):** converting `Molecular/Meet.lean` itself and dropping *its* now-unneeded
`Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic` broke `RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean` the same way (still ℝ-hardwired,
Slice 4's target) — the whole `RigidityMatrix.Basic` module cascaded into dozens of "Unknown
identifier `ℝ`" errors from one dropped import. Same fix, same file each hop: add `public import
Mathlib.Data.Real.Basic` directly to `RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`; it drops out again once Slice 4
converts that file's own `ℝ` to `K`. Confirms the pattern recurs at every hop of a multi-file sweep,
not just once at the seam — check the next not-yet-swept importer's own imports before declaring a
slice done.

## 86. Generalizing a `def`'s base ring from a concrete `ℝ` to an abstract `[Field K]` can turn a previously-computable definition noncomputable at its `K := ℝ` call sites

**Symptom.** Mid-way through the same kind of ℝ → `K` sweep, a downstream `def` (not `noncomputable
def`) that builds a value by calling another `def` whose ring hypothesis was just generalized from
concrete `ℝ` to `[Field K]` fails to compile with *"failed to compile definition, consider marking
it as `noncomputable` because it depends on `Real.instField`, which is `noncomputable`"* — even
though the exact same downstream code, calling the old ℝ-hardwired version of that dependency,
compiled fine as a plain `def` before.

**Cause.** Instantiating a generic `[Field K]` (or `[CommRing K]`) hypothesis at `K := ℝ` resolves
the needed ring structure via the forgetful `Field.toCommRing` (etc.) chain, i.e. through
`Real.instField` — `noncomputable`, since ℝ's `Inv` cannot be computed. An ℝ-hardwired `def`
resolves the same structure through a different, more direct instance (`Real.instCommRing` /
`Real.instRing`) that does not route through `Field ℝ` at all, and is computable. The two paths are
propositionally the same ring but reach it via different instance terms, and only one is
executable.

**Fix.** Mark the affected `def` `noncomputable def`. This changes no statement (the signature and
proof obligations are identical), so it needs no blueprint restatement — only a `\lean{...}`-pinned
node whose *statement* changes needs the structural-edit-gate TeX update.

**Worked case:** Phase 33 Slice 2 generalized `Molecular/Extensor.lean`'s `extensor` /
`affineSubspaceExtensor` to `[Field K]`. `RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`'s `ofHinge` (still ℝ-pinned;
calls `affineSubspaceExtensor` at `K := ℝ` inside a `ScrewSpace.mk`) stopped compiling as a plain
`def`; fixed by `noncomputable def ofHinge …`.

## 87. Generalizing a function's base ring from concrete `ℝ` to `[Field K]` strands a caller theorem whose *own statement* never textually mentions the new type parameter

**Symptom.** Mid-way through the same ℝ → `K` sweep, a theorem that merely names a previously-swept
function by *non-`K`* arguments — e.g. `Function.Injective (wedgePairing k hj)`, where `k : ℕ` and
`hj : j ≤ k + 2` carry no field content — fails with *"typeclass instance problem is stuck: `Field
?m.11`"* (the Note explains Lean won't resolve an instance whose type argument is a bare
metavariable). Fixing that one spot can still leave a **second**, more confusing failure one level
in: a term like `exact (helper_lemma hj S) (proof)`, where `helper_lemma`'s own explicit arguments
(`hj : j ≤ k + 2`, `S : Set.powersetCard (Fin (k+2)) j`) *also* carry no `K` content, throws a "Type
mismatch" between the elaborated proof's (correctly `K`-typed) type and an expected type still
carrying a bare metavariable for `K` — because that particular call's own implicit `K` was never
pinned either. Left unfixed, both shapes can cascade into "Unknown identifier" (a sibling decl that
depended on the stuck one) and even `(kernel) unknown constant` errors much later in the file.

**Cause.** A theorem's own `[Field K]` (and any other section variable) is auto-included in its
signature **only if `K` occurs as a literal token somewhere in that signature's surface syntax**
(directly, or via an explicit argument whose *stated* type mentions it) — this is a syntactic
closure over the *written* header, not a semantic one over whatever the body eventually needs. A
theorem like `wedgePairing_injective {j : ℕ} (hj : j ≤ k + 2) : Function.Injective (wedgePairing k
hj)` never writes `K` anywhere, even though `wedgePairing`'s *codomain* depends on it — so `K` is
simply absent from this decl's local context, and elaborating `wedgePairing k hj` inserts a fresh,
totally unconstrained metavariable for it. The same happens **inside** an already-fixed theorem's
*proof*, one level down, whenever it fully applies a *different* K-generic lemma using only
arguments that don't mention `K` (an `ℕ`/`Fin`-indexed hypothesis and a `Set.powersetCard` witness,
here) — that particular application gets its own fresh `K` metavariable, independent of the
enclosing theorem's already-resolved one, and nothing at that call site pins it.

Before the sweep this was invisible: `ℝ` was a concrete type, not an implicit argument to infer, so
none of these call sites needed to determine anything.

**Fix.** Add a literal `K` token to the ambiguous spot so auto-inclusion (or ordinary unification)
has something to bind: annotate the call `(K := K)` — e.g. `Function.Injective (wedgePairing (K :=
K) k hj)`, or `wedgePairing_ιMulti_family_compl_ne_zero (K := K) hj S` at an inner call site. This
is cheap and purely additive (no statement or proof-structure change), so it needs no blueprint
restatement of its own. **Recognize the pattern early:** any theorem in a just-generalized file
whose stated type names a sibling `K`-generic function/lemma by ℕ/`Fin`/`Set`-only explicit
arguments is a candidate — check it before the build surfaces the stuck-metavariable error, not
after.

**Worked case:** Phase 33 Slice 3 (`Molecular/Meet.lean` ℝ → `K`). `wedgePairing_injective`'s own
statement needed `(K := K)` on its `wedgePairing k hj` mention; its proof body then needed a second
`(K := K)` on its call to `wedgePairing_ιMulti_family_compl_ne_zero hj S` (and a third on
`wedgePairing_ιMulti_family_eq_zero_of_ne_compl hj S' T this`) before the stuck-metavariable /
type-mismatch pair cleared. **Slice-4 recurrence (the downstream `(K := ℝ)` variant):** the same
sweep's fan-out into the *still-ℝ-hardwired* files struck at a handful of proof-body sites where the
now-`K`-generic `screwDiff` / `columnOp` / `hingeRow` / `finrank_screwAssignment` / `screwDiff_surjective`
is applied by ℕ/`Fin`-only arguments inside a `have hinj : Function.Injective (screwDiff (k := k) …)`,
a `set Φ := columnOp (k := k) …`, or a bare `rw [← finrank_screwAssignment (k := k) …]` — none of
which surface `K` — fixed with `(K := ℝ)` (Bricks, Pinning, GenericityDevice, CaseIII/Candidate).
Concrete's ~60 such call sites all resolved `K` from a neighbouring `Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace ℝ k)`,
so only the type-ascription-free spots stuck. **Slice-6 recurrence (the matrix-product `HMul`-deferral
shape — 36 `columnOp` sites, sharper than the Slice-4 prediction above):** sweeping `Concrete.lean`
itself ℝ → `K`, every `columnOp (k := k) hva` factor of a matrix product `rigidityMatrix{Prod,Edge} *
(toMatrix' (prodColumnOpEquiv … (columnOp (k := k) hva).symm))ᵀ` stuck, because `columnOp`'s header
(`{v a : α} (hva : v ≠ a)`) never names `K`. The distinctive symptom is *not* the stuck-`Field ?m`
form but **`Function expected at <the product>, but this term has type ?m.NN`** — matrix `HMul`
synthesis defers while `K` is a bare metavar, so the product's *type* stays an unresolved metavar and
the subsequent entry application `(…) p (body, c)` reads it as a non-function; the same root cascades
one decl over into `.toBlocks₁₂`/`.toBlocks₂₂` "Type mismatch" / "failed to synthesize `HMul (Matrix
m₁ m₂ K) …`". It bites in *statement* positions where the product is applied to indices (`(…) p (body,
c)`); the sibling sites that wrap the product in `.submatrix re en` / `.row p` (which supply the
`Matrix _ _ _` expected type) resolved fine. Fixed uniformly with `columnOp (K := K) (k := k) hva`
(36 sites; harmless where `K` already inferred). The 9-char pin overran the 100-col limit on 3
proof-body `rw` lines — rewrap `p body c,` onto a continuation line.

## 88. Generalizing a carrier `def X (k) : Type := ↥(…)` from concrete `ℝ` to `[Field K]` leaves a wrong `: Type` (universe 0) ascription that surfaces as a later universe-mismatch defeq failure

**Symptom.** After generalizing a carrier `def X (k : ℕ) : Type := ↥(⋀[ℝ]^k (Fin (k+2) → ℝ))` to
`def X (K : Type*) [Field K] (k : ℕ) : Type := ↥(⋀[K]^k (Fin (k+2) → K))`, a `change` / `rw` / defeq
that worked verbatim over ℝ now fails, e.g.

```
'change' tactic failed, pattern
  Module.finrank.{u_1, u_1} K ↥(⋀[K]^k (Fin (k + 2) → K)) = screwDim k
is not definitionally equal to target
  Module.finrank.{u_1, 0} K (X K k) = screwDim k
```

The two `Module.finrank`s differ **only in the second universe level** — `u_1` on the unfolded side,
`0` on the carrier side. The def itself elaborates without complaint; the mismatch only bites
downstream when something tries to unfold `X K k` to its graded-piece body.

**Cause.** The original `: Type` ascription (= `Type 0`) was *correct* at `ℝ`, because
`↥(⋀[ℝ]^k …) : Type 0` (`ℝ : Type 0`). Over an abstract `K : Type u_1` the body
`↥(⋀[K]^k (Fin (k+2) → K))` lives in `Type u_1`, but the explicit `: Type` pins the *declared*
carrier at universe 0. So `X K k` (declared `Type 0`) is no longer at the same universe as its own
unfolding (`Type u_1`), and any defeq that must reduce through the carrier reports
`.{u_1, 0}` vs `.{u_1, u_1}`.

**Fix.** Drop the `: Type` result ascription entirely (`def X (K : Type*) [Field K] (k : ℕ) := ↥(…)`,
letting Lean infer `Type u_1`), or write `: Type _`. **Rule:** when generalizing *any* `def` that
returns a type from concrete `ℝ` to `[Field K]`, a literal `: Type` that was right at `ℝ` (universe 0)
is wrong at abstract `K` (universe `u`) — infer it or use `Type _`.

**Worked case:** Phase 33 Slice 4 (`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean` `ScrewSpace` ℝ→K). `screwSpace_finrank`'s
leading `change Module.finrank K ↥(⋀[K]^k …) = …` failed with exactly the `.{u_1, u_1}`/`.{u_1, 0}`
mismatch until `def ScrewSpace (K : Type*) [Field K] (k : ℕ) : Type` dropped its `: Type`.

## 89. An ℝ→K sweep leaves *proof-internal* uses of ℝ's characteristic-0 / ordered structure that no signature change reveals — a hard-coded nonzero numeral, or `linarith`/`positivity`

**Symptom.** After ℝ→K generalizes a decl, its *body* (which typechecked verbatim over ℝ) fails:

- `⟨2, two_ne_zero, h2⟩` (or `(2 : K) ≠ 0` as a `by norm_num`/instance goal) — *"failed to
  synthesize `NeZero (2 : K)`"* / `two_ne_zero` unsolved. In characteristic 2, `2 = 0`, so the
  numeral candidate is degenerate; the fact is **false over general `K`**, not just unprovable.
- `linarith [...]` / `nlinarith` / `positivity` on a goal about **field scalars** (`a * b + c = 0`
  in `K`) — *"linarith failed to find a contradiction"*. `linarith` needs a `LinearOrderedField`;
  a general `K` has no order. (Goals about ℕ/ℤ **dimension counts** — `finrank`, `screwDim`,
  `.ncard` — keep working: those stay over ordered ℤ/ℕ, not `K`.)

**Cause.** Concrete `ℝ` is characteristic 0 **and** ordered, so a proof could silently use `2 ≠ 0`
or `linarith` on real scalars. The signature generalizes cleanly (§ 87), but these are **proof-body**
uses that only surface when the body re-elaborates over abstract `K` — invisible to `checkdecls`,
the numeric-tactic grep audit is what catches them (any `(n : K) ≠ 0`-shaped goal or field-scalar
`linarith` is the tell).

**Fix.**
- **Numeral picks:** replace "pick a nonzero scalar avoiding a small bad set" that hard-codes
  `t = 1, 2, …` with an infinite-field extraction. Thread `[Infinite K]` (per-decl, matching the
  threaded field-hypothesis decision), show the bad set ∪ `{0}` is finite, and pull a point out of
  its complement: `obtain ⟨t, ht⟩ := (Set.infinite_univ (α := K)).diff hfin |>.nonempty`, then
  `simp only [Set.mem_diff, …, not_or, not_not] at ht`. This is char-free (holds in *every* infinite
  field, any characteristic), which is exactly the phase's headline hypothesis.
- **Order tactics:** a linear/polynomial field-scalar identity closes with `linear_combination h`
  (from the hypothesis the old `linarith [...]` was fed) or `ring`/`field_simp`; there is no ordered
  structure to appeal to.

**Worked case:** Phase 33 Slice 8 (`AlgebraicInduction/PanelLayer.lean` ℝ→K).
`exists_shear_linearIndependent_pair` picked `t ∈ {1, 2}` outside a subsingleton bad set
(`two_ne_zero` — char-2-false); rerouted to `[Infinite K]` + the `Set.infinite_univ.diff` extraction
above. Separately, `normalsJoin_pair_linearIndependent_of_triLI`'s
`linarith [mul_add s₂ (c₁ * n_a i) (c₂ * n_b i)]` (a bilinearity identity) became `linear_combination
hi`. No downstream caller of the shear lemma broke — `Infinite ℝ` is a global instance, so still-ℝ
callers auto-discharge the new `[Infinite K]`.

## 90. `rw [neg_one_smul]` (bare, no args) fails to find `(-1 : R) • x` even though it is syntactically present — pass the ring/term explicitly, or use `module`

**Symptom.** A goal is visibly `(-1 : K) • x = -x` (or a sub-step producing exactly that shape after
prior rewrites), yet `rw [neg_one_smul]` reports *"Did not find an occurrence of the pattern `-1 •
?x`"*. `exact neg_one_smul K _` also fails, but with a *different* error — *"typeclass instance
problem is stuck: Module K ?m"* — because the `_` leaves the module `M` a metavariable with nothing
to unify it against before instance search runs.

**Cause.** `neg_one_smul`'s signature (`Mathlib/Algebra/Module/Defs.lean`) has the ring `R` as an
**explicit** argument (a `variable (R)` switch just above its declaration), unlike most `smul`
lemmas where the ring is implicit and inferred from the acting term. When `rw`/`simp` build a
rewrite rule from `neg_one_smul` with no arguments supplied, they must synthesize the `[Ring R]
[AddCommGroup M] [Module R M]` instances for completely unconstrained metavariables *before* they
have anything from the goal to unify against, and typeclass search on totally free instance
metavariables does not "wait" for the pattern match the way it does for genuinely implicit
arguments — the rewrite search comes back empty instead of deferring. This is a narrower cousin of
the explicit-vs-implicit argument-inference gotchas already catalogued (§ 25, § 31): here the
symptom is a **silent pattern-match miss**, not a type mismatch.

**Fix.** Either supply the term fully (`exact neg_one_smul K (annihRow D t₁ t₂)` — a **concrete**
`x`, not `_`, so `M` and the instances resolve from the term itself) or sidestep the named lemma
entirely with the `module` tactic (`rw [← neg_one_smul K D, annihRow_smul]; module` closed
`(-1 : K) • annihRow D t₁ t₂ = -annihRow D t₁ t₂` instantly, where `rw [..., neg_one_smul]` as a
trailing rewrite did not). `module` is the general rescue for any goal that is a pure module-algebra
identity once the opaque function applications (`annihRow`, `panelSupportExtensor`, …) have already
been related by their own congruence lemmas (`annihRow_smul`) — it does not itself unfold those.

**Worked case:** `PanelHingeFramework.exists_independent_normalRow_of_le_finrank`'s `hAnegP`
helper (Phase 34, `Molecular/GenericLift/PanelGeneric.lean`) — proving `annihRow (-D) t₁ t₂ =
-annihRow D t₁ t₂` via `annihRow_smul` at `c := -1`. A second occurrence in the same theorem (closing
`-hingeRow … = (-1 : K) • normalRow …`) needed the fully-applied `neg_one_smul K (normalRow ends q
(e, t₁, t₂))` supplied as an explicit rewrite argument inside a larger `rw [...]` list — bare
`neg_one_smul` at the end of that same list failed exactly as above.
callers auto-discharge the new `[Infinite K]`.

## 91. `rw [iffLemma]` inside an `ite`'s condition fails "motive is not type correct" — use `simp only` instead

**Symptom.** A goal contains `if P then t else e` (or the same buried inside `EuclideanSpace.single`
/ `PiLp.single`'s unfolding), and `rw [hiff]` for some `hiff : P ↔ Q` (or `hiff : x = y ↔ P'`) fails
with *"motive is not type correct"*, the error naming a `Decidable _a` instance argument that no
longer matches `_a` after the rewrite (*"Application type mismatch: the argument `instDecidableEq…`
has type `Decidable P` but is expected to have type `Decidable _a`"*).

**Cause.** `ite`'s `Decidable` instance argument is **indexed by the very proposition** `P` that
`rw` is trying to abstract over to build its motive; rewriting `P` to `Q` inside the condition
requires the instance argument to change type in lockstep, which `rw`'s simple
`fun _a => …` motive-abstraction cannot express (the same underlying issue as the getElem-index
case, § 61, and the `Nat.card`/dependent-index case, § 77 — a rewrite target that is itself an
*index* into another part of the term).

**Fix.** Use `simp only [hiff]` (or fold `hiff` into a larger `simp only [...]` list) instead of
`rw`: `simp` carries `@[congr]` lemmas for `ite` that handle the `Decidable`-instance dependency
correctly, so it can rewrite inside the condition without the motive problem. This applies equally
when `hiff` is a project lemma stated as an `Iff` with an explicit side condition (`(hab : a < b) :
m = f ⟨(a,b), hab⟩ ↔ …`) — pass it to `simp only` and let simp unify the side condition against the
goal's own instance, rather than supplying it to `rw`.

**Worked case:** Phase 34, `BodyBar/GenericLift.lean`, `twoExtensor_coordPoint_zero`/`_succ`: the
private bridge lemma `pairIdxEquiv_eq_iff (hab : a < b) : m = pairIdxEquiv n ⟨(a,b),hab⟩ ↔
((pairIdxEquiv n).symm m).1 = (a,b)` was needed to rewrite the condition of the `ite` that
`PiLp.single_apply` produces (`if m = pairIdxEquiv n ⟨(0,k),hk⟩ then 1 else 0`); `rw
[pairIdxEquiv_eq_iff]` hit exactly this motive failure, `simp only […, pairIdxEquiv_eq_iff, …]`
did not.

## 92. `obtain`/`cases` on an expression not yet in the goal loses its connection to that expression — `set … with h` instead

**Symptom.** After `obtain ⟨⟨a, b⟩, hab⟩ := someEquiv.symm m` (destructuring an expression that
does not itself occur anywhere in the current goal), a later `have hm : m = someEquiv ⟨(a, b),
hab⟩ := (Equiv.apply_symm_apply someEquiv m).symm` fails with a *type mismatch* — the elaborator
does not accept that `someEquiv.symm m` and the destructured `⟨(a, b), hab⟩` are the same term,
even though they should be defeq.

**Cause.** `obtain`/`cases` on a bare expression works by `have`-introducing it under a fresh name
and then doing a genuine `casesOn`, which — unlike a `let` — does not reliably preserve the
zeta-transparency back to the original expression once the pattern's components (`a`, `b`, `hab`)
are named separately; the anonymous-constructor equality is *propositionally* true but not always
accepted by `exact`/`rfl` afterwards.

**Fix.** Use `set a := (someEquiv.symm m).1.1 with ha_def` / `set b := (someEquiv.symm m).1.2 with
hb_def` (projections, not a full destructure) instead of `obtain`. `set` introduces a genuine
`let`-bound local, so `a`/`b` stay zeta-transparent to their defining projections: `have hab : a < b
:= (someEquiv.symm m).2` and a subsequent `have hm : m = someEquiv ⟨(a, b), hab⟩ := (bridgeIffLemma
hab).mpr rfl` (§ 91's `pairIdxEquiv_eq_iff`-style bridge, discharged by a bare `rfl` on the
projections) both go through cleanly, where the `obtain`-then-reassemble route did not.

**Worked case:** Phase 34, `BodyBar/GenericLift.lean`,
`linearIndependent_twoExtensor_coordPoint`'s spanning argument: reconstructing `mIdx = pairIdxEquiv
n ⟨(a, b), hab⟩` from `a := ((pairIdxEquiv n).symm mIdx).1.1` / `b := …1.2` (via `set`) plus
`pairIdxEquiv_eq_iff hab |>.mpr rfl` replaced an initial `obtain ⟨⟨a, b⟩, hab⟩ := (pairIdxEquiv
n).symm mIdx` attempt that hit the type mismatch above.

## 93. A concrete framework-constructor `def F args := ⟨g, …⟩` (plain `where`/`⟨⟩` structure literal, not `@[reducible]`) fails `Application type mismatch` unifying a row family's `Subtype`-ascribed domain against `(F args).graph`, even though the two are `rfl`-defeq

**Symptom.** `LinearIndependent ℝ (fun e : (Subtype.val ⁻¹' E' : Set E(G)) => (F G args).rigidityRow
D e)` — a statement whose *type ascription* for `e` is spelled in terms of `G`, while `.rigidityRow
D` expects `E((F G args).graph)` — fails to elaborate:
```
Application type mismatch: The argument e has type ↑(Subtype.val ⁻¹' E') but is expected to have
type ↑E((F G args).graph) in the application (F G args).rigidityRow D e
```
even though `(F G args).graph = G` holds by `rfl` (the constructor's `graph` field literally *is*
`G`). Naming the restricted set as an earlier binder (`{s : Set ↥E(G)} … fun e : s => …`) does
**not** avoid it — the failure is about unifying the two *route*-to-`E(G)` spellings during
argument elaboration, not about where the ascription is written.

**Cause.** Structure-projection unfolding through a plain (non-`@[reducible]`) `def` is not
performed at the transparency the application-argument `isDefEq` check uses here, so `E(G)` (the
ascribed spelling) and `E((F G args).graph)` (the function's natural domain, needing one
`.graph`-projection unfold to reach `G`) are treated as distinct types and no coercion is found.

**Fix.** Mark the constructor `@[reducible]` — this is *already* the project's convention for
`BodyBar/GenericLift.lean`'s `mapPlacement`/`ofEndpoints`, just not yet lifted out of their inline
comments. Once reducible, the field-projection lemma's LHS (`(F G args).graph = G`) itself reduces
to the bare variable `G`, tripping `lake lint`'s `simpVarHead` if the lemma carries `@[simp]` — drop
the `@[simp]` tag (the fact stays callable by name); a `rw`/`simp only [foo_graph]` elsewhere in the
file may also become redundant and need trimming (`rw` closes by `rfl` mid-chain, leaving a
now-dead trailing tactic — *"no goals to be solved"*).

**Worked case:** Phase 34, `BodyBar/TayTheorem.lean`, `stdFramework_rigidityRow_linearIndependent_restrict`
/ `isSparse_of_isIndependent_restrict` (the `E'`-restricted generalizations of the unrestricted Tay
witness lemmas) — `stdFramework` needed the same `@[reducible]` treatment already applied to
`mapPlacement`/`ofEndpoints`, confirmed by an isolated `lean_run_code` repro before touching the real
file; `stdFramework_finrank_range`'s trailing `exact Fintype.card_congr (Equiv.refl _)` became dead
once the preceding `rw` chain started closing by `rfl`.

## 94. An implicit argument that is *only* determined by a later explicit argument, but also occurs (through a field projection) inside an *earlier* explicit argument's type, fails to unify — pin it by name

**Symptom.** A call `foo D M h` to a lemma
`theorem foo {F : SomeStructure} (D : Ty F.field) (M : …) {s} (h : LinearIndependent … (fun e : s => F.someFun D e)) : …`
— where `F` is implicit and would be uniquely determined by `h`'s type — fails with
`Application type mismatch`, reporting the expected type still full of unassigned metavariables
(`?m.NNN`) for `F`, `D`, *and* `s`, even though the value passed for `D` and the term passed for `h`
each individually look like they should pin `F`:
```
Application type mismatch: The argument h has type LinearIndependent … fun e ↦ (concreteF).someFun D e
but is expected to have type LinearIndependent (ι := ↑?m.712) … fun e ↦ someFun ?m.710 ?m.711 ↑e
```

**Cause.** `D`'s expected type (`Ty F.field`) mentions the metavariable `?F` only *applied to a
projection* (`F.field`, i.e. `SomeStructure.field ?F`) — not as a bare, directly-unifiable
metavariable. When `D` is elaborated (before `h`, since it comes first positionally), Lean cannot
invert `?F.field =?= (the type actually being passed)` to solve for `?F` (there are in general many
`F` with that one field value), so it defers. The deferred constraint does not always get
re-examined correctly once `h` later *would* pin `F` uniquely — the elaborator can give up with all
of `F`, `D`, and `s` still unassigned, rather than backtracking through the postponement.

**Fix.** Pin the implicit argument by name at the call site: `foo (F := concreteF) D M h`. This
removes the metavariable from `D`'s expected type before `D` is even elaborated, so nothing needs to
be deferred.

**Worked case:** Phase 34, `BodyBar/GenericLift.lean`,
`exists_endpoints_linearIndependent_rigidityRow`'s call to
`linearIndependent_rigidityRow_mapPlacement D M hLIstd` (`F` implicit, `D : Graph.orientation
F.graph`) — fixed by `linearIndependent_rigidityRow_mapPlacement (F := stdFramework G n j) D M
hLIstd`. The same shape recurs across this phase under different guises (Layer P's explicit `(K :=
K)` pin on a Theorem-55 witness call, and an explicit `∀ q`-type annotation on a corollary) — see
`notes/Phase34.md` *Decisions made*.

## 95. `ext m` on a `Module.Dual`/linear-map equality whose *domain* is a dependent function type (e.g. `Motion n α := α → EuclideanSpace …`) over-decomposes past the whole-argument level

**Symptom.** Proving `f = g` for `f g : (∀ i, M i) →ₗ[R] N` (concretely, two rigidity-row values in
`Module.Dual ℝ (Motion n α)`, `Motion n α := α → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`), `ext m` introduces *more*
variables than expected — not one `m : ∀ i, M i` matching `rigidityRow_apply`'s `(rigidityRow ?F ?D
?e) ?m` pattern, but `m : α` **and** a further anonymous `x✝ : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)` — leaving a
goal built from `∘ₗ LinearMap.single R M m` that no lemma about the whole-motion application
(`rigidityRow_apply`, `rigidityMap_apply`) matches, so the intended `rw [...]` chain fails to find
its pattern.

**Cause.** `ext` tries the most specific registered `@[ext]` lemma first. Since the domain `∀ i, M i`
is (reducibly) a Pi type, `ext` reaches for the Pi-decomposition linear-map ext lemma (splitting the
map per-component via `LinearMap.single`) instead of stopping at the coarser `LinearMap.ext` (`∀ x, f
x = g x`, one whole-argument variable). A single name given to `ext` does not stop it from chaining
further ext lemmas past that point (the extra binder is silently auto-named `x✝`).

**Fix.** Force the coarser lemma explicitly: `refine LinearMap.ext fun m => ?_` (introduces exactly
one `m` ranging over the whole domain type, matching `rigidityRow_apply`/`rigidityMap_apply`'s
stated form) instead of `ext m`.

**Worked case:** Phase 34, `BodyBar/GenericLift.lean`,
`exists_endpoints_linearIndependent_rigidityRow`'s `hrow_eq` step (proving
`((stdFramework G n j).mapPlacement M).rigidityRow D e = (ofEndpoints G q).rigidityRow D e` via
`rigidityRow_apply`/`rigidityMap_apply`/`mapPlacement_placement`) — `ext m` produced the
over-decomposed goal above; `refine LinearMap.ext fun m => ?_` fixed it. Distinct from § 9 (which is
about `ext`/`funext` on `EuclideanSpace` *itself*, the codomain-side gap): here the domain is a
genuine Pi type and the problem is `ext` doing *too much*, not too little.

## 96. `Fin.snoc f x` applied to a further index, inside `Matrix.of`, leaves `f`/`x` with unresolved
metavariables instead of unifying against the expected entry type

**Symptom.** `Matrix.of fun i j => Fin.snoc (fun b : Fin n => someTerm i b) (someConst)
(colIndex j)` — where `someTerm`/`someConst` both plainly have a fixed, non-dependent type `α` —
fails elaboration with `Type mismatch: Fin.snoc (fun b ↦ ?m.34) ?m.45 (colIndex j) has type
?m.20 (colIndex j) but is expected to have type α`. The same shape recurs one level down: a bare
`Fin.snoc (fun b => f b) x` on its own line (not further applied) can *also* fail, reporting
`Fin.snoc (fun b ↦ ?m.211) ?m.215 c has type ?m.200 c but is expected to have type α`.

**Cause.** `Fin.snoc {α : Fin (n+1) → Sort*} (p : ∀ i, α i.castSucc) (x : α (last n)) (i :
Fin (n+1)) : α i` is *dependently* typed — its motive `α` is an implicit `Fin (n+1) → Sort*`, not a
fixed type. When `p`/`x` are themselves non-dependent (constant-type) functions, Lean should infer
the constant motive `α := fun _ => (that type)` by higher-order unification, but inside a nested
elaboration context (an anonymous `fun i j => …` under `Matrix.of`, especially several `Fin.snoc`
arguments deep) the postponed metavariable for `α` sometimes isn't discharged before the whole
`Fin.snoc … (index)` application is checked against the expected entry type, producing the
dependent-in-name-only `?m.NNN (index)` mismatch above. `homogenize (p : Fin d → K) : Fin (d+1) → K
:= Fin.snoc p 1` (`Extensor.lean`) never hits this because it is its own top-level `def` with an
already-fixed return type at declaration time, not an inline `Fin.snoc` sitting inside a bigger
being-elaborated matrix comprehension.

**Fix.** Ascribe the *whole* `Fin.snoc p x` term's type explicitly before applying it to an index:
`(Fin.snoc p x : Fin (n+1) → α) (colIndex j)`. This pins the constant motive immediately, so no
metavariable survives into the outer `Matrix.of`/determinant elaboration.

**Worked case:** Phase 34, `Molecular/GenericLift/HingeGeneric.lean`, `hingeExtensorPoly` (the
polynomial Plücker-minor matrix `Matrix.of fun i j => Fin.snoc (fun b => X (e,i,b)) 1 (colIndex
j)`) and the `hingeExtensorPoly_eval` proof's inner `hcomm` helper (`Fin.snoc (fun b => X (e,i,b))
1` vs. `Fin.snoc (fun b => q (e,i,b)) 1`, each applied to a bound `c : Fin (k+2)`) — both needed the
`(… : Fin (k+2) → MvPolynomial … K)`/`(… : Fin (k+2) → K)` ascription to build; `homogenize`
(same `Fin.snoc p 1` shape, `Extensor.lean`) never needed one, for the reason above.

## 97. `f (S.field arg1) arg2 arg3` written as `f (S.field) arg1 arg2 arg3` — the missing inner parens
let the outer call swallow one argument too many, producing a confusing type error at the *last*
argument rather than an arity complaint

**Symptom.** `change f (S.field idx) t1 t2 = 0` (a `change`/`have`-stated goal for a 3-argument
function `f : C → I → I → R`, applied to a structure projection `S.field : ι → C` evaluated at
`idx`) written without the inner parens — `f S.field idx t1 t2 = 0` — fails with an
*"Application type mismatch"* naming the **last** written argument (`t1` had type `↑(some
index type)` but expected `ScrewSpace …`), not an arity/too-many-arguments complaint.

**Cause.** Juxtaposition is uniformly left-associative regardless of whether the first token
is a bare identifier or a `.field`-projected one: `f X idx t1 t2` parses as
`(((f X) idx) t1) t2`, so *all four* of `X`, `idx`, `t1`, `t2` become separate explicit
arguments to `f`, not `f` applied to the single already-complete term `X idx`. Once `f`'s three
declared explicit arguments (`C`, `I`, `I`) are consumed by `X`, `idx`, `t1`, the *result* — a
residual `Module.Dual`/function value — silently accepts one more juxtaposed argument (`t2`),
and Lean reports the type clash there instead of at the true point of failure. The dot notation
plays no special role in the parse; the bug is exactly the same as writing `f (g x) y z w` for a
3-arg `f` without parenthesizing `g x`.

**Fix.** Parenthesize the whole first-argument subterm: `f (S.field idx) t1 t2`. When the error
names the *last* explicit argument of a multi-arg call with an unrelated-looking expected type,
count the arguments actually being applied before hunting for a defeq bug — a missing inner paren
around a structure-projection-applied-to-an-index is the first thing to check.

**Worked case:** Phase 34, `Molecular/GenericLift/HingeGeneric.lean`,
`supportExtensor_ofHinge_ne_zero_of_isGenericHingePoints`'s closing `change` step —
`annihRow (ofHinge G (fun e' a b => q (e', a, b))).supportExtensor e tref t1 = 0` needed
`annihRow ((ofHinge G fun e' a b => q (e', a, b)).supportExtensor e) tref t1 = 0` instead; the
reported mismatch named `t1`'s type against `ScrewSpace K k`, not an arity error, because
`annihRow C t1 t2 : Module.Dual K (ScrewSpace K k)` happily consumed the fourth token before the
type clash surfaced.

## 98. `rw [heq]` on a `set`-bound variable (`heq : x = …`, `x` introduced by `set x := e`) → "motive is not type correct" — feed the equation to `omega`/`linarith` instead of rewriting the atom away

**Symptom.** After `set h' : ℕ := (…).ncard with hh'`, a later numeric goal is closed by
`rw [hcount, hScard, hfull, hbHM]; omega` where `hfull : h' = bodyHingeMult n` rewrites the
`set`-bound `h'`. The `rw` fails with `Tactic rewrite failed: motive is not type correct` (naming
the step that eliminates `h'`), even though `h'` is a plain `ℕ` and the abstracted motive looks
harmless.

**Cause.** `set x := e with hx` makes `x` a *let-bound* local (a local definition), and the many
context hypotheses that `set` folded (`hx`, and here `hScard`/`hfibpart`/… whose *types* now
mention `h'`) tie the goal's `h'` to that let-value. Generalizing the let-bound `x` out of the
goal for the rewrite produces a motive that is not type-correct against those dependencies. This
is the same family as §18/§43 — the difference is that here the offending variable is the `set`
atom *itself*, and you are rewriting it *away* (not folding *into* it).

**Fix.** Don't `rw` the `set` atom. Leave `h'` in the goal and let `omega`/`linarith` discharge:
they consume `hfull`, `hbHM`, `hScard`, … as ordinary linear hypotheses and treat `h'`,
`bodyHingeMult n`, `bodyBarDim n` as atoms — no motive abstraction, no failure. Concretely
`rw [hcount]; omega` (rewriting only the non-`set` `(⋃ Fs).ncard` term) closes what
`rw [hcount, hScard, hfull, hbHM]; omega` could not. Only `rw` equations whose LHS is an ordinary
(non-`set`) term; route every equation *about* a `set` variable through the arithmetic
tactic's hypothesis set.

**Worked case:** Phase 38 (FACTOR), `Molecular/Induction/ForestSurgery/EdgeSplitting.lean`,
`splitOff_reroute_packing`'s full-fiber count guard — `rw [hcountsum, hScard, hfull, hbHM]; omega`
tripped the motive check on the `hfull`/`h'` step; `rw [hcountsum]; omega` (with `hfull`/`hbHM`
in context) closes it.
