# CombinatorialRigidity

[![Build & deploy site](https://github.com/bryangingechen/CombinatorialRigidity/actions/workflows/push.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bryangingechen/CombinatorialRigidity/actions/workflows/push.yml)

A Lean 4 / mathlib4 formalization of combinatorial rigidity theory, working
toward **Laman's theorem** (1970): for `n ≥ 2`, a graph is generically rigid
in the plane iff it contains a `(2, 3)`-tight spanning subgraph. Phase 7
extends the development to the **Lovász–Yemini matroid identification**:
the planar rigidity matroid coincides with the `(2, 3)`-count matroid on
`E(K_V)`, packaged as a mathlib `Matroid` instance.

The development was originally hosted under `Archive/CombinatorialRigidity/`
in a fork of mathlib4 and has been lifted to this standalone, mathlib-downstream
project; commit history is preserved with paths rewritten.

## Project status

* **Phases 1–6 complete** — sparsity, Laman, Henneberg, frameworks,
  and both directions of Laman's theorem
  (`isGenericallyRigid_two_iff_exists_isLaman_le`). The project carries
  no `sorry`s; Laman's theorem is fully formalized.
* **Phase 7 in progress** — the Lovász–Yemini matroid identification.
  The hard direction (every `(2, 3)`-sparse subset of `E(K_V)` is
  row-independent at some planar placement) has landed; the matroid
  packaging via the general `(k, ℓ)`-count matroid (matroidal regime
  `ℓ < 2k`, Whiteley 1996 / Lee–Streinu 2008) is the closing step.
* **Phase 8 planned** — linear-matroid framing of the rigidity matroid
  via `apnelson1/Matroid`, with Lovász–Yemini stated as a matroid
  isomorphism.

See `ROADMAP.md` for the canonical hand-off doc — directory layout, status,
mathematical plan, and engineering conventions. `DESIGN.md` carries
cross-cutting design rationale; `TACTICS-GOLF.md` carries idiom / golfing guidance and `TACTICS-QUIRKS.md` covers build-failure rescue.
Per-phase work logs live under `notes/`.

`CLAUDE.md` is the operating manual for AI coding agents (Claude Code et al.)
— it covers reading order, the per-session workflow, the end-of-session
friction review, and the `notes/PhaseN.md` template. Human contributors can
skim it but the primary audience is automated tooling.

## Build

```
lake exe cache get   # fetch precompiled mathlib oleans (optional but fast)
lake build
```

Lean toolchain version is pinned in `lean-toolchain` and tracks mathlib.

## Blueprint

The mathematical blueprint lives under `blueprint/`. The web and PDF
versions are built and deployed automatically by GitHub Actions on every
push to `master` (see `.github/workflows/push.yml`); to build it locally:

```sh
cd blueprint
pip install -r requirements.txt
inv web     # plastex output in blueprint/web/
inv bp      # PDF in blueprint/print/print.pdf
inv serve   # preview the web build at http://localhost:8000
```

The landing page source is in `home_page/`. Its `_config.yml` and the CI
workflow assume the GitHub Pages site is published at
`https://bryangingechen.github.io/CombinatorialRigidity/`; if the repo is
ever renamed or moved to a different owner, update both files together.

## Automation

- **`.github/workflows/hopscotch.yml`** — daily cron that tries to
  advance the mathlib pin in `lake-manifest.json` to mathlib's current
  `master`. Opens (or refreshes) a PR if the new commit builds; opens
  a tracking issue with the bisected breaking commit if not.
- **`.github/dependabot.yml`** — monthly grouped PR bumping any
  GitHub Actions used in `.github/workflows/`.
