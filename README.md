A Lean 4 / mathlib4 formalization of combinatorial rigidity theory, working
toward **Laman's theorem** (1970): for `n ≥ 2`, a graph is generically rigid
in the plane iff it contains a `(2, 3)`-tight spanning subgraph. Phase 7
extends the development to the **Lovász–Yemini matroid identification**:
the planar rigidity matroid coincides with the `(2, 3)`-count matroid on
`E(K_V)`, packaged as a mathlib `Matroid` instance. Phase 8 reframes the
planar rigidity matroid as a linear matroid via `Matroid.ofFun` (from the
`apnelson1/Matroid` library) at a uniformly generic placement, and states
Lovász–Yemini in linear-matroid form. Phase 9 formalizes the basic
`(k, ℓ)`-pebble game of Lee–Streinu 2008 in the matroidal regime
`ℓ < 2k`, with a certificate-form correctness theorem and the matroidal-
independence corollary against the Phase 7 count matroid. Phase 10
bridges Phase 9's `noncomputable` `runPebbleGame` to an actually-runnable
decision procedure: a `Decidable G.IsLaman` instance backed by a
computable wrapper `runPebbleGameExec`, plus a `lake exe pebble-game` CLI
binary. Phase 11 reshapes Phase 9/10's `Option`-shaped
pebble-game algorithms to return a verdict-bearing inductive carrying
inline witnesses — a blocking subset `V'` on the `NOT_SPARSE` branch,
the partial orientation `D` on the accept branches — and bumps the CLI
to emit those witness lines alongside the trichotomy label, making the
CLI's classification externally checkable. **Phase 12** (in planning)
extends the development to higher-dimensional body-bar rigidity:
the goal is **Tay's theorem** (Tay 1984) — `G` admits an
infinitesimally rigid body-bar framework in `Rⁿ` iff `G` is the
edge-disjoint union of `d = n(n+1)/2` spanning trees — proved by
Whiteley's matroid-union route (Whiteley 1988), with
Tutte–Nash-Williams as a corollary; the eventual longer-horizon
target beyond Phase 12 is the **molecular conjecture**
(Katoh–Tanigawa 2011).

The development was originally hosted under `Archive/CombinatorialRigidity/`
in a fork of mathlib4 and has been lifted to this standalone, mathlib-downstream
project; commit history is preserved with paths rewritten.

## Project status

* **Phases 1–11 complete; Phase 12 blocked on an upstream prerequisite.**
* **Phases 1–11 (complete)** — sparsity, Laman, Henneberg, frameworks,
  both directions of Laman's theorem
  (`isGenericallyRigid_two_iff_exists_isLaman_le`), the Lovász–Yemini
  matroid identification (combinatorial form), the linear-matroid
  framing of the planar rigidity matroid
  (`linearRigidityMatroid_eq_rigidityMatroid`), the basic
  `(k, ℓ)`-pebble game of Lee–Streinu 2008 with matroidal-independence
  corollary (`countMatroid_indep_iff_runPebbleGame`), the executable
  pebble game (a computable wrapper `runPebbleGameExec` under
  `[LinearOrder V]`, canonical `Decidable` instances for
  `IsSparse k ℓ` / `IsTight` / `IsLaman` in the matroidal regime
  `ℓ < 2k`, and a `lake exe pebble-game` CLI binary), and the
  witness-extraction reshape that bumps `runPebbleGame` /
  `runPebbleGameExec` to a two-constructor verdict
  `PebbleGameResult G k ℓ` carrying inline witnesses on every branch
  (`.accept D _ _` with `D : PartialOrientation V`; `.reject V' _ _`
  with `V' : Finset V`). The CLI prints `LAMAN` /
  `SPARSE_NOT_TIGHT` / `NOT_SPARSE` as before, followed by witness
  lines (`ARCS u v` per arc on accept; `BLOCKING n` + `VERTEX w`
  lines per blocking-subset element on reject). Both `#eval` and
  the CLI reduce through the same compiled `runPebbleGameExec`
  body. The project carries no `sorry`s through Phase 11. See
  `notes/Phase11.md` for the layer plan; the blueprint reshape
  lands in-place in `chapter/{dfs,pebble-game,executable}.tex`.
  Phase 10 details are in `notes/Phase10.md` and
  `blueprint/src/chapter/executable.tex`.
* **Phase 12 (blocked on upstream)** — **Tay's theorem** for body-bar
  frameworks in `Rⁿ`. Layer 0 (the forward-mode dep-graph) has
  landed, but the phase is **blocked at Layer 1**: see the upstream
  note at the end of this bullet. The proof route follows Whiteley 1988's
  matroid-union framing: the generic `k`-frame matroid on a
  multigraph is identified with the `k`-fold union of the cycle
  matroid (Whiteley Theorem 1), the count characterization
  `|E'| ≤ d|V'| − d` (Whiteley Corollary 3) drops out via
  Edmonds' matroid-partition theorem, Tutte–Nash-Williams
  follows, and Tay's theorem itself (existence-of-realization
  form) is obtained by specializing two-extensor row coefficients
  to standard-basis Plücker coordinates. The whole route needs the
  matroid-union machinery (`Matroid.Union`, Edmonds matroid
  partition), which Phase 12 planned to vendor from
  `apnelson1/Matroid`'s `WIP/{Union,Submodular}.lean`. **Upstream
  blocker:** those WIP files do not build at any upstream revision —
  they transitively need `FinsetCircuitMatroid` (commented out for
  >1 year) and a `Matroid.Constructions.IsCircuitAxioms` module that
  was never committed. Phase 12 is on hold pending that machinery
  building upstream (or a decision to formalize it locally). See
  `notes/Phase12.md` for the corrected prerequisites audit, the
  blocker analysis, and resume criteria. Layer 0's chapter
  `blueprint/src/chapter/body-bar.tex` remains the forward-mode
  authoritative dep-graph and lemma index.

See `ROADMAP.md` for the canonical hand-off doc — directory layout, status,
mathematical plan, and engineering conventions. `DESIGN.md` carries
cross-cutting design rationale; `TACTICS-GOLF.md` carries idiom / golfing guidance and `TACTICS-QUIRKS.md` covers build-failure rescue.
Per-phase work logs live under `notes/`.

`CLAUDE.md` is the operating manual for AI coding agents (Claude Code et al.)
— it covers reading order, the per-session workflow, the end-of-session
friction review, and the `notes/PhaseN.md` template. Human contributors can
skim it but the primary audience is automated tooling.

## Build

```
lake exe cache get   # fetch precompiled mathlib oleans (optional but fast)
lake build
```

Lean toolchain version is pinned in `lean-toolchain` and tracks mathlib.

## Blueprint

The mathematical blueprint lives under `blueprint/`. The web and PDF
versions are built and deployed automatically by GitHub Actions on every
push to `master` (see `.github/workflows/push.yml`); to build it locally:

```sh
cd blueprint
pip install -r requirements.txt
inv web     # plastex output in blueprint/web/
inv bp      # PDF in blueprint/print/print.pdf
inv serve   # preview the web build at http://localhost:8000
```

The landing page source is in `home_page/`. Its `_config.yml` and the CI
workflow assume the GitHub Pages site is published at
`https://bryangingechen.github.io/CombinatorialRigidity/`; if the repo is
ever renamed or moved to a different owner, update both files together.

## Automation

- **`.github/workflows/hopscotch.yml`** — daily cron that tries to
  advance the mathlib pin in `lake-manifest.json` to mathlib's current
  `master`. Opens (or refreshes) a PR if the new commit builds; opens
  a tracking issue with the bisected breaking commit if not.
- **`.github/dependabot.yml`** — monthly grouped PR bumping any
  GitHub Actions used in `.github/workflows/`.
