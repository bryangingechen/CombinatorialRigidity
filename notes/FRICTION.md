# API and tactic friction log

A long-running record of one-off mathlib API gaps, tactic limitations,
and proof-shape friction encountered while building this project. Each
entry is self-contained: future agents can either add new entries,
work an open one (upstream PR / project helper / refactor), or strike
through one that has been resolved.

This file is **append-mostly**: keep resolved entries with a
strikethrough and a "Resolved by …" note rather than deleting them.
The history is the value — a future agent picking up a similar issue
can see how it was handled before.

> **Scope.** This file holds *one-off* frictions: a specific lemma I
> needed and mirrored, a specific bug I worked around. *Cross-cutting
> lessons* — "always do X", "if you see pattern Y, prefer Z" — belong
> in `TACTICS-GOLF.md` (idioms / golf) or `TACTICS-QUIRKS.md`
> (rescue / build-failure recovery) instead — together they are the
> project's tactical reference.
> Don't bury a general rule in a `[resolved]` entry here; it won't be
> found again.

## How this file is used

- After landing a phase, review what proofs felt awkward. Did you
  reach for the same glue lemma three times? Did `grind` need an
  unusually long hint list? File an entry — and if the lesson is
  cross-cutting, lift it into `TACTICS-GOLF.md` (idioms) or
  `TACTICS-QUIRKS.md` (rescue) instead.
- When starting a new session, optionally browse [Open](#open) for a
  small upstream-able item to land alongside the main work. Skim
  [Anti-patterns / known dead ends](#anti-patterns--known-dead-ends)
  if you're about to try something that might already have been
  rejected.
- Items that turned into actual upstream candidates live under
  `Mathlib/<exact mathlib path>` (project mirror); each entry under
  [Mirrored](#mirrored) links to its mirror file.
- The "Ending a session" step in `ROADMAP.md` includes a friction
  review: do not skip it. Even "no new entries this session" is a
  useful checkpoint.

## Entry format

```
### [STATUS] Short title
- **Where it bit:** which proof / file
- **Friction:** what extra work was needed
- **Proposed fix:** named lemma / tactic / refactor
- **Status:** open / mirrored / upstreamed / wontfix / resolved
- **Mirror file (if any):** path under `Mathlib/`
```

## Sections

- [Open](#open) — actionable items you'd consider working on.
- [Anti-patterns / known dead ends](#anti-patterns--known-dead-ends)
  — wontfix items: tried-and-rejected approaches, deprecated patterns,
  tactic limitations. Worth seeing once so future agents don't
  re-litigate.
- [Mirrored](#mirrored) — upstream-eligible lemmas now living under
  `Mathlib/<path>`. Active reference list — DESIGN.md "Mirror
  directory" points here.
- [FRICTION-archive.md](FRICTION-archive.md) — design history for
  resolved project-internal entries (helper extraction, refactor,
  simp-set tweak). Search-target only, not read-on-load. Moved out
  of this file post-Phase-6 audit once each entry's resolution had a
  real index elsewhere (mirror lemma, project helper, or
  TACTICS-GOLF / TACTICS-QUIRKS § cross-reference).

**Filing rule for new entries.** Pick by what the *next agent* would
do with it: open if you'd act on it; anti-pattern if you wouldn't but
want to warn future agents; mirrored if you mirrored an upstream
lemma; resolved otherwise. File new resolved entries here first
(they may want eyes); migrate to `FRICTION-archive.md` on the next
housekeeping pass once their resolution is fully indexed.

## Open

### [resolved] `[matroid]` The vendored `apnelson1/Matroid` package already supplies a full multigraph `Graph.degree` + handshake API — do not roll your own
- **Where it bit:** `Graph.exists_degree_le_two` in `Molecular/Induction.lean` (Phase 20
  KT 4.6, F″ core). The Phase-20 hand-off note asserted "the project has no `Graph α β`
  degree function" and scoped F″ as building one (degree, the `∑ deg = 2|E|` handshake,
  pigeonhole) from scratch. A first draft did exactly that (`endpointMult`/`degree`/
  `sum_endpointMult_eq_two`/handshake) — then the build reported `Graph.degree` *already
  declared*, resolving to a vendored definition `G.degree v = (G.eDegree v).toNat`.
- **Resolution:** `.lake/packages/Matroid/Matroid/Graph/Degree/Basic.lean` carries the entire
  development: `incFun` (the `α →₀ ℕ` endpoint-multiplicity finsupp, loops count 2),
  `eDegree`/`degree`, `sum_incFun_eq_two`, and the handshake `handshake_eDegree`,
  `handshake_degree_subtype` (`∑ᶠ v ∈ V(G), G.degree v = 2 * E(G).ncard`, needs `[G.Finite]`),
  `handshake_degree_finset`, `handshake`. It is transitively imported via the `cycleMatroid`
  chain, so it is usable in `Induction.lean` with **zero** new imports. `[G.Finite]` is
  discharged under the project's `[Finite α] [Finite β]` by
  `{ edgeSet_finite := Set.toFinite _, vertexSet_finite := Set.toFinite _ }` (anonymous
  constructor `⟨⟨_⟩, _⟩` mis-elaborates — use named fields).
- **General lesson:** **`grep .lake/packages/Matroid` for any `Graph α β` graph-theory notion
  before building it** — the vendored package is a large, actively-developed graph library
  (degree, connectivity, matching, walks/trails), not just the matroid-union subsystem that
  was originally ported. A stale "the project has no X" hand-off note is not evidence X is
  absent from the dependency closure.
- **Status:** resolved (reused the vendored API; F″ core landed as the pigeonhole on top).

### [resolved] `Set.ncard_pos` (and `ncard_diff_singleton_of_mem`) carry a `(hs : s.Finite := by toFinite_tac)` autoparam, not an explicit arg — pass `(Set.toFinite _)` or omit
- **Where it bit:** `Graph.isBase_vfiber_ncard_ge` in `Molecular/Induction.lean` (Phase 20
  forest-surgery TODO, `lem:base-vfiber-count`). Two stumbles in one proof: `Set.ncard_pos.mpr hne`
  failed (`Unknown constant Set.ncard_pos.mpr`) because the finiteness autoparam blocks the
  dot-`.mpr` chain, and `Set.ncard_diff_singleton_of_mem hvG (Set.toFinite _)` failed (`Function
  expected at (Set.toFinite _)`) because that lemma takes **only** `(h : a ∈ s)` — no finiteness
  argument at all.
- **Resolution:** for `ncard_pos`, supply the autoparam explicitly then chain:
  `Set.ncard_pos (Set.toFinite _) |>.mpr hne`. For `ncard_diff_singleton_of_mem`, pass only the
  membership; its RHS is `s.ncard - 1` (ℕ-subtraction), so wrap in an `omega` after an ℤ-cast goal.
- **General lesson:** when a `Set.ncard` lemma fails to apply, check its signature for a
  `(by toFinite_tac)` autoparam — it sits *between* the explicit args and breaks both naive
  positional application and `.mpr`/`.mp` dot-chaining. Pass `(Set.toFinite _)` for the autoparam
  slot, or use the bare lemma if it has none.
- **Status:** resolved (idiom in-proof; no mirror — it's a calling-convention gotcha, not a missing lemma).

### [resolved] A lemma whose *statement* mentions `cutLabeling V' a b` needs `[∀ x, Decidable (x ∈ V')]` in the binder list
- **Where it bit:** `crossingEdges_cutLabeling_singleton_subset` / `_ncard_le` in
  `Molecular/Induction.lean` (Phase 20 KT 4.6, `lem:reducible-vertex` cut↔degree bridge).
  `cutLabeling V' a b` carries an instance argument `[∀ x, Decidable (x ∈ V')]`; with the
  ambient context holding only `[Finite α]` (no `DecidableEq α`), a `classical` inside the
  proof does **not** supply the instance the *statement* needs — the statement elaborates
  before the tactic block. Build error: *"failed to synthesize `(x : α) → Decidable (x ∈ {v})`"*.
- **Resolution:** add `[∀ x, Decidable (x ∈ ({v} : Set α))]` to the lemma binders. At the
  caller (`exists_degree_eq_two`, which has only `[Finite α]`), `classical` then discharges
  this singleton-membership instance for the term-mode applications.
- **General lesson:** when a lemma's *statement* references a definition carrying a
  `[Decidable …]` / `[DecidableEq …]` instance arg, that instance must be in the binder list
  (or derivable from one), not introduced by an in-proof `classical`. Same shape as the
  `Matroid.Union [DecidableEq β]`-in-the-statement entry below.
- **Status:** resolved.

### [resolved] `[matroid]` Fundamental-circuit-swap idioms: finite-min over bases, "indep of full rank ⟹ base", and the `X∩ẽ≠∅` base-meets-fiber move
- **Where it bit:** `Graph.no_rigid_edge_count` in `Molecular/Induction.lean` (Phase 20
  KT 4.5(i), F′ swap core). KT's proof argues "`X∩ẽ=∅` ⟹ `D` spanning trees avoid `ẽ`,
  contra minimality" (forest language); the prior session read this as a real blocker.
- **Friction / resolution:** three reusable moves, all standard once stated cleanly:
  1. **Min over bases:** `Set.exists_min_image {B | M.IsBase B} (fun B ↦ (ẽ ∩ B).ncard)`;
     finiteness of `{B | IsBase B}` via `(Set.toFinite M.E).finite_subsets` + `subset_ground`,
     nonemptiness via `M.exists_isBase`.
  2. **Indep of full rank ⟹ base, without a dedicated lemma:** `exists_isBase_superset` to a
     base `B'`, then `Set.eq_of_subset_of_ncard_le` with `|I| = |B*| = |B'|` (all bases share
     cardinality, `IsBase.ncard_eq_ncard_of_isBase`) forces `I = B'`.
  3. **`X∩ẽ≠∅` is base-meets-fiber, not forest:** if `X∩ẽ=∅`, `X−ej` is independent of full
     size (tight on `V(X)=V`) ⟹ a base avoiding `ẽ`, contradicting `IsMinimalKDof`'s clause
     (`hG.2`). No `rank M↾(E∖ẽ)` detour.
- **General lesson:** "KT argues by forests" does not mean the Lean must — when the consumed
  fact is a base/fiber statement, route directly through the minimality clause. The base
  exchange itself is `IsBase.exchange_isBase_of_indep` + `Indep.mem_fundCircuit_iff`
  (`ej ∈ fundCircuit f B ↔ Indep(insert f B ∖ {ej})`). These three carry the remaining
  circuit-swap commits (G/H) too.
- **Status:** resolved.

### [resolved] `[matroid]` Transporting circuits between `M(G̃)` and `M(H̃)` for `H ≤ G`; and a rank count that bypasses KT 4.8(i)'s iterated swap
- **Where it bit:** `Graph.circuit_splitOff_meets_fiber` + `Graph.splitOff_isMinimalKDof` in
  `Molecular/Induction.lean` (Phase 20, KT 4.8(i) splitting-off minimality transport).
- **Friction / resolution — circuit transport:** to move a circuit between `M(G̃)` and `M(H̃)`
  for a graph-level `H ≤ G`, compose mathlib `Matroid.restrict_isCircuit_iff`
  (`(M ↾ R).IsCircuit C ↔ M.IsCircuit C ∧ C ⊆ R`) with the project's
  `matroidMG_restrict_mulTilde` (`M(G̃) ↾ E(H̃) = M(H̃)`). `restrict_isCircuit_iff`'s ground
  side-goal `R ⊆ M.E` is `(edgeMultiply_mono h _).edgeSet_mono`. Same composition for `Indep`
  (`Matroid.restrict_indep_iff`) and for "whole ground independent ⟹ base"
  (`Matroid.ground_indep_iff_isBase`, after `rw [matroidMG, restrict_ground_eq]` to expose the
  ground as `E(H̃)`). KT's (4.10) "every circuit of `M(G̃_v^{ab})` meets `ã̃b`" is most cleanly
  stated/used as "`E(G̃_v)` is independent (circuit-free) in `M(G̃_v^{ab})`" via
  `Matroid.indep_iff_forall_subset_not_isCircuit'`.
- **General lesson — bypass the iterated swap with a rank count.** KT 4.8(i) proves minimality
  by an iterated fundamental-circuit swap (relocate each `ã̃b` copy onto an `ẽ` copy, induction
  on `|B₁ ∩ ã̃b|`). The whole induction is unnecessary: once `E(G̃_v)` is a *base* of `M(G̃_v)`
  (from (4.10)) and `def(G̃_v) > 0` (KT 4.7), any base `B'` of `M(G̃_v^{ab})` avoiding a fiber
  `ẽ` splits as `(B'∩ã̃b) ⊔ (B'∩E(G̃_v))` with `|B'∩ã̃b| ≤ D−1` and `|B'∩E(G̃_v)| ≤ |E(G̃_v)|−(D−1)`
  (when `e≠e₀`) or `B' ⊆ E(G̃_v)` (when `e=e₀`), so `|B'| ≤ |E(G̃_v)|`; through
  `isBase_ncard_add_deficiency_eq` on the two bases this forces `def(G̃_v) ≤ 0` — contradiction.
  Pattern: *an iterated basis-exchange whose only purpose is to relocate redundancy onto a fixed
  set is often replaceable by a single cardinality split across that set's complement.*
- **Status:** resolved.

### [resolved] `[matroid]` Extending a cycle-matroid-independent set by a *pendant* edge: the `Isolated`/bridge idiom
- **Where it bit:** `Graph.acyclicSet_insert_vfiber_of_not_inc` in `Molecular/Induction.lean`
  (Phase 20, KT 4.1 balanced-packing redistribution kernel).
- **Friction / resolution:** to show `cycleMatroid.Indep (insert x F)` for a forest `F` whose
  edges avoid a vertex `v` and a non-loop `v`-fiber `x : v—w` (`w ≠ v`), the clean route is
  entirely vendored `apnelson1/Matroid` graph API: `Graph.cycleMatroid_indep`
  (`Indep = IsAcyclicSet`) → `Graph.isAcyclicSet_iff` (`= F ⊆ E ∧ (G ↾ F).IsForest`) →
  `Graph.IsForest.of_deleteEdges_singleton (he : bridge x) (hG : (R ＼ {x}).IsForest)`. The
  deleted-graph forest goal closes by `IsForest.anti` after `Graph.restrict_deleteEdges`
  (`(G ↾ F₁) ＼ F₂ = G ↾ (F₁ \ F₂)`) + `Graph.restrict_le_restrict` (needs
  `E ∩ F₁ ⊆ E ∩ F₂`). The bridge closes by `IsLink.isBridge_iff_not_connBetween` then
  `Isolated.connBetween_iff_eq` — the latter is the key lever: a vertex incident to *no* edge
  of the deleted graph is `Graph.Isolated`, so any `ConnBetween v w` forces `v = w`.
- **General lesson:** *for "adding a degree-≤-1 edge keeps a graph acyclic", don't reason
  about cyclic walks directly — go through `Isolated` (the endpoint has no other edge) +
  `Isolated.connBetween_iff_eq` to get a bridge, then `IsForest.of_deleteEdges_singleton`.*
  Gotcha: `Graph.restrict_isLink`/`restrict_inc` put the **set-membership conjunct first**
  (`e ∈ F ∧ G.IsLink e x y`), not the link first.
- **Status:** resolved.

### [resolved] `[matroid]` Building a small explicit cyclic walk (`IsCyclicWalk`) needs the full structure tower + a hoisted `IsWalk` `have`
- **Where it bit:** `Graph.isCycleSet_pair_edgeFiber_splitOff` in `Molecular/Induction.lean`
  (Phase 20 `lem:forest-surgery-split` reroute-count substrate). To exhibit `{p, q}` as a
  cycle of `G̃ᵥᵃᵇ` I constructed the explicit length-2 walk `cons a p (cons b q (nil a))` and
  had to discharge `IsCyclicWalk` directly.
- **Friction:** (1) `IsCyclicWalk` extends `IsTour` extends `IsTrail` extends `IsWalk`, so the
  anonymous constructor is the 4-deep nest `⟨⟨⟨hwalk, edge_nodup⟩, nonempty, isClosed⟩, nodup⟩`
  — easy to mis-count fields (initial `⟨⟨⟨?_,?_,?_⟩,?_⟩,?_⟩` gave "Constructor IsTour.mk has 3
  explicit fields, but only 2 provided"). (2) The `IsWalk` proof must be hoisted into a separate
  `have hwalk`; inlining it as `⟨…, hlinkq.symm.walk_isWalk⟩` type-mismatches because the
  innermost tail is `IsWalk (nil a)`, **not** `q`'s link-walk — close it with `nil_isWalk_iff`
  + `hlinkp.left_mem` (membership of the endpoint). (3) `cons_isWalk_iff` / `nil_isWalk_iff` are
  `Graph.`-namespaced, not `WList.` (first guess `WList.cons_isWalk_iff` was "unknown constant").
- **Fix / general lesson:** for a hand-built short cyclic walk, hoist the `IsWalk` to its own
  `have` (peel with `cons_isWalk_iff` ×k + `nil_isWalk_iff`), then `refine` the `IsCyclicWalk`
  tower as `⟨⟨⟨hwalk, ?_⟩, by simp, ?_⟩, ?_⟩` and close `edge_nodup` / `isClosed` / `nodup` by
  `simp` (feed the edge-distinctness `p ≠ q` and the vertex-distinctness `a ≠ b`). The edge-set
  equation `E(C) = {p, q}` is plain `simp`. Project-internal (about our `splitOff`/`mulTilde`),
  so it lives in `Induction.lean`; no upstream mirror.
- **Status:** resolved.

### [resolved] `[matroid]` no mathlib "base of `M ／ C` lifts to base of `M` via a basis of `C`" — route through `IsBasis'.contract_eq_contract_delete` + loops
- **Where it bit:** `Matroid.IsBase.union_isBasis_of_contract` in
  `Molecular/Induction.lean` (Phase 20 `lem:contract-minimality-transport`). mathlib
  has `Indep.contract_isBase_iff` (`(M／I).IsBase B ↔ M.IsBase (B∪I) ∧ Disjoint B I`)
  only for **independent** contracted `I`; for a general `C` there is no
  `(M／C).IsBase B' → M.IsBasis' J C → M.IsBase (B'∪J)`. Build it: pick `J` a basis of
  `C` (`exists_isBasis'`), rewrite `M ／ C = M ／ J ＼ (C\J)`
  (`IsBasis'.contract_eq_contract_delete`) + `delete_isBase_iff`; the deleted `C\J` is
  loops of `M ／ J` (`contract_loops_eq` gives `loops = M.closure J \ J ⊇ C\J` since
  `C ⊆ closure J`), so `ground \ (C\J)` is spanning (`closure_diff_loops_eq` +
  `closure_ground`) and `B'` is a base of `M ／ J` (`IsBasis.isBase_of_spanning`); then
  `Indep.contract_isBase_iff` finishes.
- **Fix / general lesson:** `IsBasis'` does **not** give `C ⊆ M.E` (it intersects
  ground internally), so the loops-containment must intersect with ground: prove
  `C ∩ M.E ⊆ M.closure J` (via `IsBasis'.closure_eq_closure` + `subset_closure_of_subset'`
  on `C ∩ M.E`), not `C ⊆ M.closure J`. General: when lifting a contraction base, reduce
  to contracting an *independent* basis of the contracted set and discharge the leftover
  via the loops/spanning route; and remember `IsBasis'` carries no ground containment for
  its `X`.

### [resolved] `[matroid]` contraction rank arithmetic already lives in vendored `Matroid.Minor.Rank`; the `cast_int` form's RHS is ℤ-subtraction, annotate as such
- **Where it bit:** `Matroid.rank_contract_add_rank_restrict` in
  `Molecular/Induction.lean` (Phase 20 `lem:contraction-minimality` contraction
  arithmetic). The standard matroid identity `r(M/C) = r(M) − r_M(C)` is **not**
  in mathlib's `Matroid` minor files, but the vendored `apnelson1/Matroid`
  package's `Matroid/Minor/Rank.lean` already carries it: `contract_rk_add_eq`
  (`(M／C).rk X + M.rk C = M.rk (X∪C)`) and the `@[simp]`
  `contract_rank_cast_int_eq` (`((M／C).rank : ℤ) = M.rank − M.rk C`). No need to
  re-derive via the `eRelRk_add_eRk_eq` chain rule — search the vendored
  `Minor/Rank.lean` first. Also `restrict_rk_eq M subset_rfl` gives
  `(M↾C).rank = M.rk C` (via `(M↾C).E = C`).
- **Fix / general lesson:** `contract_rank_cast_int_eq`'s RHS is `↑M.rank − ↑(M.rk C)`
  (ℤ-`Sub`), **not** `↑(M.rank − M.rk C)` (cast of ℕ-truncated-sub) — annotating the
  `have` as the latter is a type mismatch. Write the `have` type with explicit ℤ
  casts on each atom (`(M.rank : ℤ) − (M.rk C : ℤ)`) and close the ℕ goal with
  `omega` (it bridges the ℕ `restrict` fact and the ℤ `contract` fact). General:
  for the vendored package's `*_cast_int_eq` rank lemmas, the int form uses honest
  ℤ-subtraction; keep atoms ℤ-cast and let `omega` reconcile.

### [resolved] A hand-rolled `Graph α β` with several fresh edge labels needs a distinctness guard baked into a clause, or `eq_or_eq_of_isLink_of_isLink` is unprovable
- **Where it bit:** `Graph.edgeSplit` in `Molecular/Induction.lean` (Phase 20
  `def:graph-operations`). Edge-splitting subdivides `e₀` into a path `a–v–b`
  carried by two *fresh* edge labels `e₁`, `e₂`. The structure-literal `IsLink`
  has one clause per label; if `e₁ = e₂` the two new-edge clauses both fire on the
  same label with links `a–v` and `v–b`, and `eq_or_eq_of_isLink_of_isLink` then
  demands `a = v ∨ a = b`, which can fail — the def is *not well-formed* without
  distinct labels. No external hypothesis was wanted (it would break the
  `IsLink`/`vertexSet` `Iff.rfl`/`rfl` simp lemmas).
- **Fix / general lesson:** bake a single `e ≠ e₁` guard into the `e₂` clause
  (`e = e₂ ∧ e ≠ e₁ ∧ …`); if the labels coincide the `e₂` clause is vacuous and
  the result is a degenerate-but-well-formed graph (downstream always passes
  distinct labels). When hand-rolling a `Graph` via structure literal that adds
  *N ≥ 2* new edge labels, make the clauses label-exclusive by guard so
  `eq_or_eq` is dischargeable — then the 3×3 (or N×N) cross-cases close by
  `grind` (contradictory `e = eᵢ` / `e ≠ eⱼ` hyps) interleaved with the
  endpoint-disjunction `rcases … <;> simp` for the genuine same-label cases.
  Note the `rintro ⟨rfl, …⟩` on `e = eᵢ` substitutes the *parameter* `eᵢ`, not
  the bound `e` (TACTICS-QUIRKS § 4 subst-direction trap), so bind the equality
  as a named hyp rather than `rfl`-matching it inside the case split.

### [resolved] A choice-of-representative label `if h : s.Nonempty then h.choose else _` trips `rw`-motive when you rewrite the set `s` underneath — factor through the *object* so equality is `congrArg`
- **Where it bit:** `componentLabel` in `Molecular/Deficiency.lean` (Phase 19
  `thm:def-eq-corank` piece 3). The component label of a vertex is a chosen
  vertex of its `walkable`-component; proving it constant on a component means
  showing `ConnBetween x y → label x = label y`, where `ConnBetween` gives
  `walkable x = walkable y`. A direct `componentLabel H x := if h :
  V(H.walkable x).Nonempty then h.choose else x` form forces, after `dif_pos`,
  the goal `hx.choose = hy.choose` with `hx : V(walkable x).Nonempty`; rewriting
  the walkable-set equality there is a *"motive is not type correct"* (`rw`
  wants to rewrite inside the type of the `Exists.choose` proof argument).
- **Fix / general lesson:** factor the choice through a function on the *object*
  whose equality you have — `pickVertex (K : Graph) := if h : V(K).Nonempty then
  h.choose else arbitrary`, `componentLabel H x := pickVertex (H.walkable x)`.
  Then constancy is `congrArg pickVertex (h.walkable_eq_walkable)` — no `dite`,
  no motive. Whenever a `Classical.choice`/`Exists.choose`-based selector must be
  proved constant on a fiber, define it as `select ∘ (canonical object map)` and
  reduce to `congrArg select` on an equality of canonical objects, rather than
  carrying the membership proof into the `dite` and rewriting under it.

### [resolved] Weak-duality `rank + def ≤ D(|V|-1)` is FALSE at `D = 0` — needs an explicit `1 ≤ bodyBarDim n` hypothesis
- **Where it bit:** `rank_add_partitionDef_le` / `rank_add_deficiency_le`
  in `Molecular/Deficiency.lean` (Phase 19 `lem:weak-duality`). The first
  draft omitted any `D`-positivity hypothesis; the `D = 0` case `nlinarith`
  refused. Root cause is mathematical, not tactical: at `D = bodyBarDim n =
  0`, `bodyHingeMult n = D - 1 = 0` (ℕ-sub) so `G̃` is edgeless and
  `rank M(G̃) = 0`, but `partitionDef = D(|P|-1) - (D-1)·d = -(-1)·d = d`,
  so `rank + def_P = d` while the RHS `D(|V|-1) = 0` — false whenever a
  partition crosses an edge. Fixed by adding `hD : 1 ≤ bodyBarDim n` (same
  hypothesis `lem:two-edge-conn`/`two_le_crossingEdges_of_isKDof_zero`
  already carries); the conjecture runs at `n ≥ 2`, `D ≥ 3`, so it costs
  nothing downstream.
- **General lesson:** the signed `ℤ`-valued `partitionDef` with `(D-1)`
  ℕ-subtraction is well-behaved only for `D ≥ 1`; any deficiency-side
  bound that puts `D(|V|-1)` on the RHS should take `1 ≤ bodyBarDim n` up
  front rather than discover the degenerate `D = 0` branch mid-`nlinarith`.

### [resolved] `ciSup_le` on `deficiency = ⨆ f : α → α, partitionDef …` needs `rw [deficiency]` + `Nonempty α`
- **Where it bit:** `splitOff_deficiency_le` in `Molecular/Induction.lean`
  (Phase 20 `lem:splitoff-deficiency`, the deficiency-route `≤` direction).
  Bounding `def(H̃) = ⨆ f', H.partitionDef n f'` by `def(G̃)` per-partition
  wants `ciSup_le`, but two things block it: (i) `deficiency` is a plain
  `noncomputable def`, so the `⨆` is hidden — `rw [deficiency]` first; (ii)
  `ciSup_le` needs `[Nonempty (α → α)]`, which `Pi.instNonempty` derives only
  from `Nonempty α` — *not* automatic. Supply `haveI : Nonempty α := ⟨a⟩`
  from any vertex in hand (here `a := hla.right_mem`-style).
- **General lesson:** the prior deficiency lemmas all bounded *from below*
  via `partitionDef_le_deficiency` (`le_ciSup`, no `Nonempty` need); this is
  the first to bound `deficiency` *from above*, so it is the first to want
  `ciSup_le`. The removal bound (commit D) takes the same shape — open with
  `rw [deficiency]; haveI : Nonempty α := ⟨_⟩; refine ciSup_le fun f' => ?_`.
- **Dual shape (commit C, `splitOff_deficiency_ge`, lower bound on the
  *split-off* deficiency):** to lower-bound `def(H̃)` by `def(G̃) − 1` you
  need a *maximizer* of `def(G̃)`, not `ciSup_le`. Get one with
  `obtain ⟨f, hf⟩ := exists_eq_ciSup_of_finite (f := G.partitionDef n)`
  (`Nonempty α` ⟹ `Nonempty (α → α)`, `Finite α` ⟹ `Finite (α → α)`), then
  `rw [deficiency, ← hf]` to expose `def(G̃) = partitionDef f` and bound the
  *target* `def(H̃)` from below by `H.partitionDef_le_deficiency n f`
  (`le_trans`). The deficiency-as-attained-max idiom recurs in the dof
  bookkeeping; reach for `exists_eq_ciSup_of_finite` whenever a partition
  witness for `def(G̃)` itself is needed.

### [resolved] Pinning `rank M(G̃) = D(|V|−1)` from a two-sided bound: `zify [hPos]` the ℕ rank bound, then a `D·(F−1) = D·F − D` ring-bridge for `linarith`
- **Where it bit:** `circuit_induces_isRigidSubgraph` in `Molecular/Induction.lean`
  (Phase 20 `lem:circuit-induces-rigid`, rigid-subgraph form). To turn the
  tightness equality `|X−e| = D(|V(X)|−1)` into `def(G[V(X)]̃) = 0` you pin
  `rank M(H̃)` from both sides: the upper bound `rank_matroidMG_le` is **ℕ-valued**
  with a ℕ-subtraction `D·(F − 1)`; the lower bound and `rank_add_deficiency_eq` are
  **ℤ-native** with `D·(↑F − 1)`. Two snags: (i) `rank_matroidMG_le`'s `↑(F − 1)`
  is a *cast of a ℕ-subtraction* — `omega`/`linarith` can't relate it to `↑F − 1`
  until you `zify [hFpos] at hupper` (the `1 ≤ F` side-goal discharges the
  truncation); (ii) the three D-products `D·(↑F − 1)` (bridge, upper) and `D·↑F`
  (tightness) are **opaque distinct atoms** to `omega`/`linarith` — supply the link
  `have hmul : (D:ℤ)·((F:ℤ) − 1) = (D:ℤ)·F − D := by ring` so `linarith` can chain
  them. (Writing the bridge LHS as `((F:ℤ) − 1)`, *not* `(F − 1 : ℕ)` cast — the
  latter re-introduces the ℕ-subtraction.)
- **General lesson:** ℕ→ℤ bound-mixing where a product `c·(n−1)` straddles the two
  rings is a recurrent deficiency-side shape. `zify [pos-hyp]` the ℕ side first,
  then hand `linarith` an explicit `c·(n−1) = c·n − c` ring fact, since neither
  `omega` (no var·var) nor `linarith` (atoms) expands the product on its own.

### [resolved] `Graph.edgeMultiply m`'s `IsLink`/`Inc` are defeq to the base graph's but not syntactically — `IsLink.mono` needs a type ascription
- **Where it bit:** `edgeMultiply_mono` in `BodyBar/BodyHinge.lean`
  (Phase 19 `lem:matroid-restrict-subgraph` engine). `(G.edgeMultiply
  m).IsLink p x y` reduces to `G.IsLink p.1 x y`, but discharging the
  `IsSubgraph.isLink_mono` field with `hp.mono h` fails *"application
  type mismatch"* because Lean does not unfold the `edgeMultiply.IsLink`
  redex to find the `IsLink.mono` motive. Fixed by ascribing the result
  type: `(IsLink.mono h hp : G.IsLink p.1 x y)`. Same flavour for
  `Inc`: the `spanningVerts`-agreement in `matroidMG_restrict_mulTilde`
  routes incidences through `hHG.inc_congr` rather than relying on the
  `Inc` redex unfolding.
- **General lesson:** when a `def`'d graph (here `edgeMultiply`) defines
  `IsLink`/`Inc` *through* the base graph's, the resulting term is defeq
  but the `IsLink`/`Inc` API lemmas don't fire syntactically — ascribe
  the base-graph type, or restate via the congruence lemmas
  (`IsSubgraph.isLink_iff` / `.inc_congr`). One build cycle.

### ~~[open] No mathlib `Finset.univ.orderEmbOfFin = id` for `Fin n`~~
- **Resolved by mirroring** (Phase 17-cleanup D2): the two callsites
  (`pluckerCoord_univ`, `extensor_ne_zero_iff_linearIndependent`, both in
  `Molecular/Extensor.lean`) hit the threshold the original entry named
  ("if a third hits, mirror" — two same-shape callsites is the trigger).
  Mirrored as `Finset.univ_orderEmbOfFin` (a `@[simp]` lemma); see
  [Mirrored](#mirrored). Both callsites collapse from the two-step
  `orderEmbOfFin_unique … strictMono_id` `have` to a one-line `rw`/`simp`.

### [open] No mathlib `exteriorPower.ιMulti v ≠ 0 ↔ LinearIndependent v` (over a field)
- **Where it bit:** `extensor_ne_zero_iff_linearIndependent` in
  `Molecular/Extensor.lean` (Phase 17 `def:affine-subspace-extensor`).
  The `C(·)`-nonvanishing characterization needs `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti
  ℝ k v ≠ 0 ↔ LinearIndependent ℝ v`. mathlib has the two halves but no
  packaged iff: the `⇐`-`zero` (forward, dependent ⇒ 0) direction is
  `AlternatingMap.map_linearDependent` (needs `[IsDomain]` +
  `[IsTorsionFree]`, both free for `ℝ`); the `⇒`-`ne_zero` (independent
  ⇒ nonzero) direction has to be assembled from
  `exteriorPower.ιMulti_family_linearIndependent_field` +
  `LinearIndependent.ne_zero` at the unique `powersetCard (Fin k) k`
  index, then `Subtype.ext` into the `⋀[ℝ]^k` coercion and a `change`
  to unfold the `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti_family` abbrev back to the bare
  `ιMulti` (the index reindexing is `id`, via the orderEmbOfFin entry
  above). ~12 lines for what reads as one line of math.
- **Proposed fix:** upstream `exteriorPower.ιMulti_ne_zero_iff_linearIndependent`
  (field version) into `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/ExteriorPower/Basis.lean`,
  next to `ιMulti_family_linearIndependent_field`. Not mirrored yet —
  single callsite so far; mirror under `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/
  ExteriorPower/Basis.lean` if Lemma 2.1 or a Phase-18 consumer needs
  the bare-extensor nonvanishing fact again.
- **Status:** open. **Kept deferred (Phase 17-cleanup D2 decision):**
  unlike its two sibling Phase-17 entries (orderEmbOfFin-is-id,
  `Finset.pair_eq_pair_iff`), this one does *not* reduce to a clean glue
  lemma — the ~12-line proof leans on deep `ExteriorPower` internals
  (`ιMulti_family_linearIndependent_field`, the `⋀[ℝ]^k`-coercion
  `Subtype.ext`, the folded `ιMulti_family` abbrev that forces the `change`
  to bare `ιMulti`). It belongs upstream *next to*
  `ιMulti_family_linearIndependent_field`, not in a thin project mirror;
  single callsite, no third consumer yet. The orderEmbOfFin-is-id mirror
  (now landed) only shaved the `hid` derivation inside this proof — the
  residual `change` is this entry's gap, not the orderEmbOfFin one.

### ~~[resolved] `simp [← smul_sub]` / `simp [add_sub_add_comm]` stalls on the graded-piece screw subtype (RingQuot ops not exposed)~~
- **Migrated to `FRICTION-archive.md`** (post-Phase-18 cleanup round D3):
  the general lesson ("over a `RingQuot`-built algebra subtype, prefer
  explicit `rw` of the `AddCommGroup`/`Module` identity over
  `simp [← lemma]`") was lifted to TACTICS-QUIRKS § 26; the worked
  `infinitesimalMotions.smul_mem'` case study lives in the archive.

### ~~[open] No `Finset.pair_eq_pair_iff` (only the `Set` version)~~
- **Resolved by mirroring** (Phase 17-cleanup D2): mirrored as
  `Finset.pair_eq_pair_iff` next to the `Set` version; see
  [Mirrored](#mirrored). Single callsite (the off-diagonal `hne` step of
  `omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent`, `Molecular/Extensor.lean`), but the
  fact is a general `Finset`/`Set` glue lemma cleanly parallel to the
  existing `Set.pair_eq_pair_iff`, and mirroring collapses the three glue
  rewrites (`← coe_inj`, two `coe_pair`, `Set.pair_eq_pair_iff`) to a
  single `rw [Finset.pair_eq_pair_iff]`.

### [resolved] `[matroid]` `Matroid.Union` needs `[DecidableEq β]` in the *statement* signature, not just the proof
- **Where it bit:** `Graph.isSparse_restrict_of_union_pow_indep` in
  `BodyBar/TreePacking.lean` (Phase 13 forward direction). The lemma
  *states* `(Matroid.Union (fun _ : Fin k ↦ G.cycleMatroid)).Indep E'`
  as a hypothesis; `Matroid.Union (Ms : ι → Matroid α)` carries
  `[DecidableEq α]` (here `α := β`, the edge type), so the type itself
  fails to elaborate without the instance. A `classical` in the *proof
  body* does not help — the instance is needed at signature-elaboration
  time, before the tactic block runs. **Fix:** add `[DecidableEq β]` as
  an explicit instance binder to any lemma that *mentions*
  `Matroid.Union`-of-`cycleMatroid` in its statement (we already have
  `[Finite β]`, which does not imply `DecidableEq`).
- **Status:** resolved — the binder is on both
  `isSparse_restrict_of_union_pow_indep` and the assembled iff
  `unionPow_cycleMatroid_indep_iff_isSparse_restrict`
  (`BodyBar/TreePacking.lean`); `tutte_nash_williams` /
  `isSpanningTreePacking_of_isTight` inherit it. Phases 14–15 mentioning
  the same union object in a signature will need it too. (Confirmed:
  Phase 14's `kFrameMatroid_eq_unionPow_cycleMatroid` needed it.)

### [resolved] `[matroid]` `Matroid.Union`'s ground set is `univ`, not the common ground of its factors
- **Where it bit:** `Graph.kFrameMatroid_eq_unionPow_cycleMatroid`
  (`BodyBar/KFrame.lean`, Phase-14 closer). The documented target was the
  bare equality `G.kFrameMatroid k = Matroid.Union (fun _ ↦ G.cycleMatroid)`,
  but it is **unprovable**: `Matroid.Union Ms = (Matroid.sum' Ms).adjMap _ univ`
  (`Matroid/Constructions/Union.lean`), and `adjMap _ _ univ` has ground set
  `univ : Set β` (`Matroid.adjMap_ground_eq`, vendored). So the union's ground
  is `univ`, while `kFrameMatroid` (= `Matroid.ofFun … E(G) …`) has ground
  `E(G)`. The two agree on *independent* sets (all `⊆ E(G)`) but the union
  carries every non-edge of `β` as a loop. **Fix:** restrict the union to
  `E(G)`: `… = (Matroid.Union …) ↾ E(G)`. The `Matroid.ext_indep` then closes
  via `Matroid.restrict_ground_eq` (ground half) and `Matroid.restrict_indep_iff`
  + `and_iff_left hI` (indep half, on `I ⊆ E(G)` supplied by `ext_indep`).
- **General lesson:** when stating an equality whose RHS is a vendored
  `Matroid.Union` (or any `adjMap … univ`-built matroid), check the ground set
  before assuming it matches the factors' — it is `univ`. A blueprint/notes
  claim of "both sides have ground `E(G)`" for such an equality is a smell.
- **Status:** resolved — the `↾ E(G)` form landed; blueprint
  `thm:k-frame-union-cycle` statement + proof restated with a one-clause aside.

### [resolved] `[matroid]` `IsCircuit.subset_ground` for `M(G̃)` gives `X ⊆ (G.matroidMG n).E`, defeq-but-not-syntactic to `E(G.mulTilde n)` — `inter_eq_right.mpr` needs a `show`-ascription
- **Where it bit:** `Graph.circuit_ncard_gt` / `circuit_induces_isTight`
  (`Molecular/Induction.lean`, Phase 20). `(G.matroidMG n).E` is the
  union-then-restrict ground `↾ E(G.mulTilde n)` (sibling of the `Union` ground
  being `univ`, above), so `hX.subset_ground : X ⊆ (G.matroidMG n).E` does not
  syntactically unify with the `E(G.mulTilde n)` that `edgeSet_restrict` /
  `inter_eq_right` want. `rw [edgeSet_restrict, inter_eq_right.mpr hX.subset_ground]`
  fails ("did not find pattern"). **Fix:** bind `have hXg : X ⊆ E(G.mulTilde n)
  := hX.subset_ground` (a one-line defeq nudge via `show`/ascription), then feed
  `hXg` to `inter_eq_right.mpr` everywhere.
- **General lesson:** a `restrict`-built matroid's `.E` reads back as the *restrict
  ground*, not the syntactic `E(G̃)`; ascribe the subset hypothesis to the graph's
  edge set once and reuse it. Sibling of the `Matroid.Union`-ground-is-`univ` entry.
- **Status:** resolved — `hXg` ascription landed; no mirror needed.

### [resolved] `[matroid]` `Graph.orientation.signedIncMatrix` needs `[DecidableEq α]` + `[DecidablePred (· ∈ E(G))]` inside a `noncomputable def` body
- **Where it bit:** `Graph.kFrameRow` in `BodyBar/KFrame.lean` (Phase 14
  `def:k-frame-matroid`). The `k`-frame row reuses
  `D.signedIncMatrix K e` (the signed graph-incidence row that
  `cycleMatroidRep` represents `cycleMatroid` by), which carries
  `[DecidableEq α]` and `[DecidablePred (· ∈ E(G))]` (via `update` and
  the edge-set `dite`). Those don't follow from anything in scope, and a
  `def` body can't open with the `classical` *tactic*.
- **Fix:** supply both as term-level `letI`s at the top of the `def`
  body — `letI : DecidableEq α := Classical.decEq α` and
  `letI : DecidablePred (· ∈ E(G)) := Classical.decPred _` — keeping the
  `def` signature free of the binders (the matroid is `noncomputable`
  anyway, so the choice is harmless). Cleaner than threading the
  instances through the signature; reuse for any Phase-14/15 def that
  builds a `signedIncMatrix`-based row.
- **Downstream wrinkle (Phase 14 assembly):** a lemma whose *statement*
  carries these `letI` decidability binders (e.g.
  `finrank_span_signedIncMatrix_eq_cycleMatroid_rk`) won't always rewrite
  into a sibling goal via `rw [lemma]`, because the goal's synthesized
  decidability instance need not be defeq-by-`rw` to the `Classical.dec*`
  one in the lemma's type. Fix: peel the surrounding structure with
  `congr 1` and discharge the residual block with `exact lemma …` (used
  in `finrank_blockPiSpanOn`).
- **Status:** resolved (project-local; matches how `cycleMatroidRep`
  itself opens with `classical` in a `Rep` field).

### [resolved] `[matroid]` `Graph.Components` (the `Set (Graph α β)` of components) has no `Finite`/`Fintype` instance under `[Finite α]`
- **Where it bit:** `Graph.le_mul_cycleMatroid_rk_of_isSparse_restrict` in
  `BodyBar/TreePacking.lean` (Phase 13 reverse direction). The
  component-decomposition sum needs `[Fintype ↥H.Components]` (for the
  skew-family rank-additivity lemma `IsSkewFamily.sum_eRk_eq_eRk_iUnion`,
  which is `[Fintype η]`), but `[Finite α]` does not synthesize even
  `Finite ↥H.Components` — `Set.toFinite` on a `Set (Graph α β)` needs a
  `Finite` subtype, which isn't automatic from finite vertices.
- **Fix:** derive it explicitly via
  `components_eq_walkable_image : G.Components = G.walkable '' V(G)` and
  `(Set.toFinite V(H)).image _`, then `.fintype` for the `Fintype`. Phases
  14–15 reaching for the component sum should reuse this two-line bridge.
- **Status:** resolved (project-local; the `apnelson1/Matroid` `Graph`
  API has no general instance).

### [resolved] `[matroid]` `apnelson1/Matroid`'s `WIP/{Union,Submodular}.lean` are unbuildable at every ref — Phase 12 matroid-union mirror (L2a + L2b-union + L2b-rado + L2b-partition all ported; **Phase 12 complete**, all `matroid-union.tex` nodes green)
- **Where it bit:** Phase 12 Layer 1. The plan was to vendor the
  matroid-union machinery (`Matroid.Union`, `union_indep_iff'`, Edmonds
  `matroid_partition'` / `matroid_partition_eRk'`, plus its
  `PolymatroidFn` / `ofSubmodular` / `polymatroid_rank_eq` dependency)
  from `apnelson1/Matroid`'s repo-root `WIP/{Union,Submodular}.lean`,
  fixing one renamed import. The Phase-12 prereq audit recorded these
  as "0 sorries, just import."
- **Friction:** the audit was wrong against every pushed revision.
  Verified at our pin `e6852ce` and at the latest upstream `main`
  (`f3f7df3`): (1) `WIP/Submodular.lean` imports
  `Matroid.Constructions.IsCircuitAxioms`, a module that has **never**
  been committed on any branch (`git log --all -- …/IsCircuitAxioms.lean`
  is empty); (2) its `ofSubmodular` is built on `FinsetCircuitMatroid.*`,
  which is **commented out** in `Matroid/Axioms/Circuit.lean` (>1 yr).
  So `Matroid.Union` etc. are live code at no ref. The only branch with
  a live `ofSubmodular` (`galois`, 2024) has **no** union machinery and
  is on Lean `v4.10` (vs our `v4.30`), so unusable as a pin.
- **Resolution (2026-06, user's call): formalize locally** (option b)
  under `CombinatorialRigidity/Matroid/`, *not* wait for upstream.
  Crucially, the WIP files are **0-sorry** — the proofs exist; the
  blocker is purely that they sit on the superseded
  `FinsetCircuitMatroid` constructor. So the work is a **rebase onto the
  live `FiniteCircuitMatroid`** (the constructor `Graph.cycleMatroid`
  already uses), retaining Peter Nelson's authorship — not a
  from-scratch proof. The package's `Matroid.Intersection` is also live
  (0 sorry), giving an alternative union-from-intersection route; the
  choice is made by a Phase-12 Layer-1 spike. Apache-2.0 throughout, so
  no license issue; attribution via per-file headers + blueprint credit
  (see `DESIGN.md` *Local mirror of the matroid-union subsystem*).
- **Status:** **resolved** — Phase 12 complete (all four port layers
  green/0-sorry, every `matroid-union.tex` node green). See
  `notes/Phase12.md` *Prerequisites audit* + *Layer plan*. Filing an
  upstream courtesy issue (offer the rebase back) is an optional
  follow-up, not blocking. The *downstream* consumption boundary
  (Set/Finset + `rk`/`eRk`/`ncard` rank flavor as Phases 13–15 consume
  this layer) is a cross-cutting design concern, captured in `DESIGN.md`
  *Set/Finset and rank-flavor boundary at the matroid layer (Phases
  13–15)* — not duplicated here per this file's scope rule.
- **L2a progress (2026-06):** `Constructions/Submodular.lean` landed
  green, 0 sorry — `Submodular`, `ofSubmodular` (rebased onto
  `FiniteCircuitMatroid` via the Set-lift `∃ C₀, ↑C₀ = C ∧ Minimal P C₀`),
  `circuit_ofSubmodular_iff`, `indep_ofSubmodular_iff`, plus the three
  revived helpers (`setOf_minimal_antichain`,
  `exists_minimal_satisfying_subset`, `intro_elimination_nontrivial`).
  Two porting gotchas, both bounded: (i) the file's minimal import set
  (`Matroid.*` + `Order.Lattice`) does **not** transitively expose
  `linarith` — needed an explicit `import Mathlib.Tactic.Linarith` (the
  WIP got it via heavier imports); (ii) `LinearOrderedAddCommMonoid` was
  refactored out of this mathlib, so `Submodular`'s bound decomposes to
  `[AddCommMonoid β] [LinearOrder β]` — and the `unusedArguments` linter
  then forces dropping the order-compat `IsOrderedAddMonoid β` (the
  predicate statement uses only `+` and `≤`).
- **L2a polymatroid (2026-06):** `PolymatroidFn` (as a `Prop` structure,
  matching the `[AddCommMonoid β] [LinearOrder β]` split above instead of
  the WIP's `LinearOrderedAddCommMonoid`), `ofPolymatroidFn`, and
  `indep_ofPolymatroidFn_iff` + `ofPolymatroidFn_nonempty_indep_le` landed
  green, 0 sorry. One gotcha: the WIP's `@[simps!]` on `ofPolymatroidFn`
  generates a `..._Indep` projection simp lemma that unfolds the matroid's
  `Indep` field, putting `indep_ofPolymatroidFn_iff`'s LHS out of
  simp-normal form (hard `simpNF` lint error). Fix: restrict to
  `@[simps! E]`, matching the `ofSubmodular` precedent in the same file —
  only the ground-set projection is wanted as a simp lemma.
- **L2a rank lemma (2026-06):** `polymatroid_rank_eq` (+ private
  `polymatroid_rank_eq_on_indep`) landed green, 0 sorry, closing L2a.
  Four porting points, all bounded: (i) the WIP's `Matroid.r` is now
  `Matroid.rk` (the def + every dot-lemma); the relevant renames were
  `Indep.eRk → Indep.eRk_eq_encard`, `IsBasis.r`/`IsBasis.rk_eq_rk →
  IsBasis.ncard_eq_rk` (note: the new lemma is the `ncard = rk`
  *direction*, so the rewrite gives `(↑B).ncard`, cleared with
  `Set.ncard_coe_finset`, lowercase `f`). (ii) The WIP's `self_eq_add_left`
  simp lemma was removed from this mathlib; the `a = 0 + a` residual it
  handled is closed by `simp only [zero_add, true_and]` directly (drop the
  lemma, no replacement needed). (iii) two imports the WIP got transitively
  are not in the minimal set: `Mathlib.Tactic.Cases` (for `induction'`,
  here rewritten to non-prime `induction … using … with | @h₁ Y hY IH`)
  and `Mathlib.Data.Finset.CastCard` (`cast_card_union` / `cast_card_sdiff`).
  (iv) the WIP's two `-- thanks aesop` `simp_all only [...]` lemma lists
  carried stale names (`ofPolymatroidFn_Indep`, `IndepMatroid.ofFinset_indep`)
  from the old `IndepMatroid.ofFinset`-based construction — our matroid is
  `FiniteCircuitMatroid`-built, so those projections don't exist; deleting
  them from the lists leaves `simp_all` closing both goals unchanged. General
  lesson: when porting an aesop-generated `simp_all only [long list]`, treat
  construction-specific projection names in the list as the first thing to
  prune on an "unknown identifier" — the surrounding `simp_all` is usually
  robust to their removal.
- **L2b union construction (2026-06):** `Constructions/Union.lean` —
  `AdjIndep'` + `adjMap_indep_iff'`, `Matroid.Union` / `Matroid.union`,
  `Union_empty`, `union_indep_aux{,'}`, `union_indep_iff` /
  `union_indep_iff'` — landed green, 0 sorry (partition rank theorem
  deferred to a follow-up commit). The construction reuses the live
  `Matroid.Constructions.Matching` (`adjMap` / `AdjIndep` / `IsMatching`)
  and mathlib's `Matroid.sum'`, both unchanged. Porting points, all
  bounded: (i) `Pairwise (Disjoint on t)` failed with *"Unknown identifier
  `on`"* — the ` on ` infix is `scoped` in `Function` (`Function.onFun`),
  so the file needs `open Function` (the WIP got it via a broader open).
  (ii) The WIP's `union_indep_aux'` depended on
  `Matroid.ForMathlib.Set.exists_pairwiseDisjoint_iUnion_eq`, which is
  *commented out* in the live `ForMathlib/Set.lean` (third bit-rot point
  beyond the audit, matching the L2a commented-`ForMathlib/Finset.lean`
  pattern) — reconstructed verbatim as a `private` lemma in the file.
  (iii) The WIP's `Union_empty` (`IsEmpty ι ⇒ Union = loopyOn`) leaned on
  two brittle `simp [adjMap, IndepMatroid.ofFinset, …]`-unfold lists that
  no longer close post-`FiniteCircuitMatroid`; reproved cleanly via
  `eq_loopyOn_iff` + finitarity (`adjMap` is `Finitary`), reducing to: a
  singleton `{x}` independent set would `IsMatching`-match into the empty
  type `ι × α`, contradicting `Set.bijOn_empty_iff_left`. (iv) Followed the
  project `[Finite α]`-in-signature convention over the WIP's `[Fintype α]`
  (bridge `haveI : Fintype β := Fintype.ofFinite β` inside
  `adjMap_indep_iff'`), clearing the `unusedFintypeInType` linter; added
  focus dots + the `simp?`-suggested `simp only` set to clear the
  `style.{multiGoal,flexible}` compile warnings.
- **L2b dependency re-scope (2026-06): the partition-rank target is blocked on
  an un-ported Rado/Hall sub-tree — Phase-12 audit residual.** Planning the
  partition-rank commit (`matroid_partition'` / `matroid_partition_eRk'`)
  surfaced a dependency the *Prerequisites audit* missed: their bridge
  `polymatroid_of_adjMap` (`WIP/Union.lean:258`) builds its matching via the
  **sufficiency** direction of Rado's theorem, calling `(rado M A).mpr …`
  (`WIP/Union.lean:339`). Two decoys to avoid: (i) the live
  `Matroid.Intersection.rado_necessary` is only the *easy* direction; the full
  `rado` / `rado_iff` / `rado_sufficient` there are **commented-out Lean-3**
  resting on further dead machinery (`partition_matroid_on`,
  `exists_common_ind_with_isFlat_right`). (ii) The live `rado` exists *only* in
  the **back half of the same `WIP/Submodular.lean`** L2a ported from
  (`:891`, Oxley Thm 11.2.2) — L2a stopped at `polymatroid_rank_eq` (`:~296`)
  and never reached it. `rado` rests on a self-contained, 0-sorry but ~420-line
  sub-tree (`:323–942`): `generalized_halls_marriage` (deps all in the
  L2a-ported surface), the `PartialTransversal` structure + ~30 lemmas, the
  `Transversal`/`Transverses` family, then `rado` / `rado_v2`. **Lesson:** the
  prereq-audit's "0 sorry, just rebase" reading covered only the *front* of
  `WIP/Submodular.lean`; the proof-by-grep of a vendored file's dependency
  graph must follow `.mpr`/`.1` projections of *named theorems* into the rest
  of the source, not just the import list. L2b re-scoped into L2b-rado
  (port the sub-tree) + L2b-partition (the two targets); see `notes/Phase12.md`
  *Current state* / *Layer plan* / *Hand-off*. No Lean changed this commit.
- **L2b-rado infrastructure (2026-06):** ported `WIP/Submodular.lean:323–740`
  (`generalized_halls_marriage` + `'`; the `PartialTransversal` family) into
  `Constructions/Submodular.lean`, green/0-sorry. Porting points: (i) **the WIP
  source does not build**, so its signatures are *untrustworthy* — several
  `of_fun_*` / `move_*` lemmas were missing the `[DecidableEq α]` /
  `[DecidableEq (ι × α)]` / `[Fintype ι]` instances their bodies need (`univ`,
  `Finset.filter`-decidability, `I = univ`). Lesson: when porting from a
  non-building file, treat every instance binder as a *guess* and let the
  elaborator tell you what's actually required; the `f i` "type mismatch ι vs
  ↑I" errors were a symptom of an instance failure earlier in elaboration, not
  a real binder bug. (ii) `ne_of_mem_of_notMem → ne_of_mem_of_not_mem`.
  (iii) `Fintype.choose` / `Fintype.choose_spec` need `import
  Mathlib.Data.Fintype.Inv` (not in the minimal `Matroid.*` set). (iv) `runLinter`
  gate: dropped `@[simp]` on `of_fun_mem_edges_iff` (simp-can-prove-this) and
  switched `def → lemma` on `of_fun_{left,right}_eq` (`defLemma` + `docBlame`);
  trimmed genuinely-unused `[DecidableEq α]` off `fun_{mem,inj,injective}`.
  (v) `push_neg → push Not`; `simp_wf` in the `decreasing_by` now does nothing
  (removed).
- **L2b-rado warnings sweep (2026-06):** the L2b-rado port above shipped with
  ~24 compile-time style warnings (`unusedSimpArgs` / `flexible` /
  `unusedDecidableInType` / `unusedFintypeInType`); per the warnings-clean
  policy these were all cleared in an amend, file still green/0-sorry. Mostly
  mechanical (drop `tsub_le_iff_right` + `sub_add_cancel` unused-simp pairs in
  the calc; `simp [le_eq_subset] → simp only`; drop `exists_and_right`; drop
  unused `[DecidableEq ι]` from `generalized_halls_marriage{,'}` /
  `card_eq_iff_total`, opening `classical` where the body then needs decidable
  `Function.update` — including a `classical` *inside* `decreasing_by`). The one
  non-obvious step: clearing `unusedFintypeInType` on the WF-recursive
  `generalized_halls_marriage` (swap `[Fintype ι] → [Finite ι]`) breaks its
  `termination_by ∑ i, …` measure, since `Fintype.ofFinite` is a *def* not an
  `instance`; fixed by prefixing the measure `termination_by haveI :=
  Fintype.ofFinite ι; ∑ i, (A i).card`. **Lifted to:** TACTICS-QUIRKS § 16(d).
- **L2b-rado finish (2026-06):** ported `WIP/Submodular.lean:742–942` (the
  `Transversal`/`Transverses`/`Transverses'` family, `rado_v2`, `rado`) into
  `Constructions/Submodular.lean`, green/0-sorry; `rado` is `lem:rado`. Renames
  beyond the standard `Matroid.r → rk` chase: (i) **`IsRkFinite.submod` now takes
  the second set explicitly** — `hX.submod (Y : Set α)`, not a second finiteness
  proof (the WIP passed `(M.IsRkFinite.of_finite …)` as the 2nd arg; that arg is
  now `Y : Set α`). (ii) `Indep.r → Indep.rk_eq_ncard`, `Indep.eRk →
  Indep.eRk_eq_encard`, `M.IsRkFinite.of_finite → M.isRkFinite_of_finite`,
  `Set.ncard_coe_Finset → Set.ncard_coe_finset`. (iii) `[Fintype ι] → [Finite ι]`
  + `haveI := Fintype.ofFinite ι` (statements have no `Fintype.card ι`); the
  `Transverses (image f univ)`-shaped lemmas keep `[Fintype ι]` since `univ :
  Finset ι` is in the *type*. (iv) `runLinter`/warnings: dropped the bit-rotted
  `[DecidableEq ι]` on `Transversal` (`unusedArguments` — the def is decidability-
  free) and the now-unused `[DecidableEq ι]`/`[Fintype α]` on `rado`/`rado_v2`;
  `push_neg → push Not`; `Finset.toSet → (· : Set α)`. (v) An over-aggressive
  `simpa [mem_image, mem_univ, true_and] using x.property` collapsed the hyp to
  `True`; replaced with `obtain ⟨i, _, hi⟩ := mem_image.mp x.property`.
- **L2b-partition finish (2026-06, closes Phase 12):** ported
  `WIP/Union.lean`'s `polymatroid_of_adjMap` (the bridge — `adjMap`-matroid as
  `ofPolymatroidFn` of `f Y = M.rk (N Adj Y)`; sufficiency direction calls
  `(rado …).mpr`), `adjMap_rank_eq`, `sum'_eRk_eq_eRk_sum{_on_indep}` /
  `sum'_rk_eq_rk_sum`, and `matroid_partition'` / `matroid_partition_eRk'`
  (node `thm:matroid-partition-rank`) into `Constructions/Union.lean`,
  green/0-sorry. Also added `PolymatroidFn_of_zero` to `Submodular.lean` (the
  `isEmpty α` branch of `polymatroid_of_adjMap` needs it). Warnings-clean sweep
  (~28 warnings on first build, same class as the L2b-rado sweep): dropped many
  bit-rotted unused `simp only` args (`Classical.not_imp`, `le_eq_subset`,
  `mem_setOf_eq`, `N`/`N_singleton`/`he'` set-aliases, `hf`/`hN`); `[Fintype α]
  → [Finite α]` + `haveI := Fintype.ofFinite α` on the five theorems whose type
  has no `Fintype.card α` (`matroid_partition'` keeps `[Fintype α]` — `Finset.univ
  : Finset α` is in its type); `Finset.toSet → (· : Set _)`,
  `ncard_image_of_injOn → InjOn.ncard_image`; long-line wraps. `lake lint`
  flagged `sum'_eRk_eq_eRk_sum_on_indep` `@[simp]` as simp-can-prove (the general
  `sum'_eRk_eq_eRk_sum` subsumes it) — dropped the `@[simp]` (stays callable by
  name). `#print axioms` on all four targets = `propext`/`Classical.choice`/
  `Quot.sound` only.

### [open] Chaining `LinearIndepOn.insert` from `linearIndepOn_empty` produces `insert _ ∅` shapes that don't unify with `{_, _, _}`
- **Where it bit:** Case-2 (LI on the three new edges) of
  `typeII_edgeSetRowIndependent_extend` in `MatroidIdentification.lean`.
  Three `LinearIndepOn.insert` calls chained on
  `linearIndepOn_empty ℝ ((typeII G' a b c).rigidityRow p_ext)`
  produce a `LinearIndepOn ℝ row (insert _ (insert _ (insert _ ∅)))`
  result. Lean's set notation `{newA, newB, newC}` desugars to
  `insert newA (insert newB {newC})` — the innermost is
  `Set.singleton newC`, not `insert newC ∅`, and the two are
  *propositionally* equal but not defeq (`Set.singleton c = {x | x =
  c}` while `Set.insert c ∅ = {x | x = c ∨ False}`). The chain's
  elaboration fails with a "Type mismatch" error citing the
  metavariable-laden `insert ?m (insert ?m (insert ?m ∅))`.
- **Friction:** workaround is to rewrite the inner `{newC}` to
  `insert newC ∅` before the chain via
  `rw [← LawfulSingleton.insert_empty_eq newEdgeC]`. With the goal
  in the all-`insert`-with-`∅` form, the chain elaborates cleanly.
  Pair-of-set rewrites later (`Submodule.mem_span_singleton`,
  `Submodule.mem_span_pair`) then need `Set.image_insert_eq`,
  `Set.image_empty`, `Set.image_singleton`,
  `LawfulSingleton.insert_empty_eq` in the simp set to undo the
  `insert _ ∅` form back to `{_}` form.
- **Proposed fix:** none upstream — this is a defeq edge of Set's
  `Insert` / `Singleton` instances. Worth lifting to TACTICS-QUIRKS
  if a third caller hits it.
- **Status:** open (project-internal note).

### [resolved] `Polynomial.X` in a `set := ... .det` binding needs an explicit type ascription
- **Where it bit:** `exists_affinelySpanning_rigid_placement` in
  `RigidityMatroid.lean` (Phase 6, original site) and
  `finite_setOf_not_linearIndependent_rows_along_affine_path` in
  `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean` (Phase 8, second site).
- **Resolution:** annotate the literal explicitly,
  `(Polynomial.X : Polynomial ℝ) • …`. Two-site recurrence triggered
  promote-to-TACTICS-QUIRKS at post-Phase-8 cleanup D2.
- **Lifted to:** `TACTICS-QUIRKS.md` § 15 *Bare `Polynomial.X`
  (or `0`, `1`) needs explicit type ascription in `let`/`set` of a
  `Polynomial`-valued expression*.

### [open] `h ▸ ...` substitutes through ambient terms, oversubstituting when the goal already mentions the rewritten side
- **Where it bit:** `Function.Injective.eventually_update_of_continuousAt`
  in the new `Mathlib/Topology/Separation/Hausdorff.lean` mirror. I had
  `h_eq0 : update p₀ c (f x₀) = p₀` and wanted to produce
  `Injective (update p₀ c (f x₀))` from `hp₀ : Injective p₀` via
  `h_eq0 ▸ hp₀` (or `.symm ▸ hp₀`). Lean inferred a motive that *also*
  rewrote `p₀` inside the surrounding expected type, producing the
  oversubstituted `Injective (update (update p₀ c (f x₀)) c (f x₀))`.
- **Friction:** `▸` in term mode picks the most general motive against
  the expected type from the calling context. When that expected type
  itself contains both sides of the rewrite, `▸` ambiguity bites and
  produces an "oversubstituted" type.
- **Proposed fix / workaround:** isolate the rewrite into a `have`
  whose stated type fixes the motive:
  `have hinj₀ : Injective (update p₀ c (f x₀)) := by rw [h_eq0]; exact hp₀`.
  Then pass `hinj₀` into the outer term. The tactic-mode `rw` does not
  suffer from motive ambiguity because the goal at that point is just
  the stated type, not the surrounding calling context.
- **Status:** open (project-internal note). Promote to
  `TACTICS-QUIRKS.md` if the same shape bites in a second proof.
  Recognition: `▸ ...` errors with "expected type" showing a
  doubly-substituted term (the rewrite target appears nested inside
  itself).

### [resolved] typeII reverse Henneberg move: Laman preservation requires a non-trivial choice
- **Where it bit:** Phase 3 close, while planning
  `IsLaman.exists_typeI_or_typeII_reverse`.
- **Friction:** The Phase-3-start hand-off identified "find non-adjacent
  neighbors among the three degree-3 neighbors" as the tricky piece.
  That part is straightforward (sparsity at `{v, a, b, c}` ⇒ ≤ 2 edges
  among `{a, b, c}` ⇒ a non-adjacent pair exists; see
  `IsSparse.exists_nonadj_among_three_neighbors`). The genuinely hard
  piece is showing that *for some* non-adjacent pair `{a, b}`, the
  reconstructed `G' := (G - v) + edge(a, b)` is Laman. An arbitrary
  non-adjacent pair does **not** suffice: concrete counter-example,
  `V = {v, x, y, z, w₁, w₂}` with edges `{v-x, v-y, v-z, x-z, x-w₁,
  x-w₂, y-w₁, y-w₂, w₁-w₂}` (Laman, `v` of degree 3 to `{x, y, z}`,
  `{x, y}` non-adjacent), and `G' = (G-v) + xy` violates sparsity at
  the 4-set `{x, y, w₁, w₂}` (6 edges where `2·4 - 3 = 5`). Picking
  the other non-adjacent pair `{y, z}` does work — but the
  combinatorial choice is the heart of Henneberg's classical theorem
  and requires several pages of contradiction/blocker reasoning.
- **Resolution:** Phase 5 delivered the Laman-preservation half via
  the Henneberg blocker argument (the per-pair tight-blocker witness
  combined via `IsTightOn.union_inter`); Phase 7 lifted the proof
  core to `IsSparse` (`IsSparse.typeII_reverse_blocker` +
  `IsSparse.exists_typeI_or_typeII_reverse`) and re-presented the
  Laman conclusion in flat form
  (`IsLaman.exists_typeI_or_typeII_reverse`, Henneberg.lean) as a thin
  shell over the sparse version. The operation-form intermediates that
  Phase 5 routed through (`exists_typeI_or_typeII_iso`,
  `IsLaman.typeII_reverse_blocker`, `typeII_reverse_witness_or_blocker`)
  were deleted in Phase 7 Commit 6.
- **Status:** resolved (Phase 5 + Phase 7 Commit 6).

### [resolved] No mathlib `LinearIndependent ![u, v] ↔ det ≠ 0` in dim 2
- **Where it bit:** `exists_affinelySpanning_rigid_placement_two` in
  `RigidityMatroid.lean`. Inside the per-triple finiteness argument
  we needed: from the quadratic determinant `u 0 * v 1 - u 1 * v 0 ≠
  0` (with `u, v : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)`) deduce
  `LinearIndependent ℝ ![u, v]`.
- **Resolution:** the right primitive at d-general is
  `Matrix.linearIndependent_rows_of_det_ne_zero` (in
  `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Determinant/Basic.lean`), bridged to
  `EuclideanSpace` via `WithLp.linearEquiv` and
  `LinearMap.linearIndependent_iff`. The Phase 6 task-4 d-general lift
  replaced the dim-2 private helper `linearIndependent_pair_of_det_ne_zero`
  with the project-private bridge `affineIndependent_of_difference_det_ne_zero`
  that consumes the row-LI lemma directly. The dim-2 helper has been
  retired entirely.
- **Lesson:** same as the `finSuccAboveEquiv` and `LinearMap.ltoFun`
  finds — mathlib's matrix-determinant API is denser than the dim-2
  case-by-case API. When the d-general statement is available, use
  it; the dim-2 specialisation collapses by `rfl` or one-line glue.
- **Lifted to:** TACTICS-GOLF § 3 *Search mathlib before mirroring*
  (one of three case studies cited there).

### [resolved] No packaged `ℝ`-linear injection `Module.Dual ℝ M →ₗ[ℝ] (M → ℝ)`
- **Where it bit:** `edgeSetRowIndependent_iff_linearIndepOn_rigidityRow`
  in `RigidityMatroid.lean`. We needed to bridge `LinearIndepOn` of a
  family in `(Framework V d → ℝ)` (the blueprint's set-of-functions
  formulation of `EdgeSetRowIndependent`) with `LinearIndepOn` of the
  same family viewed in `Module.Dual ℝ (Framework V d)` (where
  `LinearMap.dualMap` rank identities apply).
- **Resolution:** mathlib *does* ship this — as
  `LinearMap.ltoFun R M N A : (M →ₗ[R] N) →ₗ[A] M → N`
  (`Mathlib.Algebra.Module.LinearMap.Basic`). Instantiate
  `R = N = A = ℝ` for the dual case. Injectivity is
  `DFunLike.coe_injective`. The original ~16-line private
  `dualToFunₗ` + `dualToFunₗ_apply` + `dualToFunₗ_injective` scaffold
  collapses to a single call. The Phase 6 task-2 simplification pass
  pulled this in (commit landing alongside the task-2 cleanup);
  the bridge lemma is now 7 lines total.
- **Lesson:** same as the `finSuccAboveEquiv` find — sweep
  `lean_loogle` against the type signature you actually need before
  rolling a project-local helper. The exact type
  `(_ →ₗ[_] _) →ₗ[_] (_ → _)` returned `LinearMap.ltoFun` on the
  first try.
- **Lifted to:** TACTICS-GOLF § 3 *Search mathlib before mirroring*.

### [resolved] `congr_fun` does not apply to `LinearMap` (`Module.Dual` instance)
- **Where it bit:** `typeI_edgeSetRowIndependent_extend` in
  `MatroidIdentification.lean`. The hypothesis `hcd : c • row newEdgeA +
  d • row newEdgeB = 0` is an equation in
  `Module.Dual ℝ (Framework (Option V) 2) = Framework (Option V) 2 →ₗ[ℝ] ℝ`,
  i.e., a `LinearMap`, not a raw `Function`. The first instinct
  `congr_fun hcd test_motion` to extract the per-input equation
  errored with `Application type mismatch`.
- **Resolution:** `DFunLike.congr_fun hcd test_motion`. `LinearMap`
  is `FunLike`, not literally `Function`; even though it coerces to
  one, `congr_fun` needs a literal `Pi`-typed equation. The error
  message does not flag the `FunLike`-vs-`Function` distinction.
  Sibling of the EuclideanSpace = PiLp gotcha (TACTICS-QUIRKS § 9):
  both fall under "acts like a function but isn't literally one."
- **Status:** resolved (project-internal lesson). Same gotcha applies
  to `LinearEquiv`, `AlgHom`, `ContinuousLinearMap`, etc.
- **Lifted to:** TACTICS-QUIRKS § 12 *`congr_fun` does not apply to
  `LinearMap` (or any `FunLike`)*.

### [resolved] `Set.Finite.subset (finite_setOf ...)` leaves metavariables when leading-coeff is the only resolved unknown
- **Where it bit:** `exists_affinelySpanning_rigid_placement_two` in
  `RigidityMatroid.lean`. Inside the per-triple finiteness proof we
  applied `Set.Finite.subset (finite_zeros_quadratic h_γ_ne)` to bound
  the bad-`t` set by the polynomial zero set. `h_γ_ne : γ ≠ 0`
  pins down `γ` in the conclusion's implicit args, but `β` and `α`
  stay as metavariables — Lean leaves three goals (the subset relation
  plus two `⊢ ℝ` placeholders), and the linter (multiGoal-style)
  flags every subsequent step as touching multiple goals.
- **Resolution:** dissolved by the Phase 6 task-4 d-general lift. The
  private `finite_zeros_quadratic` helper retired; the d-general proof
  uses `(Polynomial.finite_setOf_isRoot hP_ne).subset h_bad_sub` with
  a *named* `P : Polynomial ℝ` whose coefficients are fully determined
  by the surrounding `set` bindings. The "unresolved metavariables on
  applying a `Finite.subset (finite_…)`" symptom was a side-effect of
  three free scalars (`γ, β, α`) being passed to a helper that did not
  capture them; the d-general matrix form (`M₀, M₁`) bundles them
  into named matrices, and the polynomial is a single named object.
- **Lesson:** when reaching for a quadratic/cubic/degree-`d` zero-set
  finiteness, prefer `Polynomial.finite_setOf_isRoot` on a fully-named
  `P : Polynomial R` over a hand-rolled `finite_zeros_quadratic`-style
  helper that takes free coefficients as arguments. Mathlib's
  matrix-of-polynomial machinery (`coeff_det_X_add_C_card`,
  `natDegree_det_X_add_C_le`) builds `P` from named matrices, which
  pins down all the implicit arguments at the apply site.

### [resolved] `AffineIndependent` ↔ `LinearIndependent` reindex from `{x : Fin 3 // x ≠ 0}` to `Fin 2`
- **Where it bit:** `exists_affinelySpanning_rigid_placement_two` in
  `RigidityMatroid.lean`. After `affineIndependent_iff_linearIndependent_vsub
  ℝ ![pt t a, pt t b, pt t c] 0` the goal is LI of a family
  indexed by `{x : Fin 3 // x ≠ 0}`, but the natural witness is
  `LinearIndependent ℝ ![u, v]` on `Fin 2`.
- **Resolution:** mathlib *does* ship the canonical reindex — just not
  packaged in the obvious place: `finSuccAboveEquiv (p : Fin (n + 1)) :
  Fin n ≃ { x : Fin (n + 1) // x ≠ p }` in
  `Mathlib.Logic.Equiv.Fin.Basic` plus `linearIndependent_equiv` in
  `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.LinearIndependent.Defs`. Composing the two
  rewrites the goal directly to `LinearIndependent ℝ ![p_b -ᵥ p_a,
  p_c -ᵥ p_a]`, no hand-rolled reindex needed. The earlier *Proposed
  fix* (mirror a 15-line bridge under `CombinatorialRigidity/Mathlib/`)
  was premature — the right primitives were already upstream; we just
  hadn't searched for them. Discovery routed through
  `EuclideanGeometry.oangle_ne_zero_and_ne_pi_iff_affineIndependent`'s
  proof in mathlib, which uses the same pair.
- **Lesson:** before mirror-ing a bridge under
  `CombinatorialRigidity/Mathlib/`, sweep `lean_loogle` / `lean_leanfinder`
  for the canonical primitives. The "mirror it ourselves" instinct
  bloats the project surface; mathlib's API for `Fin`-indexed families
  is denser than it looks.
- **Lifted to:** TACTICS-GOLF § 3 *Search mathlib before mirroring*.

### [resolved] No mathlib bridge `AffineIndependent ℝ p ↔ LinearIndependent ℝ (p̄ = (p,1))`
- **Where it bit:** Phase 17, `lem:affine-indep-iff` in
  `Molecular/Extensor.lean`. KT's homogeneous coordinatization
  `p ↦ (p,1)` needs "affinely independent ⇔ homogenized family linearly
  independent". mathlib has the *vsub* form
  (`affineIndependent_iff_linearIndependent_vsub`) but no `(p,1)`-snoc
  homogenization bridge (searched: no `Homogenize`/`snoc`+`AffineIndependent`).
- **Resolution:** no mirror needed — `affineIndependent_iff` (the
  `V → V` self-affine-space characterization: affine indep ⇔ every `w`
  with `∑w=0` and `∑ w•p=0` is zero) *is* the homogenized
  linear-independence condition once you `linearIndependent_iff'` the
  RHS: the last homogeneous coordinate of `∑ w•p̄ = 0` is `∑w=0`, the
  first `d` are `∑ w•p=0`. Split coordinatewise via
  `Fin.lastCases` / `homogenize_last` / `homogenize_castSucc`. The
  `def`-bridge `homogenize := Fin.snoc p 1` is project-specific (KT
  coordinatization), so the lemma stays project-internal in
  `Molecular/`, not mirrored. Determinant form on top via
  `Matrix.linearIndependent_rows_iff_isUnit` + `isUnit_iff_isUnit_det`
  + `isUnit_iff_ne_zero`. The row-identity step `(fun i => …) =
  (Matrix.of …).row` is exactly mathlib's `Matrix.of_row` (used reversed,
  with the function given explicitly so the rewrite metavariable
  resolves) — Phase 17-cleanup B5/B7 replaced the original anonymous
  `show … from rfl` with `← Matrix.of_row _`; a residual bare `rfl`
  still bridges the `.det` side (`Matrix.of`-applied vs bare det, defeq).

### [open] `AffineSubspace.nonempty_of_affineSpan_eq_top` takes `(k V P)` explicit

- **Where it bit:** `trivialMotions_three_le_finrank_of_affinelySpanning_two`
  in `TrivialMotions.lean`. Extracting a vertex `v₀ : V` from
  `hp : affineSpan ℝ (Set.range p) = ⊤` to pin down a contradiction
  with "p constant".
- **Friction:** the mathlib lemma sits inside an `AffineSubspace`
  namespace section where `(k V P)` are all explicit. To call it, you
  write `AffineSubspace.nonempty_of_affineSpan_eq_top _ _ _ hp` — three
  underscores plus the proof. With dot notation `hp.nonempty…` would be
  ambiguous (no syntactic anchor for the subject), so the long form is
  the only ergonomic option.
- **Proposed fix:** add a project helper `range_nonempty_of_affineSpan_eq_top`
  that fixes the `(ℝ, V, P)` and exposes a one-arg call, or change the
  upstream signature to make `(k V P)` implicit (they're recoverable
  from `Set.range p`'s element type). Either route would land a
  one-line site at every call.
- **Status:** open. Worked around with `_ _ _` underscores; revisit if
  the same pattern surfaces in the `(2, 3)`-sparsity-side proof or
  the affinely-spanning-rigid-placement lemma.

### [open] `fin_cases i` leaves `⟨n, ⋯⟩` rather than the literal `n`, blocking `rw`

- **Where it bit:** `trivialMotions_three_le_finrank_of_affinelySpanning_two`,
  `h_const : ∀ v, p v = p v₀`. After `ext i; fin_cases i` the goal was
  `(p v).ofLp ⟨0, ⋯⟩ = (p v₀).ofLp ⟨0, ⋯⟩`, but the hypotheses
  `h_const_pv0 v : (p v) 0 = -c 1 / c 2` carry the literal `0`. `rw`
  failed: "did not find an occurrence of the pattern `(p v).ofLp 0`".
- **Friction:** standard pattern-matching glitch — the `⟨0, ⋯⟩` view
  and the literal `0` view are not syntactically equal even though
  Lean prints them identically in some contexts. Worked around with
  `change (p v) 0 = (p v₀) 0` before each `rw`, which forces the
  rewrite-friendly form.
- **Proposed fix:** none upstream; this is a tactic-quirk note. If
  it bites again, document the `match i with | ⟨0, _⟩ => change _; rw …`
  idiom in `TACTICS-QUIRKS.md`.
- **Status:** open (project-internal note). Worth promoting to
  `TACTICS-QUIRKS.md` if it surfaces a third time.

### [open] Defining the 2×2 90° rotation via `Matrix.toEuclideanLin` blocks coordinate simp

- **Where it bit:** `rotJTwo` in `TrivialMotions.lean`. The natural
  first attempt was `noncomputable def rotJTwo := Matrix.toEuclideanLin !![0, -1; 1, 0]`,
  which makes the simp lemmas `rotJTwo_apply_zero/one` non-`rfl`.
  Downstream `simp` calls then had to expand
  `Matrix.toEuclideanLin_apply`, `Matrix.mulVec`, `Matrix.dotProduct`,
  `Fin.sum_univ_two`, plus `Matrix.cons_val_zero/one` to reach
  `(rotJTwo v) 0 = -(v 1)`. Several iterations of "add more simp
  lemmas" failed to close the goal cleanly.
- **Friction:** the `Matrix.toEuclideanLin` route hides the explicit
  coordinate values behind a `Matrix.vecHead`/`Matrix.cons_val_*`
  chain that simp doesn't unfold uniformly without manual hints.
- **Proposed fix:** define `rotJTwo` directly via the `LinearMap`
  structure (`toFun := fun v => !₂[-(v 1), v 0]`, with hand-checked
  `map_add'` and `map_smul'`); then `rotJTwo_apply_zero/one` become
  `rfl`-simp lemmas and downstream `simp` closes coordinates without
  matrix-unfolding hints. We switched to this and it landed cleanly.
- **Status:** open (idiom note). Promote to `TACTICS-GOLF.md` as a
  "concrete 2×2 maps" subsection if a future phase introduces
  another explicit 2D map.

### [resolved] `Finset.univ.filter`-of-`Finset V` over `[Finite V]` triggers cascading instance synthesis friction
- **Where it bit:** Phase 7 Commit 17b's `IsSparse.maxBlock`
  (`Sparsity.lean`). Initial attempt defined `maxBlock X` as
  `(Finset.univ : Finset (Finset V)).filter (...).sup id` with
  `letI := Fintype.ofFinite V` inside the `by` body. Cascade:
  (a) `Finset.univ : Finset (Finset V)` needs `Fintype V` (via
  `Fintype.ofFinite`); (b) the `filter` predicate isn't auto-Decidable
  so needs `Classical.decPred`; (c) `Finset.sup` over `Finset V`
  needs `SemilatticeSup (Finset V)` which requires `DecidableEq V`;
  (d) `unfold IsSparse.maxBlock` in proofs exposes the `letI` /
  `Classical`-derived instance terms, and matching against
  proof-side `letI` / `classical` instances either fails defeq or
  times out at `whnf`.
- **Friction:** burned several iterations on `letI`/`haveI` and
  `open Classical in` variants before the `change` tactic timed out
  at 200000 heartbeats trying to match `hI.maxBlock X = F.sup id`.
- **Proposed fix:** define the family as a `Set V`-valued union
  (`⋃ S, ⋃ _, (↑S : Set V)`) — no `Finset.univ`, no `Fintype`, no
  `DecidablePred` — and convert to `Finset V` via
  `Set.Finite.toFinset` (justified by `[Finite V]` + subset of
  univ). The I-tightness proof then bridges to a Finset-join form
  in *one* spot, via `Finset.ext` + a local `Fintype.ofFinite V` +
  `classical`, isolating the instance friction. `mem_maxBlock`
  becomes the standard `Set.Finite.mem_toFinset` + `Set.mem_iUnion`
  + `and_assoc` simp recipe.
- **Status:** resolved (see `SimpleGraph.maxBlock` and surrounding
  lemmas in `Sparsity.lean`; the def was renamed from
  `IsSparse.maxBlock` to `SimpleGraph.maxBlock` in Phase 7 cleanup
  commit B3e). **Lifted to:** TACTICS-QUIRKS § new
  *Finset-of-Finsets over `[Finite V]`*.

### [open] `IsSparse` is not `Decidable`, blocking small-example proofs by `decide`
- **Where it bit:** Phase 2 attempt at `K₄ \ e` is Laman (deferred).
- **Friction:** `IsSparse` is `∀ s : Finset V, ℓ ≤ k * #s → (G.edgesIn ↑s).ncard + ℓ ≤ k * #s`,
  but `Set.ncard` is noncomputable. Even though the statement is morally
  decidable for finite `V`, we can't close the K₄ \ e example with
  `decide` and instead fall back on a finite case analysis.
- **Proposed fix:** add a project-internal `IsSparse'` companion that
  goes through `Finset.sym2` + `Finset.filter` for the count. Prove
  `IsSparse ↔ IsSparse'` under `[Fintype V] [DecidableRel G.Adj]`.
  Then concrete examples can use `decide`.
- **Status:** open. Acceptable for now (the K₄ \ e example was deferred
  to Phase 3 where Henneberg gives a one-liner), but worth doing if a
  later phase wants to mechanize more concrete graphs.

### ~~[open] No dim-2 "vector orthogonal to two LI vectors is zero" helper~~

- **Where it bit:** Three private helpers in `HennebergRigidity.lean`
  (`exists_not_mem_span_singleton_dim_two`,
  `inner_sub_perp_of_eq`, `eq_zero_of_orthogonal_dim_two`,
  lines 75–118) supporting the typeI/typeII rigidity-preservation
  proofs. The blueprint prose treats "orthogonal to two LI vectors
  in `ℝ²` is zero" as a one-clause math step; the Lean walks
  `Submodule.span_induction` on the orthogonal complement (~20 lines).
- **Friction:** the existing helper rebuilds "orthogonal complement
  of a spanning set is `⊥`" from scratch via `span_induction`
  instead of routing through `Submodule.span_eq_top` +
  `Submodule.top_orthogonal_eq_bot`. The combined dance is heavier
  than necessary.
- **Resolution:** `Submodule.isOrtho_span`
  (`Mathlib.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.Orthogonal`) already packages
  "two spans are orthogonal iff generators pairwise inner-zero", so
  the `span_induction` is unnecessary. The rewritten proof routes
  `span ![v₁, v₂] ⟂ span {u}` through `isOrtho_span` (generators-only
  side-condition) then `h_span_top` + `isOrtho_top_left`
  (`⊤ ⟂ V ↔ V = ⊥`) + `span_singleton_eq_bot` (`ℝ ∙ u = ⊥ ↔ u = 0`).
  21-line body → 10 lines, no mirror lemma needed.
- **Status:** resolved (2026-05-15). No mathlib mirror; pure rewrite
  of the existing helper.
- **Lifted to:** TACTICS-GOLF § 3 *Search mathlib before mirroring*
  (the "spanning set ⇒ orthogonal-complement-trivial" bullet) —
  general rule is *reach for `Submodule.isOrtho_span` before
  `span_induction`*.

### ~~[open] No upstream "generic point off a line in `ℝ²`" helper~~

- **Where it bit:** `exists_off_line_off_finite_dim_two`
  (`HennebergRigidity.lean:195`).
- **Resolution:** mirrored as `AffineSubspace.biUnion_ne_univ_of_top_notMem`.
  See [Mirrored](#mirrored) for the full entry. The sibling
  `exists_typeII_q_on_line_dim_two` (Type II shape) is **not** covered
  by this approach — placing `q` *on* the line is a 1-parameter
  excluded-finite-α argument, naturally `Set.Finite.exists_notMem` in
  `ℝ`, not an affine-cover application — and stays project-internal.

### ~~[open] No `LinearIndepOn` "row-restriction transports LI through dual" helper~~

Resolved by mirroring `LinearIndependent.dualMap_of_surjective` /
`LinearIndepOn.dualMap_of_surjective` — see the corresponding entry in
[Mirrored](#mirrored) below.

### [open] "Open + generic via continuous perturbation" pattern recurs across non-collinear / affinely-spanning placements

- **Where it bit:** Two existing callers materialize the same skeleton
  independently:
  - `SimpleGraph.exists_affinelySpanning_of_eventually`
    (`RigidityMatroid.lean:442`) — perturbs `p₀` along a moment curve
    `w v = (φ(v)^1, …, φ(v)^d)`, openness premise `∀ᶠ p in 𝓝 p₀, P p`,
    generic conclusion *affinely-spanning* discharged via finite
    polynomial bad-set. Used at `P = IsInfinitesimallyRigid` (Phase 6,
    `LamanTheorem.lean`) and `P = EdgeSetRowIndependent · I` in dim 2
    (Phase 7, `MatroidIdentification.lean`).
  - `Henneberg.exists_nonCollinear_update_perturbation_dim_two`
    (`HennebergRigidity.lean:507`) — perturbs `p₀ c` via
    `Function.update p₀ c (p₀ c + t • w)`, openness premise
    `∀ᶠ t in 𝓝 (0 : ℝ), P (Function.update p₀ c (p₀ c + t • w))`,
    generic conclusion *non-collinear LI*. Used at
    `P = G.IsInfinitesimallyRigid · ∧ Function.Injective ·`
    (`exists_nonCollinear_rigid_placement_dim_two`) and
    `P = G'.EdgeSetRowIndependent · Set.univ`
    (`exists_nonCollinear_rowIndependent_placement_dim_two`).
- **Friction:** both helpers roll their own filter combine + witness
  extraction (`hP_ev.filter_mono nhdsWithin_le_nhds` + the generic
  side, `.and`, `.exists`). The bookkeeping is ~6 lines per caller and
  the structure is identical: pull `hP` back to `𝓝 0` via continuity
  of the perturbation (or accept it directly in `𝓝 0`-on-`t` form),
  conjoin with `hQ` on `𝓝[≠] 0`, extract a `t` via `NeBot`.
- **Proposed fix:** mirror a shared
  `Filter.Eventually.exists_with_continuous_perturbation` (working
  name) under `CombinatorialRigidity/Mathlib/Topology/...`, signature
  roughly
  ```
  {α : Type*} [TopologicalSpace α] {p₀ : α} {P Q : α → Prop}
  (hP : ∀ᶠ p in 𝓝 p₀, P p)
  (perturb : ℝ → α) (h_cont : ContinuousAt perturb 0) (h_zero : perturb 0 = p₀)
  (hQ : ∀ᶠ t in 𝓝[≠] (0 : ℝ), Q (perturb t)) :
  ∃ p, P p ∧ Q p
  ```
  C10's helper would replace its 6-line endgame
  (`filter_upwards [hP_ev.filter_mono ...] with t hP_t ht_ne; ...` +
  `.exists`) with one call.
  `exists_affinelySpanning_of_eventually` would need its endgame
  rewritten from the explicit `Metric.eventually_nhds_iff` + finite
  bad-set + `Set.Infinite.Ioo.diff` form to a `𝓝[≠] 0` filter form (a
  finite bad set is `eventually` in `𝓝[≠] 0` by cofiniteness), then
  consume the shared lemma. Some C10 callers may also want a
  `∀ᶠ p in 𝓝 p₀`-on-`p` variant that absorbs the continuity pullback
  internally (cleaner for #9; useless for #11 since the injectivity
  half is inherently `Function.update`-shaped).
- **Status:** open. **Priority: low; defer until a third caller
  appears.** Two callers is on the bubble — net LoC saving is ~5-10
  across the two existing sites and requires non-trivial churn in
  `exists_affinelySpanning_of_eventually`'s metric-style endgame.
  Phase 8 (or a dim-`d > 2` Henneberg generalization) is the natural
  third-caller trigger; the pattern lives in
  [`notes/Phase7-cleanup.md` C10] in the meantime.

### [open] `Function.Injective.option_elim` would clean up Henneberg-move injectivity

- **Where it bit:** `injective_option_elim` (`HennebergRigidity.lean:61`,
  private, ~5 lines). Used in `typeI_isGenericallyRigidInj_two` and
  `typeII_isGenericallyRigidInj_two_of_nonCollinear`. The "4-way
  rintro" shape recurs whenever a Henneberg iso constructor pairs
  an injective old placement with a fresh `q ∉ Set.range`.
- **Friction:** trivial proof, but project-internal and unnamed.
- **Proposed fix:** mirror `Function.Injective.option_elim` under
  `CombinatorialRigidity/Mathlib/Data/Option/Basic.lean`. Statement:
  `{f : α → β} (hf : Function.Injective f) {b : β} (hb : b ∉ Set.range f) :
  Function.Injective (fun o : Option α => o.elim b f)`.
- **Status:** open. **Priority: low**. Cosmetic — only mirror when
  there's a third caller.

### [resolved] Sym2-symmetry case split in `typeII_isInfinitesimallyRigid_extend` understated by blueprint

- **Where it bit:** `typeII_isInfinitesimallyRigid_extend`
  (`HennebergRigidity.lean`). The blueprint prose calls the
  deleted-edge recovery "subtract the second from the first";
  the Lean originally handled a `Sym2.eq_iff` case split on
  `s(u, v) = s(a, b)` *both ways*, and explicitly avoided
  `rcases ⟨rfl, rfl⟩` because the `subst` would eliminate `a`/`b`
  from the context.
- **Friction:** prose-to-Lean gap. The case split + `subst`
  avoidance isn't substantive math but is substantive Lean
  infrastructure.
- **Resolution:** the case split was unnecessary — `RigidityMap` is
  defined via `Sym2.lift` (`Framework.lean`), so Sym2-symmetry is
  baked in at the edge-subtype level. Rewriting
  `⟨s(u, v), he⟩ = ⟨s(a, b), h_eq ▸ he⟩` via `Subtype.ext h_eq` *before*
  unfolding the rigidity-map application lets the deleted-edge branch
  close in three lines (rewrite, `simp [rigidityMap_apply, …]`,
  `exact h_deleted`) rather than nine. No mirror needed; no blueprint
  prose change needed (the blueprint's "subtract the second from the
  first" reading is accurate — the orientation case split was a
  Lean-side artefact of un-lifting too early).
- **Lesson:** when a function is built via `Sym2.lift`, push
  `Sym2 V`-equalities through the subtype layer (`Subtype.ext`) rather
  than `Sym2.eq_iff`-case-splitting after unfolding. The orientation
  symmetry is encoded in the lift's symmetry proof — recovering it
  manually in the unfolded inner-product form duplicates work.
- **Status:** resolved (2026-05-15).
- **Lifted to:** TACTICS-GOLF § 5 *Lifting Subtype-Sym2 equalities*,
  subsection "Pattern (the other direction): `Sym2 V` equality →
  `G.edgeSet` subtype equality".

### [resolved] "Test motion `x_α`" gadget in Phase 7 understated by blueprint prose

- **Where it bit:** `typeI_edgeSetRowIndependent_extend`
  (`MatroidIdentification.lean`). The blueprint prose for new-row LI
  and old-vs-new disjointness invoked "the same trick" — but the Lean
  expanded "the trick" into a `set x_α := fun w => w.elim α 0`
  binding plus a 12-line `Submodule.span_le` / `LinearMap.mem_ker`
  argument that the old-row span vanishes at `x_α`. The private
  helper `typeI_new_rows_coeff_zero` packages the
  coefficient-extraction.
- **Friction:** prose-to-Lean gap; the test-motion gadget is a
  substantive construction that should appear in the blueprint
  prose as a named gadget, not as "the same trick".
- **Resolution:** two-pronged.
  - **Lean (12 lines → 9):** consolidated the `Submodule.span_le`
    block by folding `SetLike.mem_coe` + `LinearMap.mem_ker` +
    `Module.Dual.eval_apply` into a single `simp` set and tightening
    the destructure (`rintro _ ⟨e, ⟨⟨e0, he0⟩, rfl⟩, rfl⟩` skips the
    intermediate `obtain` of the old `g`-binding). The trailing
    `have := h_le hf_old; rwa [...]` collapses to `simpa using h_le
    hf_old`. Cosmetic-ish but the proof now fits on screen as a
    single visual unit.
  - **Blueprint:** named the gadget as a parametric **test motion**
    $x_\alpha$ with $x_\alpha(\mathrm{none}) = \alpha$ and
    $x_\alpha \circ \mathrm{some} = 0$; restructured the proof
    sketch around it so both the new-row LI and the disjointness
    claim cite the same construction explicitly, rather than
    invoking "the same trick".
- **Lesson:** the "span vanishes if generators vanish" pattern has no
  packaged mathlib lemma — `Submodule.span_le` + a kernel-of-`Module.
  Dual.eval` framing is the idiomatic chain. The friction was less
  about Lean depth and more about *naming* the gadget so the
  blueprint matches the structure of the formal proof.
- **Status:** resolved (2026-05-15).

### [resolved] `elemSkewMap_ofLp_inr_apply` proof collapse via wider simp + grind

- **Where it bit:** `trivialMotionFamily_linearIndependent`
  (`TrivialMotions.lean`). The `elemSkewMap_ofLp_inr_apply`
  helper unpacked a `Eᵢⱼ - Eⱼᵢ`-style entry into specific coordinate
  cases, closed by `grind`.
- **Friction:** the original proof ran `change` (to unfold `⟨a, b⟩.fst`
  and `.ofLp i`) → `rw [elemSkewMap_apply]` → `simp only [...]` →
  `rcases ... <;> split_ifs <;> grind`. Six tactic lines for what's
  ultimately one case analysis.
- **Resolution:** stripped to `rcases eq_or_ne i a with rfl | hia <;>
  simp [elemSkewMap_apply] <;> grind`. The `simp [elemSkewMap_apply]`
  (rather than `simp only [...]`) lets the default simp set drop
  `⟨a, b⟩.fst` / `.ofLp i` / `PiLp.single` boilerplate that previously
  needed manual rewrites, and `grind` absorbs the `split_ifs` step.
  Net 6 tactic lines → 1. Tried the `Matrix.stdBasisMatrix`-difference
  framing as the friction entry proposed; not a clean simplification
  (would require an `elemSkewMap = Matrix.toEuclideanLin (E_{ij} -
  E_{ji})` rewrite, which adds `WithLp` / `toLin` bridge overhead and
  changes the rest of the API).
- **Lesson:** when a proof leans on `change` + multi-step `rw` to set
  up a tightly-shaped goal for `grind`, try a wider `simp` (default
  set, not `simp only [...]`) first — the default simp set often
  absorbs the same boilerplate without the explicit bookkeeping. The
  `split_ifs` step is also usually redundant when `grind` follows.
- **Status:** resolved (2026-05-15).
- **Lifted to:** TACTICS-GOLF § 1 *Tricks we've found useful* →
  "Default `simp` before `grind` can subsume `change` + multi-`rw`
  staging".

### [resolved] Extending a function on a subtype to the parent type — `dite` vs `Function.extend`

- **Where it bit:** `linearRigidityRow` (`LinearRigidityMatroid.lean`),
  Phase 8 scaffolding. Needed a function
  `Sym2 V → Module.Dual ℝ (Framework V d)` extending
  `(⊤ : SimpleGraph V).rigidityRow p : (⊤).edgeSet → Module.Dual …`
  by zero off the edge set, to feed `Matroid.ofFun`.
- **Friction:** the dependent `if h : e ∈ (⊤).edgeSet then …⟨e, h⟩ else
  0` shape required `Decidable (e ∈ (⊤ : SimpleGraph V).edgeSet)`,
  which isn't synthesisable for an arbitrary `Set` membership without
  pulling in `Classical` (or a per-graph decidability instance the
  call site can't supply).
- **Resolution:** switched to
  `Function.extend Subtype.val ((⊤).rigidityRow p) 0`. Both the on-set
  characterisation (`linearRigidityRow_subtype_val`) and the
  membership-form (`linearRigidityRow_of_mem`) close in one line via
  `Subtype.val_injective.extend_apply`. No `Decidable` instance
  needed; the def stays `noncomputable` either way.
- **Lesson:** for "extend a function on a subtype to the parent type
  by a constant", prefer `Function.extend (Subtype.val) f c` over
  `dite (· ∈ S) (fun h ↦ f ⟨·, h⟩) (fun _ ↦ c)`. The `dite` form
  forces a `Decidable` instance that's typically classical-only for
  `Set`s; the `Function.extend` form uses
  `Function.Injective.extend_apply` for clean rewriting.
- **Status:** resolved (2026-05-16).

### [resolved] `[LinearOrder V]`-only lemma signature mismatches a caller's explicit `[DecidableEq V]` instance

- **Where it bit:** `edgeListSorted_map_sym2_toFinset` in
  `PebbleGame/Exec.lean` (Phase 10 Layer 2). The discharge's signature
  declared `[LinearOrder V]` only; its return type
  `(_.map _).toFinset = G.edgeFinset` elaborates with
  `Sym2.instDecidableEq V (fun a b ↦ LinearOrder.toDecidableEq a b)`
  (the auto-derived `DecidableEq` from `LinearOrder`). The caller
  `runPebbleGameExec_correct` runs inside a section variable
  `[DecidableEq V]` (`inst✝³`); the workhorse it composes with
  (`runPebbleGameWith_correct`) expects
  `Sym2.instDecidableEq V inst✝³`. Lean's defeq check refused
  to unify `LinearOrder.toDecidableEq` with `inst✝³` despite both
  proving the same proposition, surfacing as *"Application type
  mismatch"* on the discharge argument.
- **Friction:** the lemma is short; the fix is a one-character signature
  change. But the error message points at the discharge's full
  elaborated type vs. the workhorse's elaborated expectation, and the
  divergence happens inside `Sym2.instDecidableEq`'s first explicit
  arg — easy to misread as a `Sym2`-level instance problem when it's
  really a `V`-level one.
- **Resolution:** declared `[DecidableEq V] [LinearOrder V]` (in that
  order) on the discharge. Lean then uses the explicit `[DecidableEq V]`
  parameter inside the discharge's body, the caller passes its section
  `[DecidableEq V]`, and the workhorse's expected `inst✝³` unifies
  cleanly.
- **Lesson:** when a lemma's return type involves a `DecidableEq`-
  dependent operation (`List.toFinset`, `Finset.image`, `Finset.filter`,
  etc.) and the lemma is called from a context with an explicit
  `[DecidableEq V]` *separate from* its `[LinearOrder V]`, declare
  `[DecidableEq V]` explicitly on the lemma too. Otherwise the
  auto-derived `LinearOrder.toDecidableEq` becomes the lemma's
  canonical instance choice, and cross-section unification fails.
  Different manifestation of the same family as
  `TACTICS-QUIRKS § 22` (`LinearOrder.lift'` on `SetLike` types
  silently breaking `Decidable (· ≤ ·)`), but the *direction* of
  the conflict is reversed: § 22 is about a missing `Decidable` after
  a `lift'`; this is about a mismatch between two valid `DecidableEq`
  proofs.
- **Status:** resolved (2026-05-18).

## Anti-patterns / known dead ends

Tried-and-rejected approaches, deprecated patterns, and tactic
limitations. Worth a once-over so future agents don't re-litigate.

### [wontfix] `omega` doesn't see through nonlinear algebra on opaque atoms
- **Where it bit:**
  - `IsGenericallyRigid.card_mul_le` in `Framework.lean` —
    *commutativity*. `Framework.finrank = Fintype.card V * d`; the
    lemma uses `d * Fintype.card V`. omega treats both as different
    atoms.
  - `IsTightOn.union_inter` in `Sparsity.lean` — *distributivity*.
    omega has `(s ∪ t).card + (s ∩ t).card = s.card + t.card`
    (`Finset.card_union_add_card_inter`) but needs
    `k * #s + k * #t = k * #(s ∪ t) + k * #(s ∩ t)`; the atoms
    `k * #s`, `k * #t`, `k * #(s ∪ t)`, `k * #(s ∩ t)` are unrelated to
    omega without an explicit distributivity step.
- **Proposed fix:** none upstream — this is omega's intended design
  (atomic variables don't carry commutativity or distributivity).
  Workaround: pre-normalize via `rw`/`mul_comm` so the form omega sees
  matches the goal. For *commutativity*, `IsGenericallyRigid.card_mul_le`
  restated `h_total` as `Module.finrank ℝ (Framework V d) = d *
  Fintype.card V` via `rw [Framework.finrank, mul_comm]`. For
  *distributivity*, `IsTightOn.union_inter` stages a `have h_card_mul`
  via the 3-rewrite chain `rw [← Nat.mul_add, ← Nat.mul_add,
  Finset.card_union_add_card_inter]` then hands the multiplied identity
  to omega alongside the unmultiplied facts. `linear_combination k * h.symm`
  is a one-liner alternative but requires `Mathlib.Tactic.LinearCombination`
  which Sparsity does not currently import.
- **Status:** wontfix (intrinsic to omega).
- **Lifted to:** TACTICS-QUIRKS § 2 *`omega` doesn't carry
  commutativity or distributivity on atoms*.

### [wontfix] `omega` treats `set`-aliased terms as opaque atoms
- **Where it bit:** `IsSparse.typeII_reverse_blocker` in `Sparsity.lean`
  (originally the Laman shell `IsLaman.typeII_reverse_blocker` in
  `Henneberg.lean`, Phase 5 milestone 1; the friction was retained when
  Phase 7 lifted the core to `IsSparse`).
- **Friction:** the proof opens `set bridge := s(xs, ys)` and then
  defines `h_diff : (G'.edgeSet \ {bridge}).ncard + 1 = G'.edgeSet.ncard`
  from `Set.ncard_diff_singleton_add_one hbridge_in_G'`. Separately,
  `typeII_edgeSet_ncard` produces `h_typeII_count` mentioning
  `(G'.edgeSet \ {s(xs, ys)}).ncard` (the upstream lemma doesn't know
  about the alias). The two `ncard` terms are *definitionally* equal,
  but `omega` sees them as distinct atoms and can't bridge `h_diff`
  with `h_typeII_count` to derive `G'.edgeSet.ncard + 3 = …`.
- **Proposed fix:** none upstream. Workaround: explicit
  `rw [← hbridge_def] at h_typeII_count` (or `rw [hbridge_def] at
  h_diff`) to fold the literal expression back into the alias before
  invoking omega. The fix is one line once the cause is understood.
  Same pattern applies to `grind` and any tactic that uses syntactic
  atoms — it's a general consequence of `set name := expr` introducing
  a fresh local constant without globally substituting `expr` in
  hypotheses produced by *later* tactic calls.
- **Status:** wontfix (intrinsic to omega/grind's atomic-variable
  model; the `set` tactic's substitution scope is bounded by current
  goals and hypotheses, not future ones).
- **Lifted to:** TACTICS-QUIRKS § 1 *`omega`/`grind` treat
  `set`-aliased terms as opaque atoms*.

### [wontfix] `nlinarith` over ℕ struggles with quadratic bounds
- **Where it bit:** `top_fin_two_isGenericallyRigid` in `Framework.lean`,
  closing the arithmetic step `4 * d + 2 ≤ (d + 1) * (d + 2)` (over ℕ).
- **Friction:** `nlinarith` over ℕ doesn't reliably close this from
  scratch. Mathematically the bound rearranges to `d ≤ d * d` which is
  `0 ≤ d² - d = d(d-1)`, trivial over ℝ/ℤ via `sq_nonneg (d - 1)`, but
  ℕ-subtraction truncates and `nlinarith` can't recover the squaring.
  Workaround: expand `(d+1)*(d+2) = d*d + 3*d + 2` via `ring` (as a
  `have`), surface `d ≤ d*d` via `Nat.le_mul_self d`, then close with
  `omega`.
- **Proposed fix:** none upstream. The pattern is general: any
  ℕ-quadratic bound where one side has `d * d` and the other is linear
  in `d` benefits from `Nat.le_mul_self` as the bridge. Documented here
  so future agents reach for it directly instead of iterating
  `nlinarith` hint lists.
- **Status:** wontfix (intrinsic to `nlinarith`-on-ℕ; workaround is a
  one-liner once you know the trick).
- **Lifted to:** TACTICS-QUIRKS § 3 *`nlinarith` over ℕ on
  quadratic bounds: `Nat.le_mul_self`*.

### [wontfix] `revert` ordering before `e'.ind` is finicky
- **Where it bit:** `typeI_edgeSet` proof, backward direction.
- **Friction:** To do Sym2 induction on a hypothesis `e'` while
  preserving other hypotheses depending on `e'` (here: `heG : e' ∈ S`
  and `hmap : Sym2.map some e' = s(x, y)`), we `revert` the dependent
  hypotheses first. The order of revert determines the order of
  hypotheses in the lambda after `refine e'.ind fun p q ... => ?_`. The
  correct rule is **revert in reverse order of the lambda binders**:
  for lambda `fun p q heG hne hmap`, revert `hmap hne heG`. Forgetting
  this gave a confusing "rewrite failed" error in `typeII` because
  `hmap` ended up bound to a different hypothesis.
- **Proposed fix:** none needed; this is intrinsic to `revert`/`refine`
  semantics. Documented here so the next agent doesn't redo the trial
  and error. Alternative: use `induction e' with | h p q => …` which
  generalizes context automatically.
- **Status:** wontfix (tactic-semantics issue, not a missing lemma).

### [wontfix] `simp` leaves and-grouping in `typeII` `edgesIn` decomposition
- **Where it bit:** `typeII_isLaman` sparsity, `h_decomp` proof.
- **Friction:** the `s(some u, some v)` branch of the Sym2 case-split
  reduces under `simp [edgesIn, hcoe, Set.mem_preimage, T']` to
  `(G.Adj u v ∧ p) ∧ q ↔ (G.Adj u v ∧ q) ∧ p` for the same conjuncts
  `p, q` — `simp` does not re-associate `∧`. The matching `typeI`
  proof closes on bare `simp` because the `Adj` predicate there has
  no extra `s(u, v) ≠ s(a, b)` conjunct. Adding `; try tauto` after
  the simp closes the typeII case in one extra line per branch.
- **Proposed fix:** none upstream-able; this is just `simp` not
  doing classical AC. Documented so the next agent doesn't churn
  on the `simp` set when it inevitably "almost" works. **Tried
  later:** adding `and_assoc, and_left_comm` to the simp set does
  *not* work — they reorder past the `Sym2.map ... = s(some u, some v)`
  conjunct, breaking the `Sym2.exists_and_map_eq_mk_iff` simp pattern,
  so the `(some, some)` case fails to close even with the trailing
  `try tauto`. Stay with the `try tauto` workaround.
- **Status:** wontfix (tactic limitation, not a missing lemma).

### [wontfix] `push_neg` deprecated in favour of `push Not`
- **Where it bit:** `IsLaman.exists_degree_le_three`.
- **Friction:** `push_neg` triggers a deprecation warning. The
  replacement `push Not at hcontra` works but produces `3 < x` rather
  than `4 ≤ x`; an extra `omega` (or `Nat.add_one_le_iff`) is needed
  even though the two forms are defeq in `ℕ`.
- **Proposed fix:** none required from us; this is an upstream
  ergonomics issue. Documented here so future agents know not to
  re-litigate it.
- **Status:** wontfix (upstream concern).

### [resolved] `lake build` of Phase 5 files is import-floor-bound and timing-noisy
- **Where it bit:** Performance audit in Phase 5's third cleanup pass.
- **Friction:** `Framework.lean`, `HennebergRigidity.lean`, and
  `Laman.lean` each take 20–40 s for a from-scratch `lake build`, but
  `lake env lean` on a stub file with just `Framework.lean`'s imports
  is already ~27 s — so most of the wall-clock is import loading, not
  within-file elaboration (Framework's own work is ~6 s, HR's ~19 s,
  Laman's ~11 s). The within-file portion is *itself* highly variable
  (10–50 s for the same source, depending on lake/OS caches). A/B
  comparing optimization candidates needs many runs per side and still
  often returns ambiguous results.
- **Resolution:** The post-Phase-8 perf pass (F3.2–F3.6, see
  `notes/Phase8-perf.md`) executed structural lever (a) — convert
  the project + its `Mathlib/…` mirrors to Lean's `module` + `public
  import` system, plus narrow the exposure surface to `public section`
  with selective `@[expose]`. The 4-run A/B vs F1.1 baseline shows
  `HennebergRigidity` 57.3 → 20.8 s (−36.5 s), `RigidityMatroid`
  53.7 → 22.7 s (−31.0 s), `LinearRigidityMatroid` 62.3 → 16.8 s
  (−45.5 s), project-total 21.2 → 9.2 s (−12.0 s); each Δ is 2–9×
  the ±5 s noise band threshold. The project's largest measured
  perf win; promoted to `PERFORMANCE.md` *Experiments that did pay*.
  Lever (b) (a `Framework.lean` facade) is no longer needed — F3.6
  showed the file-level module + narrowed-exposure axis is sufficient
  to drop the analysis floor.
- **Status:** resolved (post-Phase-8 perf pass).

## Mirrored

### [mirrored] `Matrix.linearIndependent_rows_iff_det_mul_transpose_ne_zero` + `finite_setOf_not_linearIndependent_rows_along_affine_path` (rectangular Gram det + polynomial-along-line)
- **Where it bit:** Phase 8 target `linearRigidityMatroid_eq_rigidityMatroid`
  in `LinearRigidityMatroid.lean`, the inductive proof of
  `exists_uniform_rowIndependent_placement_dim_two`. The blueprint sketch
  (`lem:exists-uniform-rowIndependent-placement`) is linear-interpolation
  perturbation over the finite family of `(2, 3)`-sparse subsets: along
  `p_t := (1 − t) • p₀ + t • q`, each "row-LI on `S` at `p_t`" is the
  non-vanishing of a polynomial in `t` (the rigidity rows are affine in
  `t`, the LI/non-LI condition is a polynomial via a Gram-det), nonzero
  at `t = 0` (IH subfamily) or `t = 1` (new subset), so cofinitely many
  `t` work.
- **Friction:** mathlib's `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/NonsingularInverse`
  carries `Matrix.linearIndependent_rows_iff_isUnit` for **square** matrices
  (rows LI ↔ unit ↔ det ≠ 0 over a field). The rectangular analogue —
  "rows of `A : Matrix m n R` LI ↔ `(A * Aᵀ).det ≠ 0`" — is a direct
  consequence of `Matrix.rank_self_mul_transpose` /
  `Matrix.rank_eq_finrank_span_row` / `LinearIndependent.rank_matrix`
  in `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean`, but is not packaged as an
  iff lemma. The polynomial-along-line corollary (cofiniteness of the
  bad-`t` set for affine `A + t • B` when LI holds at some `t₀`) similarly
  isn't packaged.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as
  - `Matrix.linearIndependent_rows_iff_rank_eq_card` (iff form of
    `LinearIndependent.rank_matrix`, over any field): rows LI ↔
    `A.rank = Fintype.card m`.
  - `Matrix.linearIndependent_rows_iff_det_mul_transpose_ne_zero` (over
    `LinearOrderedField` so `rank_self_mul_transpose` applies): rows
    LI ↔ `(A * Aᵀ).det ≠ 0`.
  - `Matrix.finite_setOf_not_linearIndependent_rows_along_affine_path`
    (ℝ-specific): for `A B : Matrix m n ℝ` and `t₀ : ℝ`, LI of rows at
    `A + t₀ • B` implies the bad-`t` set has finite complement. Proof
    routes through the polynomial-entry matrix `P := X • C(B) + C(A)`
    plus `Q := det(P * Pᵀ)`: `Q.eval t = det((A + t • B) * (A + t • B)ᵀ)`
    via `(evalRingHom t).map_det` + `Matrix.map_mul` + `Matrix.transpose_map`;
    `Q ≠ 0` by hypothesis at `t₀`; bad-`t` set ⊆ root set, finite by
    `Polynomial.finite_setOf_isRoot`.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean`. Sits naturally
  alongside `Matrix.rank_self_mul_transpose` and `LinearIndependent.rank_matrix`.

### [mirrored] `Matrix.linearIndependent_rows_of_specialized_submatrix_det_ne_zero` (minor-nonvanishing reflection over a domain)
- **Where it bit:** Phase 14 reverse half (`lem:k-frame-specialize-forest`),
  the minor-nonvanishing step: from a full-rank block-diagonal forest-packing
  specialization, conclude that the generic `k`-frame rows are linearly
  independent over the polynomial ring `R = MvPolynomial (β × Fin k) ℚ`.
- **Friction:** the naive "images under `φ : R →+* S` are LI ⟹ originals are LI"
  coefficient-wise reflection is **false** when `φ` has a nontrivial kernel (a
  dependence `∑ cᵢ vᵢ = 0` maps to `∑ φ(cᵢ)(φ∘vᵢ) = 0`; `φ∘v` LI gives only
  `φ(cᵢ) = 0`, not `cᵢ = 0`). The correct argument must route through a maximal
  minor's determinant, and mathlib has only the *square* `det ≠ 0 ⟹ rows LI`
  (`Matrix.linearIndependent_rows_of_det_ne_zero`), not the
  rectangular-with-specialization form.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as
  `Matrix.linearIndependent_rows_of_specialized_submatrix_det_ne_zero`: for
  `M : ι → κ → R` over a domain `R` (`ι` finite), a column selection `e : ι → κ`,
  and `φ : R →+* S` into a nontrivial `S`, if `φ (submatrix (M ∘ e)).det ≠ 0`
  then `LinearIndependent R M`. The specialized det being nonzero forces the
  `R`-det nonzero (`φ 0 = 0`), so the chosen square submatrix has LI rows; the
  full rows follow by `LinearIndependent.of_comp` with the column-projection
  `LinearMap.pi (fun i ↦ LinearMap.proj (e i)) : (κ → R) →ₗ[R] (ι → R)`.
- **General lesson (avoid the false reflection):** *"the images under a ring
  hom are LI" does not imply "the originals are LI" unless the hom is injective;
  reflect linear independence through a square minor's determinant, never
  coefficient-wise.* Not lifted to TACTICS-GOLF — it is a mathematical caveat
  captured fully in this lemma's doc-comment + the Phase 14 notes, not a
  recurring tactic pattern.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean`. Companion to the
  rectangular-LI entry above; promotes alongside
  `Matrix.linearIndependent_rows_of_det_ne_zero` in `Determinant/Basic`.

### [mirrored] `Matrix.exists_submatrix_det_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_rows` (full row rank ⟹ nonsingular maximal minor)
- **Where it bit:** Phase 14 reverse half (`lem:k-frame-specialize-forest`), the
  wiring step that feeds the minor-nonvanishing engine above: to apply it one
  must *produce* the square column selection `e : ι → κ`, and the specialized
  block-diagonal forest matrix is only known to have LI rows.
- **Friction:** mathlib has the *square* `linearIndependent_rows_iff_isUnit`
  (rows LI ⟺ matrix a unit) but no rectangular "rows LI ⟹ there is a column
  selection making a nonzero square minor" — i.e. the classical "row rank =
  column rank, so a maximal independent set of columns is nonsingular".
- **Resolution:** mirrored as
  `Matrix.exists_submatrix_det_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_rows`: for
  `M : Matrix m n K` over a field with `m` finite, `LinearIndependent K M.row`
  yields `e : m → n` with `(of (fun i j ↦ M i (e j))).det ≠ 0`. The columns
  (= rows of `Mᵀ`) span `m → K` (`LinearIndependent.rank_matrix` + `rank_transpose`
  + `Submodule.eq_top_of_finrank_eq`); `exists_linearIndependent'` extracts a
  spanning LI subfamily, which `Basis.mk` turns into a basis of cardinality `#m`
  (so its index `≃ m`), and the reindexed columns are the transpose of the
  nonsingular minor (`linearIndependent_rows_iff_isUnit` + `isUnit_iff_isUnit_det`
  + `det_transpose`).
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean`. Companion to the two
  rectangular-LI entries above; the natural "existence" partner of
  `LinearIndependent.rank_matrix`.

### [mirrored] `Finset.mul_card_union_add_mul_card_inter` (`k`-scaled `card_union_add_card_inter`)
- **Where it bit:** the union-half of `IsTightOn.union_inter`
  (`Sparsity.lean`:432) and step 2 of `IsTightOn.union_with_bonus`
  (`Sparsity.lean`:478). Both `IsTightOn`-accounting lemmas needed the
  numeric identity `k * |s| + k * |t| = k * |s ∪ t| + k * |s ∩ t|`,
  and both wrote the same 3-rewrite chain
  `rw [← Nat.mul_add, ← Nat.mul_add, Finset.card_union_add_card_inter]`
  to discharge it. Surfaced by the Phase 7 cleanup-round B7 audit.
- **Friction:** mathlib's `Finset.card_union_add_card_inter` gives the
  un-scaled identity `(s ∪ t).card + (s ∩ t).card = s.card + t.card`;
  scaling by a fixed `k` requires two `← Nat.mul_add` rewrites first.
  `omega` doesn't help (the `k *` factor is an opaque atom);
  `linarith` similarly can't multiply hypotheses by a symbolic
  constant. The 3-rewrite chain *is* the lemma.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as
  `Finset.mul_card_union_add_mul_card_inter (s t : Finset α) (k : ℕ) :
    k * s.card + k * t.card = k * (s ∪ t).card + k * (s ∩ t).card`.
  Both call sites collapse to a one-line `have h_card_mul :=
  Finset.mul_card_union_add_mul_card_inter s t k`.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Finset/Card.lean`. Sits naturally
  alongside `Finset.card_union_add_card_inter`.

### [mirrored] `Function.Injective.eventually_of_continuousAt` and `eventually_update_of_continuousAt` (openness of injectivity)
- **Where it bit:** `exists_nonCollinear_rigid_placement_dim_two`
  (`HennebergRigidity.lean`, the perpendicular-perturbation helper underneath
  `typeII_isGenericallyRigidInj_two`). The blueprint runs ~15 lines of prose;
  the Lean expanded to ~107 lines. The bulk of the gap was a hand-rolled
  "injectivity is eventually preserved" `∀ᶠ`-argument via
  `Finset.eventually_all` + componentwise `ContinuousAt.eventually_ne`, taking
  ~25 lines. (Originally noted that "Phase 7's Type II row-LI lift will need
  the same shape" — that prediction was wrong: the matroid hard direction does
  not require an *injective* placement, so the row-LI Type II lift's
  perpendicular-perturbation step uses
  `EdgeSetRowIndependent.eventually` — openness of *row-LI*, not of
  injectivity — instead. Meta-pattern is the same, closing lemma is different.)
- **Friction:** mathlib has `Set.InjOn.exists_mem_nhdsSet` (in
  `Mathlib/Topology/Separation/Hausdorff.lean`) — compactness + neighborhood-of-
  a-set form — but no "componentwise-continuous finite-domain family,
  injective at a point, is eventually injective" form. Each Henneberg-rigidity
  move that goes through a perturbation had to re-prove this in place.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as
  - `Function.Injective.eventually_of_continuousAt`: for
    `[Finite V]`, `[T2Space α]`, a family `F : X → V → α` componentwise
    `ContinuousAt` at `x₀` with `Injective (F x₀)` is eventually injective in
    `𝓝 x₀`. Each `(u, v)` with `u ≠ v` contributes a
    `ContinuousAt.prodMk`-driven eventuality that `(F x u, F x v)` stays off
    the diagonal (closed in `α × α` by Hausdorffness); `Finset.eventually_all`
    aggregates.
  - `Function.Injective.eventually_update_of_continuousAt`: corollary for
    `update p₀ c (f x)` with `f x₀ = p₀ c` and `ContinuousAt f x₀`. The
    one-vertex perturbation shape that arises in Henneberg generic-placement
    arguments collapses to one term-mode call.

  The `h_inj_ev` block in `exists_nonCollinear_rigid_placement_dim_two` is now
  a four-line term-mode application of `eventually_update_of_continuousAt`
  (down from ~30 lines).
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Topology/Separation/Hausdorff.lean`. Sits naturally
  alongside `Set.InjOn.exists_mem_nhdsSet` as a dual ("evaluate a parametric
  family at finitely many points" vs. "InjOn on a compact set") perspective on
  openness-of-injectivity.

### [mirrored] `AffineSubspace.biUnion_ne_univ_of_top_notMem` + `affineSpan_ne_top_of_ncard_le_finrank` (affine analogue of `Subspace.biUnion_ne_univ_of_top_notMem` plus a cardinality side-condition)
- **Where it bit:** `exists_off_line_off_finite_dim_two`
  (`HennebergRigidity.lean`, used by Phase 5 `typeI_isGenericallyRigidInj_two`
  and Phase 7 `typeI_edgeSetRowIndependent_lift`). The prose claim "pick a
  point off the line through `pa, pb` and off a finite avoid-set `S`" is one
  geometric step (over an infinite field, a proper line ∪ finitely many
  points doesn't cover the plane). The Lean wrapper expanded to a 35-line
  `pa + t • v` parametric construction with a
  `LinearIndependent.pair_add_smul_add_smul_iff` row-op and a
  `Set.Finite`-bad-set selection.
- **Friction:** mathlib has the linear-subspace cover theorem
  `Subspace.biUnion_ne_univ_of_top_notMem` (in `Mathlib/GroupTheory/CosetCover`)
  — over an infinite division ring, a vector space is not a finite union
  of proper *linear* subspaces — but no affine analogue. The affine version
  uniformly subsumes "proper subspace + finitely many points" as a single
  cover (points are 0-dim affine subspaces), which matches the prose
  one-step argument.
- **Resolution:** mirrored two lemmas.
  - `AffineSubspace.biUnion_ne_univ_of_top_notMem`: for `[DivisionRing k]
    [Infinite k] [AddCommGroup V] [Module k V]` and `{s : Finset
    (AffineSubspace k V)}` with `⊤ ∉ s`, `⋃ p ∈ s, (p : Set V) ≠ Set.univ`.
    Proof drops empty affine subspaces, then writes each non-empty `p` as a
    coset `b p +ᵥ p.direction` (basepoint chosen via `choose`), lifting the
    affine cover to an additive-coset cover;
    `AddSubgroup.exists_finiteIndex_of_leftCoset_cover` then produces a
    `p.direction` with finite index, contradicting infinite `V /
    p.direction` (`Module.Free.infinite k` over an infinite division ring
    with `Nontrivial`).
  - `AffineSubspace.affineSpan_ne_top_of_ncard_le_finrank`: for
    `[FiniteDimensional k V] [Nontrivial V]` and `s : Set V` finite with
    `s.ncard ≤ finrank k V`, `affineSpan k s ≠ ⊤`. Subsumes "a single point
    spans no more than itself" and "two points span at most a line" and
    generalizes to triples in dim 3, etc. — the natural ergonomic way to
    discharge the `⊤ ∉ s_cover` side-condition of the cover lemma when the
    cover is built from a small concrete set. Proof routes through
    `finrank_vectorSpan_image_finset_le` after a `Set.ncard ↔ toFinset.card`
    bridge.
- **Consumer side:** `exists_off_line_off_finite_dim_two` builds the cover
  `{affineSpan {pa, pb}} ∪ {affineSpan {s} | s ∈ S}` (line + finite
  singletons, all proper in dim 2), discharges the `⊤ ∉ s_cover`
  side-condition by two calls to `affineSpan_ne_top_of_ncard_le_finrank`
  (one with `Set.ncard_pair`, one with `Set.ncard_singleton`), applies the
  cover lemma, extracts a `q` outside, and converts off-line to `q - pa ∉
  ℝ ∙ (pb - pa)` followed by one `pair_add_smul_add_smul_iff` row-op.
  Parametric `pa + t • v` machinery is gone.
- **Scope note.** The sibling `exists_typeII_q_on_line_dim_two` (place `q`
  *on* the line) does **not** fit this approach — it's a one-parameter
  `Set.Finite.exists_notMem` in `ℝ`, not an affine-cover application — and
  stays as-is.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:**
  `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/AffineSpace/AffineSubspace/Cover.lean`. Parallels
  `Mathlib/GroupTheory/CosetCover.lean` but in the affine-space hierarchy:
  the new file imports `GroupTheory.CosetCover` for the underlying
  `AddSubgroup.exists_finiteIndex_of_leftCoset_cover` machinery and
  `AffineSpace.AffineSubspace.Basic` for the affine API. Putting the affine
  application here (rather than extending CosetCover) respects the
  current import direction (linear-algebra basics → affine-space) and
  keeps CosetCover's scope unchanged. The
  `affineSpan_ne_top_of_ncard_le_finrank` helper would naturally land
  upstream in `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/AffineSpace/FiniteDimensional.lean`
  (alongside `finrank_vectorSpan_image_finset_le`); bundling here keeps
  the project mirror to a single file for now.

### [mirrored] `Set.exists_injective_fin_of_le_ncard` (Fin-indexing of subset elements)
- **Where it bit:** assembly step in `exists_affinelySpanning_rigid_placement`
  (`RigidityMatroid.lean`), the "pick `d + 1` distinct elements of `S` as
  `q : Fin (d + 1) → V`" sub-step; will recur in the upcoming sparsity lemma's
  "pick `d + 1` distinct elements of `s`" steps.
- **Friction:** mathlib's `Set.exists_subset_card_eq` returns a size-`n`
  subset `t ⊆ s` from `n ≤ s.ncard`. Promoting that to "an injective
  `q : Fin n → α` with each `q i ∈ s`" needed `Set.exists_subset_card_eq` →
  `Set.finite_of_ncard_ne_zero` / `Set.Finite.fintype` →
  `Set.ncard_eq_toFinset_card'` / `Set.toFinset_card` →
  `Fintype.equivFinOfCardEq` (~12 lines per call site).
- **Resolution:** mirrored as `Set.exists_injective_fin_of_le_ncard
  {s : Set α} {n : ℕ} (hns : n ≤ s.ncard) : ∃ q : Fin n → α,
  Function.Injective q ∧ ∀ i, q i ∈ s`. The 12-line construction collapses
  to one `obtain`. Internally uses the existing `Set.ncard_eq_card_coe`
  mirror to fold the two-step `ncard ↔ Fintype.card` rewrite to one lemma.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Set/Card.lean`. Sits naturally alongside the
  existing `Set.exists_subset_card_eq`.

### [mirrored] `Polynomial.eval_det_X_add_C` (eval-at-scalar of `det (X • A.map C + B.map C)`)
- **Where it bit:** `exists_affinelySpanning_rigid_placement` in
  `RigidityMatroid.lean`, the `hP_eval` block bridging the polynomial-form
  bad-`t` set `{t | P.IsRoot t}` to the matrix-form bad-`t` set
  `{t | det (t • M₁ + M₀) = 0}`.
- **Friction:** mathlib's `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Polynomial.lean`
  carries `natDegree_det_X_add_C_le`, `coeff_det_X_add_C_zero`, and
  `coeff_det_X_add_C_card` (degree and 0/card coefficients of the
  matrix-polynomial determinant `det (X • A.map C + B.map C) ∈ α[X]`) but no
  companion `eval`-at-scalar identity. The first pass went `RingHom.map_det`
  on `evalRingHom t` + `change` to massage the goal + `congr 1; ext i j` +
  nine-lemma `simp only` (~11 lines).
- **Resolution:** mirrored as
  `Polynomial.eval_det_X_add_C (A B : Matrix n n α) (t : α) :
    eval t (det ((X : α[X]) • A.map C + B.map C)) = (t • A + B).det`.
  Proof: rewrite `eval t = evalRingHom t`, apply `RingHom.map_det`, then
  `congr 1; ext i j; simp only [...]` over a focused set of `coe_evalRingHom`
  / `eval_*` / matrix-coordinate lemmas. `hP_eval` collapses to
  `fun t => by rw [hP_def, Polynomial.eval_det_X_add_C]`.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Polynomial.lean`. Sits
  naturally alongside the existing `coeff_*` and `natDegree_*` siblings.

### [mirrored] `Matrix.det_powerDifferences` (row-0-subtracted Vandermonde minor)
- **Where it bit:** Phase 6 task 4, the `d`-general lift of the
  affinely-spanning rigid placement. The perturbation along the
  moment-curve direction `w(v) = (φ v, (φ v)^2, …, (φ v)^d)` produces a
  perturbed difference matrix `M(t) = M_0 + t · M_1` whose
  `t^d`-coefficient is `det M_1`, where `M_1` is the `d × d` matrix
  with entries `(φ v_i)^(j+1) - (φ v_0)^(j+1)` (`i, j ∈ Fin d`). Showing
  `det M_1 ≠ 0` for injective `φ` is the deep step in turning the bad-`t`
  set into the root set of a degree-`d` polynomial.
- **Friction:** mathlib's `Matrix.det_vandermonde` factors the *full*
  `(d+1) × (d+1)` Vandermonde determinant as the symmetric product of
  differences `∏_{i<j} (v j - v i)`. The factorization of the *row-0-
  subtracted* `d × d` minor is the same product (by row reduction +
  cofactor expansion), but mathlib does not ship this identity directly:
  it's a one-step Laplace expansion away from
  `Matrix.det_eval_matrixOfPolynomials_eq_det_vandermonde` (which sees
  the sparse-row-0 form for free) but not packaged.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as
  - `Matrix.det_powerDifferences`: for `v : Fin (n + 1) → R` over a
    `CommRing`,
    `(Matrix.of (fun i j : Fin n => v i.succ ^ (j.val + 1) - v 0 ^ (j.val + 1))).det =
      ∏ i : Fin (n + 1), ∏ j ∈ Finset.Ioi i, (v j - v i)`.
    `nontriviality R` discharges the trivial-ring case; the main proof
    instantiates the polynomial family `p 0 = 1`,
    `p k.succ = X^(k.val + 1) - C (v 0 ^ (k.val + 1))` and applies
    `Matrix.det_eval_matrixOfPolynomials_eq_det_vandermonde`, then
    cofactor-expands along the sparse row 0 via `det_succ_row_zero` +
    `Finset.sum_eq_single 0`.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Vandermonde.lean`. Sits
  naturally alongside `det_vandermonde_sub` (the additive shift) — the
  multiplicative-style minor variant.

### [mirrored] `Pi.basisFun_dualBasis` and `LinearMap.range_dualMap_eq_span_image_dualBasis`
- **Where it bit:** `span_range_rigidityRow` in `RigidityMatroid.lean`,
  the constructive (span) form of row-rank-equals-column-rank for the
  rigidity matrix. The original proof rolled both lemmas inline: a
  pointwise `(Pi.basisFun ℝ G.edgeSet).dualBasis e = LinearMap.proj e`
  identification via `LinearMap.ext` + `simp [Pi.basisFun_repr]`, then
  a 4-rewrite chain (`Set.range_comp`, `Submodule.span_image`,
  `b.dualBasis.span_eq`, `Submodule.map_top`) for the span identity.
- **Friction:** both lemmas state genuinely general facts (no
  rigidity-specific content). `Module.Basis.dualBasis` and
  `LinearMap.dualMap` are mathlib-core, and the *dimension-level*
  version of the second fact already exists upstream as
  `LinearMap.finrank_range_dualMap_eq_finrank_range` — but the
  underlying span identity that *implies* it does not. The first
  lemma is missing because `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Dual/Basis.lean`
  does not even import `StdBasis.lean` (so there is no upstream
  file where the lemma could naturally live without a new import).
- **Resolution:** mirrored as
  - `Pi.basisFun_dualBasis` (`@[simp]`):
    `(Pi.basisFun R η).dualBasis i = LinearMap.proj i` for
    `[Finite η] [DecidableEq η]`. Two-line proof via `LinearMap.ext`
    + `simp [Pi.basisFun_repr]`.
  - `LinearMap.range_dualMap_eq_span_image_dualBasis` (Part 1 of
    Strang's Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra in span form):
    for any `b : Module.Basis ι R N` and `f : M →ₗ[R] N`,
    `LinearMap.range f.dualMap =
       Submodule.span R (Set.range (f.dualMap ∘ b.dualBasis))`.
    One-line proof via `Set.range_comp` + `Submodule.span_image` +
    `Basis.dualBasis.span_eq` + `Submodule.map_top`.

  `span_range_rigidityRow` now consumes the second lemma directly;
  its proof body is ~4 lines.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Dual/Basis.lean` (with an
  added `import Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.StdBasis` line; upstream PR
  would either add that import to `Dual/Basis.lean` or split
  `Pi.basisFun_dualBasis` to `StdBasis.lean`).

### [mirrored] `Sym2.notMem_map_some` and `Sym2.disjoint_image_map_some`
- **Where it bit:** `typeI_edgeSet_ncard`, `typeII_edgeSet_ncard`,
  `typeI_isLaman` (`h_disj`), `typeII_isLaman` (`h_disj`) — four
  disjointness obligations of the shape
  `Disjoint (Sym2.map some '' S) ({s(none, some _), …} : Set _)`
  (or its `T`/`T'` intersection variant inside `_isLaman`). Each was a
  3–4 line `rw [Set.disjoint_left]; rintro e he hpair; rcases hpair
  with rfl | …; simp at he` block.
- **Friction:** mathlib has `Sym2.mem_map` but no specialization for
  `none ∉ Sym2.map some e`, and no packaged disjointness lemma for
  the recurring "image vs Option-fresh-edges" pattern. The four call
  sites were fundamentally proving the same fact — every element of
  `Sym2.map some '' S` has both endpoints in the `some` branch, so it
  cannot equal a fresh edge containing `none` — but each call site
  re-derived this from `simp at he` after rcases.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as
  - `Sym2.notMem_map_some` (`@[simp]`): `none ∉ Sym2.map some e`.
  - `Sym2.disjoint_image_map_some`: `(∀ e ∈ T, none ∈ e) →
    Disjoint (Sym2.map some '' S) T`.

  Both `_edgeSet_ncard` lemmas now state `hDisj`'s type explicitly
  and consume it via the helper as a one-line term-mode application;
  the `_isLaman` `h_disj` blocks (where `T`/`T'` is `set`-bound and
  the type can be inferred) collapse to one or two lines via
  `Sym2.disjoint_image_map_some fun _ ⟨hpair, _⟩ => by rcases hpair
  …; simp`. Net ~7 lines across the four sites.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Sym/Sym2.lean`.

### [mirrored] `Finset.card_eraseNone_add_one_of_mem` (addition-form `eraseNone` cardinality)
- **Where it bit:** `typeI_isLaman` and `typeII_isLaman` sparsity, the
  `none ∈ s` branch's `s.card = s'.card + 1` derivation. Each occurrence
  was a 4-line `hni; hs_eq; hsc` block (`hni : none ∉ s'.image some`,
  rebuild `s = insert none (s'.image some)` by `ext; cases x`, then
  `rw [hs_eq, card_insert_of_notMem, card_image_of_injective]`).
- **Friction:** the project was using `s.preimage some _` for the
  some-preimage. Mathlib's `Finset.eraseNone` is the better-named
  computable companion and ships exactly the API needed
  (`mem_eraseNone`, `coe_eraseNone`, `card_eraseNone_of_not_mem`),
  except the `none ∈ s` cardinality lemma is in `ℕ`-subtraction form
  (`#s.eraseNone = #s - 1`). The project's coding convention forbids
  `ℕ`-subtraction, so consumers had to `Nat.sub_add_cancel` it back
  manually. Switched both `_isLaman` proofs to `s.eraseNone` and
  added the addition-form companion as a one-line mirror.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as `Finset.card_eraseNone_add_one_of_mem`
  (`#s.eraseNone + 1 = #s` under `none ∈ s`). Both `_isLaman` proofs
  collapsed each `none ∈ s` and `none ∉ s` `hsc` derivation to one
  line. Net ~9 lines saved in `typeI_isLaman`, ~18 lines in
  `typeII_isLaman`. The `Finset.Preimage` import was dropped in
  favour of `Finset.Option`. Follow-up cleanup: the three private
  `fresh_sym2_*` helpers were taking a generic `s' : Finset V` plus
  `hmem : ∀ v, v ∈ s' ↔ some v ∈ s` to abstract over which
  some-preimage was being used; with `eraseNone` standardised across
  callers, those parameters were dropped, the helpers now state their
  hypotheses directly against `s.eraseNone`, and call sites no longer
  pass `hmem`.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Finset/Option.lean`.

### [mirrored] `Set.ncard_pair_le` / `Set.ncard_triple_le` (unconditional pair / triple bounds)
- **Where it bit:** `typeI_edgeSet_ncard`, `typeII_edgeSet_ncard`,
  `typeI_isLaman` (`hT_le_2`), `typeII_isLaman` (`hT'_le_3`,
  `hT'_le_2` ×2).
- **Friction:** mathlib has `Set.ncard_pair` (`= 2` under `a ≠ b`)
  but no unconditional `≤ 2` companion. Bounding the cardinality of
  a literal pair/triple of new edges expanded to 3- and 5-line calc
  chains via `Set.ncard_insert_le` + `Set.ncard_singleton`, repeated
  five times across the file (the same 5-line block for each
  `T ⊆ {…, …}` sub-bound).
- **Resolution:** mirrored unconditional `≤` bounds. Each calc
  chain collapses to one `Set.ncard_pair_le _ _` (resp.
  `Set.ncard_triple_le _ _ _`) application.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Set/Card.lean`.

### [mirrored] `Set.ncard_eq_card_coe` (`Set.ncard ↔ Fintype.card` bridge)
- **Where it bit:** `rigidityMap_finrank_range_le` in `Framework.lean`,
  the final calc step `_ = G.edgeSet.ncard := by rw
  [Set.ncard_eq_toFinset_card', Set.toFinset_card]`.
- **Friction:** mathlib has `Set.ncard_eq_toFinset_card'` (`s.ncard =
  s.toFinset.card`) and `Set.toFinset_card` (`s.toFinset.card =
  Fintype.card s`) but no fused composite. Same shape as the existing
  [mirrored] `ncard_incidenceSet_eq_degree` (Phase 2). Filed
  pre-emptively at Phase 4 close because Phase 5 lemmas bridging
  `LinearMap.toMatrix` / `Module.finrank_pi` (Fintype-based) with the
  project's `edgeSet.ncard` rhetoric will hit it again.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as `Set.ncard_eq_card_coe : s.ncard =
  Fintype.card s` (under `[Fintype s]`); one-line proof via the
  existing two-step composition. The calc step in
  `rigidityMap_finrank_range_le` collapses to
  `(Set.ncard_eq_card_coe _).symm` (term mode). Also retroactively
  applied to the existing `ncard_incidenceSet_eq_degree` mirror, whose
  proof was the same shape routed through `Nat.card` (`rw [←
  Nat.card_coe_set_eq, Nat.card_eq_fintype_card,
  card_incidenceSet_eq_degree]` → `rw [Set.ncard_eq_card_coe,
  card_incidenceSet_eq_degree]`); this is a mirror-importing-mirror
  edge, fine because the upstream `Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/
  Finite.lean` already imports `Mathlib/Data/Set/Card.lean`.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Set/Card.lean`.

### [mirrored] `Sym2.map_some_injective` (named specialization)
- **Where it bit:** `typeI_edgeSet_ncard`, `typeII_edgeSet_ncard`,
  `typeI_isLaman`, `typeII_isLaman` — every `Set.ncard_image_of_injective`
  application on a `Sym2.map some` image.
- **Friction:** the same four-token incantation
  `Sym2.map.injective (Option.some_injective V)` was written four
  times. It correctly typechecks but is harder to read than the
  intent ("`Sym2.map some` is injective").
- **Status:** mirrored as `Sym2.map_some_injective`.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Sym/Sym2.lean`.

### [mirrored] `Sym2.exists_and_map_eq_mk_iff` (Sym2 image-membership case analysis)
- **Where it bit:** `typeI_edgeSet` (Phase 3); aborted attempt at
  `typeII_edgeSet`.
- **Friction:** Proving things of the form
  `(typeI G a b).edgeSet = (Sym2.map some '' G.edgeSet) ∪ {s(none, some a), s(none, some b)}`
  required `Sym2.ind` to expose the underlying pair `(x, y)`, then a
  4-way case analysis `rcases x with _ | u <;> rcases y with _ | v`,
  each branch closed by mixed `Sym2.eq_iff` / `Option.some.injEq` /
  `Sym2.map_mk` rewrites and `simp_all`. `aesop`, `tauto`, and bare
  `simp` each got stuck on a different sub-goal.
- **Resolution:** The right shape was a *predicate-form* simp lemma:
  `(∃ e, P e ∧ Sym2.map f e = s(x, y)) ↔ ∃ p q, f p = x ∧ f q = y ∧ P s(p, q)`.
  This is what `simp` reaches after `Set.mem_image` (a `@[simp]` lemma)
  has fired, and after any further unfolding of `e ∈ S` (e.g.
  `Set.mem_diff` for set differences), so the predicate `P` is whatever
  conjunction those unfoldings produce. The earlier sketches (e.g.
  `Sym2.map_some_mem_iff` for the `e = Sym2.map f e'` shape) didn't
  match the simp normal form and so wouldn't fire.

  With the predicate-form lemma tagged `@[simp]`, both
  `typeI_edgeSet` and `typeII_edgeSet` close in three lines:
  `ext e; induction e with | h x y => ?_; rcases x with _ | u <;>
  rcases y with _ | v <;> simp`. The companion non-`simp`
  `Sym2.mk_mem_image_map_iff` for the pre-`Set.mem_image` shape is
  also provided, alongside `f = some` specializations.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Sym/Sym2.lean`.

### [mirrored] `Sym2.coe_toFinset` (Sym2-to-Set coercion of `toFinset`)
- **Where it bit:** Phase 7 cleanup C4 walk of
  `IsSparse.exists_aug_of_lt_two_mul` (`Sparsity.lean`:1445), local
  `have h_toFinset_sub_iff : e ∈ (↑C : Set V).sym2 ↔ e.toFinset ⊆ C`
  (~10-line manual proof via `Set.mem_sym2_iff_subset` + per-direction
  `Sym2.mem_toFinset` rewrites + `exact_mod_cast`).
- **Friction:** mathlib has `Sym2.mem_toFinset : x ∈ z.toFinset ↔ x ∈ z`
  and `Set.mem_sym2_iff_subset : z ∈ s.sym2 ↔ (↑z : Set α) ⊆ s`, but no
  direct equality between the two `Set α`-valued coercions
  `(↑z.toFinset : Set α)` and `(↑z : Set α)`. Each callsite that wants
  to bridge `(↑z : Set α) ⊆ s` and `z.toFinset ⊆ s` re-proves the
  pointwise equivalence by hand.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as
  `Sym2.coe_toFinset (z : Sym2 α) [DecidableEq α] : (z.toFinset : Set α) = ↑z`.
  Tagged `@[simp]` (not `@[norm_cast]` — Lean's `norm_cast` heuristic
  rejects when both sides are coes, requiring the RHS to strictly drop
  coes). With the mirror, the `h_toFinset_sub_iff` proof collapses to a
  3-token `rw [Set.mem_sym2_iff_subset, ← Sym2.coe_toFinset, Finset.coe_subset]`
  chain.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Sym/Sym2.lean`.

### [mirrored] `(G.incidenceSet v).ncard = G.degree v`
- **Where it bit:** `IsLaman.two_le_degree` (Phase 2).
- **Friction:** mathlib has `card_incidenceSet_eq_degree` for
  `Fintype.card`, not for `Set.ncard`. We chained
  `← Nat.card_coe_set_eq, Nat.card_eq_fintype_card,
  card_incidenceSet_eq_degree` every time we needed it.
- **Status:** mirrored as `SimpleGraph.ncard_incidenceSet_eq_degree`.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Finite.lean`.

### [mirrored] `G.edgeSet.ncard = G.edgeFinset.card`
- **Where it bit:** `IsLaman.exists_degree_le_three` and
  `top_fin_two_isLaman` (Phase 1 + 2).
- **Friction:** trivial composite of `← Set.ncard_coe_finset` and
  `coe_edgeFinset`, but written out by hand each time.
- **Status:** mirrored as `SimpleGraph.ncard_edgeSet_eq_card_edgeFinset`.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Finite.lean`.

### [mirrored] `(⊤ : SimpleGraph V).edgeSet.ncard = (Fintype.card V).choose 2`
- **Where it bit:** `top_fin_two_isLaman`.
- **Friction:** mathlib's `card_edgeFinset_top_eq_card_choose_two` is
  in `Finset.card` form; the `Set.ncard` companion was missing.
- **Status:** mirrored as `SimpleGraph.ncard_edgeSet_top_eq_card_choose_two`.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Finite.lean`.

### [mirrored] `Finset.coe_compl_singleton`
- **Where it bit:** `IsLaman.two_le_degree`.
- **Friction:** singleton complement coercion is the standard
  "delete one vertex" idiom, but you have to compose
  `Finset.coe_compl` and `Finset.coe_singleton` by hand.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Finset/BooleanAlgebra.lean`.

### [mirrored] `Finset.card_compl_singleton`
- **Where it bit:** `IsLaman.two_le_degree`.
- **Friction:** as above for the cardinality side.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Fintype/Card.lean`.
  (Sibling of `coe_compl_singleton` but lands in a different upstream
  file because `Finset.card_compl` requires `Fintype α` and lives in
  `Fintype/Card.lean`, not `Finset/BooleanAlgebra.lean`.)

### [mirrored] `Finset.eq_singleton_of_mem_of_card_le_one`
- **Where it bit:** `contradiction_two_pair` and `contradiction_three_pair`
  in `Henneberg.lean` (Phase 5 milestone-1 blocker proofs); second cleanup
  pass.
- **Friction:** the `Finset.eq_of_subset_of_card_le
  (Finset.singleton_subset_iff.mpr _) (by rw [Finset.card_singleton]; omega) |>.symm`
  pattern recurs 4 times. The natural reading is "I have a member and a
  ≤ 1 cardinality bound, give me the singleton equality" — but spelled out
  it's a 3-line block per use.
- **Status:** mirrored. Each call site now reads
  `Finset.eq_singleton_of_mem_of_card_le_one hmem (by omega)`.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Finset/Card.lean`.

### [mirrored] `LinearIndependent.dualMap_of_surjective` / `LinearIndepOn.dualMap_of_surjective`
- **Where it bit:** `typeI_edgeSetRowIndependent_extend`
  (`MatroidIdentification.lean`, Phase 7). The blueprint claims a one-step
  "factor through the restriction map" for old-row LI: linear independence
  of `G'.rigidityRow p'` transports through `restrictMap.dualMap` (where
  `restrictMap = LinearMap.funLeft ℝ _ some`) to linear independence of
  the lifted `(typeI G' a b).rigidityRow p_ext ∘ lift_some`. The original
  Lean expanded this into a four-step chain: `LinearMap.funLeft_surjective_of_injective` →
  `LinearMap.dualMap_injective_of_surjective` → `LinearMap.ker_eq_bot.mpr` →
  `LinearIndependent.map'`. Phase 7's forthcoming Type II row-LI lift will
  hit the same chain.
- **Friction:** mathlib has each link (`dualMap_injective_of_surjective`
  in `Dual/Defs.lean`, `LinearIndependent.map'` in `LinearIndependent/Basic.lean`)
  but no fused `LinearIndependent.dualMap_of_surjective`. The
  `LinearIndepOn`-level companion is also absent.
  The companion big→small direction in `isSparse_of_edgeSetRowIndependent_dim_two`
  (`RigidityMatroid.lean`) uses `LinearIndependent.of_comp restrict.dualMap`
  with no surjectivity hypothesis — already a one-liner upstream, so it
  did not benefit from the new helper.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as
  - `LinearIndependent.dualMap_of_surjective`: `Surjective f → LI v → LI (f.dualMap ∘ v)`.
  - `LinearIndepOn.dualMap_of_surjective`: the `LinearIndepOn` companion.

  The Phase 7 caller collapsed the four-step chain to one
  `h_li_G'.dualMap_of_surjective h_restrict_surj` application; the
  intermediate `h_dualMap_inj` and `with hRest_def` bindings dropped.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Dual/Lemmas.lean` (with an
  added `import Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.LinearIndependent.Basic` line;
  upstream would slot under existing surjective-dual API in that file).

### [mirrored] `Sym2.mk_none_some_eq_iff` (pointwise iff for `s(none, some _)` edges)
- **Where it bit:** four `s(none, some u) ≠ s(none, some v)` proofs in
  `MatroidIdentification.lean` (Phase 7 cleanup C9): the typeI extend's
  `hAB_ne` (line 94) and the typeII extend's `hAB_ne / hAC_ne / hBC_ne`
  (lines 424-447) for the three new edges `s(none, some a/b/c)`.
- **Friction:** each `≠` proof spent 8 lines (`intro heq + apply +
  congrArg Subtype.val + Sym2.eq_iff + rcases + Option.some.inj/absurd`)
  to peel the subtype, case-split on `Sym2.eq_iff`, kill the
  contradictory `none = some _` branch, and apply `Option.some.inj`
  to the survivor. The four sites repeated the pattern verbatim. The
  near-neighbour `Sym2.mk_mem_image_map_some_iff` already in the
  mirror file handles image-membership but not the bare `s(none,
  some u) = s(none, some v) ↔ u = v` equality.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as
  `Sym2.mk_none_some_eq_iff : s((none : Option α), some u) =
  s(none, some v) ↔ u = v`. Proof is `simp` alone — the second
  `Sym2.eq_iff` disjunct's `none = some _` endpoint is killed by the
  default simp set. Each call site collapses to one line:
  `fun heq => h_ne (Sym2.mk_none_some_eq_iff.mp (congrArg Subtype.val heq))`.
  Naming `mk_none_some_eq_iff` over the proposed `optionSome_pair_eq_iff`
  matches the neighbour `Sym2.mk_mem_image_map_some_iff`.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Sym/Sym2.lean`.

### [mirrored] `Finset.univ_orderEmbOfFin` (`Finset.univ.orderEmbOfFin = id` on `Fin n`)
- **Where it bit:** `pluckerCoord_univ` and
  `extensor_ne_zero_iff_linearIndependent` in `Molecular/Extensor.lean`
  (Phase 17 `def:plucker-coords` / `def:affine-subspace-extensor`). Both
  needed `⇑(Finset.univ.orderEmbOfFin h) = (id : Fin n → Fin n)` — the
  increasing enumeration of `univ : Finset (Fin n)` is the identity — to
  reduce a `submatrix`/reindex to the original object (`Matrix.submatrix_id_id`
  for the top Plücker coordinate; the unique `powersetCard` member is
  `extensor v` itself for the nonvanishing iff).
- **Friction:** mathlib has `Finset.orderEmbOfFin_unique` (any `StrictMono`
  `f` landing in `s` equals `s.orderEmbOfFin`), but not the `univ`/`id`
  specialization, so each callsite spelled the same two-step
  `(orderEmbOfFin_unique h (fun _ => mem_univ _) strictMono_id).symm`.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as the `@[simp]` lemma `Finset.univ_orderEmbOfFin`.
  `pluckerCoord_univ` and the `hid` derivation in
  `extensor_ne_zero_iff_linearIndependent` both collapse to a one-line
  `rw [Finset.univ_orderEmbOfFin]`.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Finset/Sort.lean` (where
  `orderEmbOfFin` / `orderEmbOfFin_unique` live).

### [mirrored] `Finset.pair_eq_pair_iff` (`Finset` analogue of `Set.pair_eq_pair_iff`)
- **Where it bit:** the off-diagonal `hne` step of
  `omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent` in `Molecular/Extensor.lean`
  (Phase 17 `lem:extensor-independence`), turning an ordered-pair
  inequality into a finset-pair inequality.
- **Friction:** mathlib has `Set.pair_eq_pair_iff` but no `Finset`
  analogue, so the callsite bridged through three glue rewrites
  `rw [← Finset.coe_inj, Finset.coe_pair, Finset.coe_pair, Set.pair_eq_pair_iff]`
  for one mathematical equivalence.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as `Finset.pair_eq_pair_iff`
  (`{a,b} = {c,d} ↔ (a = c ∧ b = d) ∨ (a = d ∧ b = c)`, `[DecidableEq α]`),
  proved by exactly that `coe_inj` bridge once. The callsite collapses to
  `rw [Finset.pair_eq_pair_iff]`.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/Data/Finset/Insert.lean` (where
  `Finset.coe_pair` lives; `Set.pair_eq_pair_iff` is in
  `Mathlib/Data/Set/Insert.lean`).

### [mirrored] `Module.finrank_pi_const` (constant non-dependent `ι → M` finrank)
- **Where it bit:** `finrank_screwAssignment` in
  `Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean` (Phase 18
  `lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound`), the column-count
  `finrank (V → ScrewSpace) = D·|V|` of the rigidity matrix.
- **Friction:** mathlib has `Module.finrank_pi_fintype` for a
  *dependent* product `(i : ι) → M i` (a `∑`) and `Module.finrank_pi`
  for the scalar case `ι → R`, but no fused lemma for the constant
  non-dependent product `ι → M`, so the callsite expanded to a 5-rewrite
  chain `Module.finrank_pi_fintype` + `Finset.sum_const` +
  `Finset.card_univ` + `smul_eq_mul` collapsing the constant sum.
- **Resolution:** mirrored as `Module.finrank_pi_const`
  (`finrank R (ι → M) = Fintype.card ι * finrank R M`), proved by exactly
  that chain once. The callsite collapses to
  `rw [Module.finrank_pi_const ℝ, screwSpace_finrank, mul_comm]`.
- **Status:** mirrored.
- **Mirror file:** `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Dimension/Constructions.lean`
  (where `Module.finrank_pi_fintype` lives).
