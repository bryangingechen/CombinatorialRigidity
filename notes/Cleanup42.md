# The post-Phase-42 cleanup (planning note)

**Status:** open (2026-11-05, at the PI's word, §1), ahead of ORIGAMI; round 2, the chapter to the
Lean, in progress (`notes/Phase42-align.md`). On 2026-10-30, during 42g, the PI asked for a cleanup
phase after Phase 42 to address the informal proofs of `blueprint/src/chapter/pencil-d.tex` that
were difficult to formalize as written (§1); on 2026-11-05 the PI opened it ahead of ORIGAMI.
`.claude/autopilot/queue.toml` carries it as `CLEANUP-42`, attended, between PENCIL-D (done) and
ORIGAMI; ROADMAP *Queued post-program phases* lists it. Its input is the proof-route ledger (§2):
34 rows at Phase 42's close, 54 at the close of round 1, the route audit (`notes/Phase42-cleanup.md`,
closed 2026-11-05 at its planned stop): 34 `open`, 6 `aligned`, 14 `no departure`. The PI gave
every open row its remedy the same day, at round 1's stop and at a second stop on the B/C judgment
(§1; §3 *Round 1's stop*, *The B/C judgment*): 17 rows go `aligned` (every part to the Lean) and 17
`kept` (a part keeps both routes, with a formalization note); no row goes H, so round 3 is empty.
Round 2, opened 2026-11-05, applies them to the chapter in eight slices by layer, then one `\uses`
sweep (blueprint and notes, no Lean); each slice sets its rows' status, and the tally here. The
ledger now: none `open`, 23 `aligned`, 17 `kept`, 14 `no departure`. **Next concrete task:**
round 2's next open task (`notes/Phase42-align.md`'s **Status**); after round 2, round 4 (§3).

## 1. The PI's decisions (verbatim)

From 42g, after the recon's acceptance and the `Grade/Polygon.lean` build. The record, as the
coordinator gave it:

> PI, 2026-10-30 (42g, after the recon's acceptance and the Grade/Polygon.lean build). The
> coordinator had answered the PI's question "Which proofs are more natural, the formalized ones or
> the ones currently written?" with: the Lean routes read better for the star
> (lem:pencil-d-polygon-star: by contradiction through linearity in the first point when the
> vertices span, else a 2×2-minor functional vanishing on the span of the vertices; Y_0 ≠ 0 from
> J_0 ≠ 0) and for the insertion's one bad value (lem:pencil-d-polygon-insert: the first n members
> of F(t) are independent with span A, so F(t) is independent iff J_i + t·w ∉ A, and J_i ∉ A makes
> that line meet A at most once); the chapter reads better for part (2) of
> lem:pencil-d-polygon-normal (the explicit affine map) and for the base triangle of
> lem:pencil-d-polygons (P_0,…,P_d a basis); the cycle's placement (two cases vs one path with N =
> min(m, D)) a toss-up. It offered to bring the star and insertion proofs in line with the Lean at
> the close.
>
> The PI answered, verbatim: "Yes, we should definitely align the star and insertion proofs with
> the Lean. For the other informal proofs that were difficult to formalize in Lean, are those
> tracked somewhere? I think we'll need a cleanup phase after Phase 42 to address them."
>
> The coordinator then answered that they are tracked only in notes/Phase42g.md *Blockers* item 2,
> which the close compresses, and proposed: a tracking note notes/Cleanup42.md for a
> post-Phase-42 cleanup, queued right after Phase 42 and ahead of ORIGAMI "unless you want it
> elsewhere"; a standing rule that any recon or build whose Lean departs from the chapter's proof
> adds a row in the same commit; and that the cleanup's opening recon compare every green node of
> pencil-d.tex (42b–42f were never checked for this) with its Lean, not only the logged rows. The
> PI has not replied on the placement: record "ahead of ORIGAMI" as the coordinator's proposal,
> not the PI's decision.

What follows from it:

- The star and the insertion were aligned in 42g, in the commit that created this note (R-1, R-2).
- **The standing rule** (`notes/Phase42-design.md` §3): a recon or build of any remaining Phase 42
  layer whose Lean departs from the chapter's proof adds a row to §2 in the same commit, and a
  commit that aligns a row sets its status.
- The cleanup's opening recon compares **every green node of `pencil-d.tex`** with its Lean, not
  only the rows of §2. The nodes 42b–42f made green (PD-STATE, PD-STABLE, 42d's COUNT-A and COUNT-B,
  PD-CARRIER and 42f's six) were never checked for a departing route.

### 2026-11-05: the open, ahead of ORIGAMI, and round 1

From the coordinator's open check-in after Phase 42's close: each question, then the option the PI
chose with its description.

**PI, 2026-11-05:** (verbatim)
- Q: "CLEANUP-42 is queued but not open. It covers the pencil-d.tex proofs whose Lean departs from
  the chapter's route: 34 ledger rows, 27 still open, in notes/Cleanup42.md. Running it before
  ORIGAMI was only the coordinator's proposal, and you never answered it. Open CLEANUP-42 now, ahead
  of ORIGAMI?" — A: "Yes, open now (Recommended)" — "Open CLEANUP-42 now and record your answer as
  the placement decision (ahead of ORIGAMI) in notes/Cleanup42.md §1."
- Q: "How should the opening be shaped? The plan says the first step compares every green node of
  pencil-d.tex (99 of them) with its Lean and adds a ledger row for each departure. The rounds, and
  a fix for each open row, are then planned with you." — A: "Audit round, then stop (Recommended)"
  — "Round 1 (notes/Phase42-cleanup.md) is the full-chapter audit: opus recons sliced by layer,
  starting with 42b–42f, which were never checked, and adding ledger rows only, with no prose or
  Lean edits. Then stop so you pick a fix per open row and plan the later rounds."

What follows from it:

- **The placement is the PI's decision:** CLEANUP-42 runs now, after Phase 42 and ahead of ORIGAMI.
  It opened on 2026-11-05.
- **Round 1 is the route audit** (`notes/Phase42-cleanup.md`): Opus recons, one slice of the
  chapter's nodes per dispatch, by layer, 42b–42f first; each adds rows to §2 and re-checks the
  rows on its nodes, and edits no prose, statement, pin or Lean.
- **Then the planned stop:** the PI picks a remedy per `open` row and plans rounds 2+ (§3).

### 2026-11-05: round 1's stop, the remedies and rounds 2+

From the coordinator's relay of round 1's `NEEDS_PI` entry (`notes/Phase42-cleanup.md` *Autopilot:
for the PI*): each question, then the option the PI chose with its description.

**PI, 2026-11-05:** (verbatim)
- Q: "CLEANUP-42's audit left 34 open rows where the Lean departs from pencil-d.tex. Family A (12
  rows): the pin drops a hypothesis the node states, such as G simple, K infinite or a nonzero
  normal. Families B and C (22 rows): the Lean proves a step by another argument, or skips, adds or
  reorders steps. The remedies are L (restate the chapter to the Lean), H (a Lean helper so the
  Lean follows the chapter; offered for R-3, R-4, R-11, R-18 and R-19) and K (keep both). Which
  remedies should round 2 apply?" — A: "A: L; B/C judged per row" — "Restate the 12 family-A
  statements to their pins; R-46 is kept, as its recon recommends. Before round 2, one Opus recon
  judges each of the 22 B/C rows (which route reads better) and proposes L, K or H per row, for you
  to approve at a short second stop."
- Q: "Four 'no departure' rows are close calls where the Lean drops a hypothesis judged vacuous,
  recovered from the others, or part of the setting. R-36: no `r ∈ W`. R-38: no separate case
  `Z = V(G)`. R-44: no `ℓ ≥ 1`, vacuous at `ℓ = 0`. R-54: the generic theorem reads less where its
  case pins drop hypotheses. Reopen any of them as open rows?" — A: "Reopen none (Recommended)" —
  "Leave all four as recorded. They are encodings or vacuous drops, with nothing to align."
- Q: "How should the rounds after the audit run? The proposal: round 2 brings the chapter to the
  Lean (blueprint and notes only, about 11 tasks, including the two prose slips and the 60 missing
  \uses edges). Round 3 is Lean helpers, only if a row goes H (1–6 tasks). Round 4 is the 'also
  left' items, Lean, about 5–7 tasks: the Theorem S fold, the d = 3 reduction fold, and non-vacuity
  witnesses at K₂ and K_{2,3}." — A: "The proposal as written (Recommended)" — "Prose round first,
  then helpers if any, then the folds and witnesses last, since they reverse imports and move d = 3
  pins."

What follows from it:

- **Family A** (§3 *Round 1's stop*): each statement restated to its pin (L), except R-46, kept
  (K) as its recon leans.
- **Families B and C** (22 rows): one Opus recon proposes L, K or H per row, with which route reads
  better; a short second stop, at which the PI approves or amends, precedes round 2.
- **No close call reopened:** R-36, R-38, R-44 and R-54 stay `no departure`.
- **Rounds 2+ as proposed** (§3): round 2 the chapter to the Lean (no Lean), round 3 Lean helpers if
  any row goes H, round 4 the *Also left to it* items.

### 2026-11-05: the B/C judgment's scope, the argument parts of family A

From the coordinator's question before the B/C judgment recon: the question, then the option the PI
chose with its description.

**PI, 2026-11-05:** (verbatim)
- Q: "Your answer at round 1's stop sent family A's 12 statements to their pins (L) and the 22 B/C
  rows to a per-row judgment. But 7 family-A rows also have an argument or step part (R-15, R-25,
  R-28, R-29, R-30, R-33, R-35). Restating their statements doesn't touch their proofs, so those
  parts are unjudged. Should the B/C recon also propose L/K/H for those 7 parts?" — A: "Yes, include
  them (Recommended)" — "The recon judges the 22 B/C rows plus the 7 argument/step parts, the 7 in a
  separate list, so the second stop settles every proof route at once."

What follows from it:

- **The B/C judgment covers 29 parts:** the 22 rows of families B and C, and, in a separate list,
  the argument or step parts of R-15, R-25, R-28 to R-30, R-33 and R-35, whose statements already
  go L (§3 *The B/C judgment*).
- **The second stop settles every proof route at once:** with family A's statements (L, R-46 K), it
  leaves no open row's remedy for round 2 to ask.

### 2026-11-05: the second stop, the B/C judgment approved

From the coordinator's relay of the B/C judgment (§3 *The B/C judgment*): the two questions, the
PI's replies, the coordinator's answer to them, then the PI's decision.

**PI, 2026-11-05:** (verbatim)
- Q: "CLEANUP-42's second stop. The recon proposes, for the 22 family-B/C rows: L (restate the
  chapter's proof to the Lean's route) for R-9, R-14, R-19, R-20, R-21, R-24, R-26, R-32, R-34; K
  (keep both, add a one-sentence remark naming the Lean's route) for the other 13; no H (Lean
  helper) anywhere. Its main close call is R-18 (the base case's rank, K): with R-19 at L, the
  reduction section would read ranks by motions in the base case but by the block-triangular splice
  for parallel edges, while at d = 3 both use the splice. Approve?" — options "Approve as proposed"
  and "Approve, R-18 also L". The PI: "What are the criteria that were used?"
- Q: "For the 7 argument/step parts of family-A rows (their statements already go L), the recon
  proposes L for R-25, R-30, R-33, R-35 and R-29's (T2); K for R-15, R-28 and the rest of R-29. Only
  R-25 and R-35 are forced: dropping the hypothesis breaks the chapter's argument (R-25's cases miss
  `u` alone in H; R-35 needs the sentence that q^⊥ is 3-dimensional exactly when q ≠ 0). Approve?" —
  options "Approve as proposed" and "Only the forced ones L". The PI: "Same question as before".
- The coordinator's answer (a summary, not the PI's words): the recon's one question was which
  proof reads better for a reader of the chapter, calibrated on the PI's call of 2026-10-30, and its
  reasons apply six rules. (1) L where the Lean's proof is shorter in the chapter's own tools (R-9,
  R-14, R-20, R-24, R-30, R-32 to R-34). (2) K where the chapter's is the explicit or standard
  argument and the Lean's a formalization shortcut (R-3, R-4, R-11, R-17, R-27, R-31). (3) K where
  the two are the same argument in other words (R-10, R-15, R-16, R-28). (4) L for consistency
  within the chapter: a sibling node already on the Lean's route (R-21, R-26, R-29's (T2)), or the
  proof's "we follow" sentence (R-19; the coordinator noted that the recon's reason overstates
  this, as R-19's closing remark already says its count of motions departs from the `d = 3` one).
  (5) Ties to K, the cheaper remedy (R-5, R-10, R-23); R-53 K as checked on the spot. (6) H only
  where the reader gains, so none. For the 7 parts, also: whether the restated statement breaks
  the chapter's proof (forced for R-25 and R-35 only).
- The PI: "OK, I approve the table in that case"

What follows from it:

- **The table is approved as proposed** (§3 *The B/C judgment*): of the 22 rows, L for R-9, R-14,
  R-19 to R-21, R-24, R-26, R-32, R-34 and K for the other 13 (R-18 stays K); of the 7 parts, L for
  R-25, R-30, R-33, R-35 and R-29's (T2), K for R-15, R-28 and the rest of R-29; no H, so no round 3.
- **Every open row has its remedy:** with family A's statements (L, R-46 K), round 2 opens on them,
  with its own work log (§3).

## 2. The proof-route ledger

One row per node of `pencil-d.tex` whose Lean proof departs from the chapter's, in the chapter's
notation. *Status* is `open`; or `aligned` with the commit that made the chapter and the Lean follow
one route (`this commit` in that commit; a later edit may replace it with the sha); or `kept` with
the commit that kept both routes, each valid, at the PI's choice, and put a formalization note
naming the Lean's route after the node's proof; or `no departure` for a row raised and then judged a
carrier encoding of the chapter's own object, kept as a short row so that the cleanup's recon does
not raise it again. A row is `aligned` only when every part of it went to the Lean; a row with any
part kept is `kept`, its *Remedies* naming each part's remedy (R-15, R-28 and R-29 restate a
statement and keep an argument). Round 2 writes `round 2 task <N>` for the commit, and its close
replaces it with the sha (`notes/Phase42-align.md` *Scope and standing rules*). *Remedies* are the
options: the prose to the Lean, a Lean helper so that the Lean can follow the chapter, or keep both
routes, each valid. The cleanup chose one per `open` row, with the PI (§1, §3). Round 1's rows (from
R-35) name their task in `notes/Phase42-cleanup.md`, and its re-checks of R-1 to R-34 are recorded
there.

- **R-1** · `lem:pencil-d-polygon-star` (`exists_normalsJoin_notMem_span_polygon`,
  `Pencil/Grade/Polygon.lean`) · **aligned, this commit** (42g).
  *Chapter (until then):* CERT S4's two basis arguments. If the vertices span, `d + 1` of them form
  a basis whose pairwise joins form a basis of `⋀²`, not all in `W(Y)`; otherwise extend `Y_i`,
  then `u ∉ S`, to a basis, and `Y_i ∨ u` is a basis vector outside `⋀²S ⊇ W(Y)`, with `Y_i ≠ 0`
  from part (1) of `lem:pencil-d-polygon-normal`.
  *Lean:* by contradiction through linearity of the join in its first point when the vertices span;
  otherwise a 2 × 2-minor functional, `ψ₂` vanishing on the span of the vertices, kills `W(Y)` but
  not `Y_0 ∨ u`; `Y_0 ≠ 0` from `J_0 ≠ 0`.
  *Remedies:* the prose to the Lean, taken; the proof's `\uses` is now `def:extensor` (the remark
  after it, for linearity), not `-normal`.
- **R-2** · `lem:pencil-d-polygon-insert` (`exists_insertNth_linearIndependent_join`, with
  `eq_of_add_smul_mem_of_add_smul_mem`) · **aligned, this commit** (42g).
  *Chapter (until then):* CERT S5's minor: `F(t)` as an `(m + 1) × D` coordinate matrix with one
  row affine in `t`, and an `(m + 1)`-minor `δ(t) = δ(0) + t δ₁` with `δ(0) ≠ 0` has one root at
  most.
  *Lean:* the first `m` members of `F(t)` are independent with span `A`, so `F(t)` is independent
  iff `J_i + t w ∉ A` (`w = u ∨ Y_{i+1}`); `J_i ∉ A`, so that line meets `A` once at most.
  *Remedies:* the prose to the Lean, taken.
- **R-3** · `lem:pencil-d-polygon-normal`, part (2) (`exists_linearEquiv_polygon_normal`) ·
  **kept, round 2 task 2**.
  *Chapter:* the explicit affine map `g(x̄, ω) = (M(x̄ − ω ȳ_i), ω)`, `M` sending a basis that
  extends `ȳ_{i−1} − ȳ_i`, `ȳ_{i+1} − ȳ_i` to the standard basis of `K^d`.
  *Lean:* extend the basis map `Y_{i−1}, Y_i, Y_{i+1} ↦ P_1, P_0, P_2` of part (1) to an
  equivalence `g₁` (`Submodule.exists_linearEquiv_restrict_eq`), then correct its last coordinate
  by the transvection `v ↦ v + φ(v) P_0`, `φ = f ∘ g₁⁻¹ − f`, `f` the last coordinate.
  *Remedies:* keep both (the coordinator judged the chapter's the better read); a Lean helper, a
  split of `K^{d+1}` as `K^d × K` on which `g` is the chapter's block map; or the prose to the Lean.
  Keep both, taken: a formalization note after the proof names the Lean's route (the PI,
  2026-11-05).
- **R-4** · `lem:pencil-d-polygons`, the base triangle (`linearIndependent_join_triangle`) ·
  **kept, round 2 task 2**.
  *Chapter:* `P_0, …, P_d` is a basis of `K^{d+1}`, so the `P_α ∨ P_β` (`α < β`) form a basis of
  `⋀²`, of which the triangle's three joins are three, up to sign.
  *Lean:* three 2 × 2-minor functionals, on the coordinate pairs first–second, first–last and
  second–last, separate the three joins; no basis of `⋀²`.
  *Remedies:* keep both (the coordinator judged the chapter's the better read); a Lean helper, the
  basis of `⋀²` induced by a basis of `K^{d+1}` (mathlib's, or a mirror), so that the Lean follows
  the chapter; or the prose to the minors, which the star's proof now uses (R-1). Keep both, taken:
  a formalization note after the proof names the Lean's route (the PI, 2026-11-05).
- **R-5** · `thm:pencil-d-cycle`, the placement (`Graph.X0AttainsGrade.of_cycle`,

  *Chapter:* two cases, CERT S6 (C1) and S7 (a): for `m ≤ D` the bodies at the vertices of a closed
  `m`-gon (`lem:pencil-d-polygons`); for `m > D` on a closed `D`-gon by part (1) of
  `lem:pencil-d-polygon-collapse`.
  *Lean (the landed proof, rechecked at the Chain build; it is the spike's):* one path, a closed
  `N`-gon with `N = min(m, D)` and every `c_j` at `Y_{π(j)}`, `π = polygonCollapse N m`, the
  identity when `N = m`.
  *Remedies:* a toss-up (the coordinator): the prose to the one path, or keep both. Keep both,
  taken: a formalization note after the proof names the Lean's route (the PI, 2026-11-05).
- **R-6** · `thm:pencil-d-cycle`, the heights (`Graph.X0AttainsGrade.of_cycle_of_certificate`) ·
  **no departure** (42g's close): the Lean restricts `z` to `V(G)`, where the chapter's `z` lives.
- **R-7** · `lem:pencil-d-two-stars`, parts (2) and (3) (`dualAnnihilator_starGrade_sup_starGrade`,
  `finrank_add_two_le_of_forall_ιMulti_eq_zero`, `Pencil/Grade/Stars.lean`) · **aligned, this
  commit** (42h).
  *Chapter (until then):* the annihilator in `⋀^{d−1}` is `y ∧ y' ∧ ⋀^{d−3}`; (3) for every
  `p ≥ 0`, through bases `e_I` of `⋀^p Q`.
  *Lean:* the annihilator is the forms on `⋀²` (the chapter's pairing), (2) the forms through
  `⋀²(K^{d+1}/⟨y, y'⟩)`, (3) at `p = d − 3` only: a nonzero form whose radical holds `A` has
  `dim A + 2 ≤ dim V`. No exterior power past `⋀²`.
  *Remedies:* the prose to the Lean, taken at the PI's word (`notes/Phase42-design.md` §1,
  2026-10-31): parts (2) and (3) and the section's annihilator on forms, the `⋀^{d−1}` reading
  kept in one sentence; the `⋀^{d−1}` bridge declined. `lem:pencil-d-stars-three`'s proof cites
  the restated parts, on forms since 42i (R-13).
- **R-8** · `lem:pencil-d-stars-four` (`exists_mvPolynomial_starsFour`,

  *Chapter (until then):* `M(y)` on `⋀^{d−3}`, `ζ ↦ y₁ ∧ y₃ ∧ ζ` modulo `ρ°` and paired with
  `J₂`; the first-order `δ_w`, then two-stars (3) in `Q` to reach `d − 1 ≤ d − 3`.
  *Lean:* the kernel curve on the family `ρ`'s basis, the path joins, `y₁ ∨ e_l`, `y₃ ∨ e_l`, whose
  annihilator is `W° ∩ Σ°`; a nonzero `φ₀` in it extends to `φ₁` along `y₃ + t w`; `φ₁` kills `W`
  (at `w = y₄`, then every `w`), so `φ₀ (w ∨ ·) = 0` for every `w`, and `φ₀ = 0`. The independence
  of `y₁`, `y₃` is not used.
  *Remedies:* the prose to the Lean, taken at the PI's word (`notes/Phase42-design.md` §1,
  2026-10-31); its `\uses` are now two-stars, the kernel curve and
  `lem:pencil-x0-fibre-intersection`, what the Lean calls.
- **R-9** · `lem:pencil-d-kernel-curve` (`exists_mvPolynomial_kernel_curve`,
  `exists_mulVec_add_mulVec_eq_zero`, 42h recon) · **aligned, round 2 task 3**.
  *Chapter (until then):* Cramer's rule over `K(t)`: `ξ(t) = (−A(t)⁻¹B(t)ξ₀|_{C'}, ξ₀|_{C'})`, a
  power series, whose coefficient of `t` is `ξ₁`.
  *Lean:* if no `ξ₁` exists, `M_wξ₀ ∉ range M(y₀)`. With `M(y₀)u_j` a basis of that range, of
  dimension `r`, the family `M(y₀ + tw)u_j`, `M_wξ₀ + tM₂(t)ξ₀` is independent at `t = 0`, hence
  at some `t ≠ 0`, and lies in the range of `M(y₀ + tw)`, which sends `t⁻¹ξ₀` to its last member;
  so `M(y₀ + tw)` has rank `r + 1`, against the generic rank. The generic minor is the same.
  *Remedies:* the prose to the Lean (no power series), or keep both. The prose to the Lean, taken
  (the PI, 2026-11-05).
- **R-10** · `lem:pencil-d-ear-data`, part (3) (`exists_mvPolynomial_earDataGrade_of_smul`, 42h
  recon) · **kept, round 2 task 3**.
  *Chapter:* a nonzero multihomogeneous component `f_α`; `g(s) = f_α(y(s))`, and at `g(s) ≠ 0` the
  polynomial `λ ↦ f((λ_x y_x)_x)` has coefficient `f_α(y) ≠ 0` at `λ^α`.
  *Lean:* `h(λ, s) = f((λ_x y_x(s))_x)` is nonzero (a point of the planes with nonzero last
  coordinates, rescaled to an ear datum by part (2)); `g` is a nonzero coefficient of `h` as a
  polynomial in `λ` (`MvPolynomial.sumAlgEquiv`). Same coefficient argument, no `f_α`.
  *Remedies:* the prose to the Lean, or keep both (a toss-up). Keep both, taken: a formalization
  note after the proof names the Lean's route (the PI, 2026-11-05).

  `finrank_starGrade_sup_starGrade`, 42h build) · **kept, round 2 task 3**.
  *Chapter:* `e₁ = y`, `e₂ = y'` extended to a basis; the sum of the stars is spanned by the
  `e_i ∧ e_j` with `i ≤ 2`, and the `e_i ∧ e_j` with `3 ≤ i < j` go to a basis of `⋀²Q`.
  *Lean:* a linear section `s` of the quotient map, `P = s ∘ mkQ`:
  `a ∨ b − P a ∨ P b = (a − P a) ∨ b − (b − P b) ∨ P a` lies in the sum of the stars, so every
  `ω` is `⋀²P ω` modulo it, and `⋀²P` vanishes on the kernel; the dimension by rank–nullity.
  *Remedies:* keep both (the basis also carries the `⋀^{d−1}` reading of part (2) in the chapter);
  a Lean helper, mathlib's `Basis.exteriorPower`, so that the Lean follows the chapter; or the

  `p_a`, `p_b` independent, and its minor entered the polynomial; the statement also took `d ≥ 4`.
  *Lean:* forms on `⋀²` as stars-four's (R-8). The dual kernel curve runs for `starsFamily` at two
  interior points. Moving `y₁` along `p_a`, then any `u ∈ Π_a`, and `y₃` along `p_b`, then any
  `w ∈ Π_b`, puts `Π_a + Π_b` in the radical of `φ₀`. `y₁`, `y₃` are independent off a coordinate

  `a`, `b` lie in one component (else `ρ` is everything), and a path joins them
  (`lem:relative-screws-path`) with at least four edges. So they are not adjacent and have no
  common neighbour, and glued-ends gives `r = 3`.

  at the first stage's base data (`Pq = g`, glued-ends' polynomial or `1`; `Rz` planes-meet's) for
  `ρ = joinRelScrews` of `G[V₁]`. When `r ≤ 2`, `dim ρ ≤ 2` directly: by glued-ends when the closed
  neighbourhoods of `a` and `b` are disjoint, and otherwise a common member `t` gives
  `ρ ⊆ span(b_a ∨ b_t, b_t ∨ b_b)` from the motions (`joinRelScrews_le_span_of_mem_closedNbhd`). So
  there is no component step and no path lemma, and a span with both stars is impossible at

  `range (gradeSigma la) ⊓ range (gradeSigma lb)`. A fixed inverse three-point matrix

  rank openness (`exists_mvPolynomial_le_finrank_span_of_repr`) at a height whose first `min(m, r)`

  2+ (`notes/Phase42-cleanup.md` *Autopilot: for the PI*).
- **Between rounds 1 and 2: the B/C judgment** (the PI, 2026-11-05, §1). One Opus recon reads
  each of the 22 rows of families B and C (*Round 1's stop*, below), and, at the PI's later word
  (§1), the 7 argument or step parts of family A rows, against the chapter and the Lean, and
  proposes L, K or H with a one-line reason (which route reads better), in one docs commit (a
  per-row table in this section, after *Round 1's stop*; read-only otherwise, no row's status
  changed). Landed 2026-11-05 (*The B/C judgment*, below), and approved as proposed by the PI at
  the second stop the same day (§1); round 2 opened then, with its own work log (below).
- **Rounds 2+** (planned with the PI at round 1's stop, §1: the proposal as written): round 2, the
  chapter to the Lean (blueprint and notes, no Lean; family A's L rows, the B/C rows the PI sends
  L, a remark for each K row, the *Moved* lines below and the `\uses` sweep; about 11 tasks);
  round 3, Lean helpers, only if a row goes H (none did, at the second stop, §1); round 4, the
  three items *Also left to it* below.
  - **Round 2, the chapter to the Lean** (opened 2026-11-05, `notes/Phase42-align.md`): 11 tasks,
    one commit each. After the open, eight slices by layer as round 1's (42b with 42g; 42h; 42i
    with 42j; 42k; 42l; 42m in three) apply each open row's remedy: the 11 family-A statements
    and 14 proof routes that go L restated to their Lean, each set `aligned`; a formalization note
    after the proof for each of the 17 kept parts, its row set `kept` (§2's header); the two prose
    slips below in their layers' slices. Then the `\uses` sweep (task 10) and the close (task 11).
    No Lean, pin or `\leanok` changes.
  - **Round 3** is empty: no row went H (§1, the second stop).
  - **Round 4**, the *Also left to it* items below and round 1's stale docstring (Lean), opens after
    round 2's close.

  Round 1's and round 2's *Candidates for the PI* and *Moved to a later round* lines are mirrored
  here as they land, each with the task that takes it:
  - *Moved to a later round* (round 1 task 2; round 2 task 10, the sweep):
    `lem:pencil-d-point-configuration`'s statement reads the closed neighbourhood
    (`Graph.closedNbhd`, pinned by `def:pencil-nondegenerate` in `pencil.tex`) with no `\uses` edge
    to it, which `scripts/blueprint-deps.py` reports *missing*. The script reports 60 missing edges
    over the chapter (`--chapter pencil-d`), so a later round may take them in one sweep.
  - *Moved to a later round* (round 1 task 10; round 2 task 3, taken: `s` in both places): a prose
    slip. `thm:pencil-d-open-ear-four`'s proof calls an ear datum `y` ("Take an ear datum $y$ off
    all three zero sets", then "Keep the other points of $y$"), where `def:pencil-d-ear-data` and
    the same proof's first stage (`s^*`) write `s` for ear data, and the section writes `y` for
    points (`y_1`, `y_3`, …).
  - *Moved to a later round* (round 1 task 13; round 2 task 6, taken: `p : K^{d′+1} → K^{d+1}`,
    the embedding's direction, with R-48's statement): a prose slip.
    `lem:pencil-d-nondegenerate-maps` fixes `p : K^(d+1) → K^(d′+1)`, so (2)'s injective `p`
    has `d ≤ d′`, but its "in particular" embeds a realization in dimension `d′ ≤ d` into dimension
    `d` (the letters of `lem:pencil-d-embed-realization`), a map `K^(d′+1) → K^(d+1)`: `d` and `d′`
    swap roles within one statement.
  - *Moved to a later round* (round 1 task 15; round 4, as it edits Lean): a stale docstring.
    `Grade/LiftNoRigid.lean`'s module docstring names `mem_liftMaps_pencilConfigPoint_iff` among the
    steps stated "for `lem:pencil-d-ear-free`" (`L(b⁰) = L(q)` in the maps), but its one caller is
    `liftAttains_of_forall_deficiency_two_ne_zero`: the Lean of `-ear-free` never reads `L(b⁰)`
    (R-34) and calls only the other two it names.
  - *Moved to a later round* (round 2 task 3; round 4, as it edits Lean): a stale docstring.
    `Grade/Stars.lean`'s `exists_mulVec_add_mulVec_eq_zero` ends "The chapter argues by Cramer's
    rule over `K(t)` instead" (R-9), and its first line's "without `K(t)`" contrasts it with that
    proof; since R-9's alignment the chapter's proof of `lem:pencil-d-kernel-curve` is the Lean's.
  - *Moved to a later round* (round 2 task 4; round 4, as it edits Lean): a stale docstring.
    `Grade/ShortThree.lean`'s `Graph.X0AttainsGrade.of_openEar_three` ends "The chapter's proof of
    the case `r ≤ 2` goes instead through the components of `G[V₁]` and a path from `a` to `b`"
    (R-14); since R-14's alignment the chapter bounds `dim ρ ≤ 2` as the Lean does, by glued-ends
    or a common member of the closed neighbourhoods of `a` and `b`.
  - *Moved to a later round* (round 2 task 6; round 4, as it edits Lean): a stale docstring.
    `Grade/LiftWitness.lean`'s `liftAttains_of_least` says the Lean takes the lift's maps through
    the polynomial section "in place of the chapter's Cramer basis and coefficients `γ`" (R-21);
    since R-21's alignment the chapter's proof of `lem:pencil-d-lift-one-witness` is that route.
  - *Moved to a later round* (round 2 task 6; round 4, a note outside round 2's writes): a dated
    sentence. `notes/BlueprintExposition.md`'s 42l entry (judged 2026-11-04) says that the nodes
    keep "the one-lift and restriction lemmas' unused simplicity and feasibility hypotheses";
    R-49 dropped the simplicity. Its list of route differences left (R-20, R-21, R-23) is dated
    likewise, as the 42h entry's is since R-9.
  - *Moved to a later round* (round 2 task 7; round 4, as it edits Lean): three stale docstrings.
    `Grade/LiftSmall.lean`'s module docstring ends "It needs no `G.Simple` and no `[Infinite K]`,
    which the chapter assumes" (R-28, R-51); `Grade/LiftCutEdge.lean`'s `liftAttains_of_cutEdge`
    ends "The chapter's `|V₁|, |V₂| ≥ 2` is not needed" (R-30); `Grade/LiftNoRigid.lean`'s
    `exists_pencilConfigPoint_of_dotProduct` says "The chapter reaches the two nonzero coordinates
    by a map `g` of `K⁴`" (R-32). Since task 7 the chapter's statements and proofs are the Lean's.
  - *Moved to a later round* (round 2 task 7; round 4, a note outside round 2's writes): a dated
    sentence. `notes/BlueprintExposition.md`'s 42m entry (judged 2026-11-05) lists "the cut edge's
    glue by one frame map and one minor" and "the least lift space through the lifting system
    without the chapter's map `g`" among the route differences left, and "the cut edge's side
    sizes" and "`-lift-small` (2)'s simplicity" among the hypotheses the pins drop; R-30, R-32 and
    R-28 put the chapter on those routes and statements.
  - *Moved to a later round* (round 2 task 8; round 4, as it edits Lean, and a note outside round
    2's writes): a stale docstring and a dated sentence. `Grade/LiftCases.lean`'s module docstring
    ends "The chapter's two statements are kept in the pins' stronger form: the pendant drops
    "whose neighbour has another neighbour" and the ear drops "not adjacent"" (R-25, R-29); since
    task 8 the two statements are their pins'. `notes/BlueprintExposition.md`'s 42m entry lists
    "the cases' polynomials by one minor per closed hub-neighbourhood" and "one form per body in
    (T2)" among the route differences left, and "the pendant's other neighbour" and "the ear's
    non-adjacency" among the hypotheses the pins drop; R-24, R-26, R-25 and R-29 put the chapter on
    those routes and statements.
  - *Moved to a later round* (round 2 task 9; round 4, as it edits Lean, and a note outside round
    2's writes): two stale docstrings and a dated sentence. `Grade/EarFree.lean`'s
    `exists_earExtend_poly` ends "The chapter's moment curve and its case analysis on `O_v` are not
    used" (R-33), and `isTrivialLift_of_finrank_liftSpaceTilde_le` ends "The chapter's count
    `dim L̃ = dim L(b⁰) + |X|` is not used" (R-34); since task 9 the chapter's proofs are those
    routes. `notes/BlueprintExposition.md`'s 42m entry lists "`E_L` by one witness per condition
    with the normals chosen greedily" and "every lift of the rest of the rigid set trivial by an
    embedding without the count of its maps" among the route differences left, and
    "`-ear-extend`'s simplicity" among the hypotheses the pins drop; R-33 and R-34 put the chapter
    on those routes and that statement.
- **The ledger at Phase 42's close:** the standing rule (§1) kept §2 current through PD-STEPS's
  rest, PD-COVERAGE, PD-REDUCTION and PD-HEAD (`notes/Phase42-design.md` §3), the last rows 42m's,
  R-24 to R-34; Phase 42 closed on 2026-11-05 with no row added after them. Round 1 adds from R-35.
- **Also left to it** (not a route row): Theorem S's fold, `Graph.IsX0Graph.exists_additiveCore`
  (`MainComponent/CoverageTheoremS.lean`) as the `n = 3` case of
  `Graph.IsX0Graph.exists_additiveCoreAt` (`Grade/TheoremS.lean`, which imports that file), with a
  bridge `Graph.ChainUsable ↔ Graph.ChainUsableAt 3`. It reverses the import, so COUNT-B's
  lemmas move upstream of the `d = 3` coverage; no node of PD-COVERAGE uses Theorem S at `D` (42j's
  recon, `notes/Phase42j.md`).
- **Also left to it** (not a route row): the `d = 3` cases of the reduction (`Pencil/Arms.lean`,
  `hasPencilRealization_of_not_simple` in `Pencil/X0.lean`) as the `m = 1` case of 42k's graded
  ones (`Grade/Arms.lean`, `Grade/Reduction.lean`) through `hasGradedPencilRealization_two_iff`. It
  reverses the imports, as Theorem S's fold does (FRICTION *42k's cases repeat the `d = 3` cases'
  proofs*).
- **Also left to it** (not a route row): two instances no `main_results` witness exhibits. (1) The
  generic conjunct's hypothesis at a small graph. Phase 42's one `main_results` row, the headline
  `Graph.graded_pencil_conditioned_pair`, has a witness of its distinct conjunct only (the PI's
  (A) without (C), `notes/Phase42-design.md` §1, 2026-11-05), as the two `d = 3` pencil rows do,
  so no row's witness meets the generic conjunct's feasibility hypothesis, whose satisfiability
  `#print axioms` cannot see (F-207, F-252). The likely witness: `K₂`, by
  `PencilNondegFeasible.mono` from `exists_isNondegPencilRealization_parallel_pair` through
  `gradedPencilNondegFeasible_iff` (not spiked). (2) Beside it, an instance of the two predicates
  42m introduced, `Graph.IsPencilGoodEar` and `EarLiftCondition`; the candidate is `K_{2,3}`
  (`W₀` all five bodies, `x` a body of degree two; `s(W₀) = 3·4 − 2·6 = 0`, `X` a four-cycle with
  `s = 1`; `notes/Phase42m.md` *Blockers*). It would witness an inner arm of the induction, not a
  hypothesis of the headline.

### Round 1's stop: the open rows by family (2026-11-05)

The 34 `open` rows at round 1's close, by the kind of departure the audit's criterion names
(`notes/Phase42-cleanup.md` *The audit's criterion*); each row's full text is in §2. A row with a
statement part goes under A, its argument or step part marked (B) or (C) and named again under that
family. The remedies, as the rows give them: **L**, the prose (under A, the statement) to the Lean;
**H**, a Lean helper so that the Lean follows the chapter; **K**, keep both. *Lean:* the recon's or
the coordinator's recorded lean, if any. The PI's questions are the `NEEDS_PI` entry of
`notes/Phase42-cleanup.md` *Autopilot: for the PI*.

**A. The pin is stronger than its node** (12): a hypothesis of the node the Lean does not take.
- R-15 `lem:pencil-d-planes-meet`: no `K` infinite (the row's *Lean*; its remedies omit it); `R` by
  rank openness, no `λ` (B). K, L (the argument). No lean.
- R-25 `lem:pencil-d-lift-pendant` (T1): no "`u` has another neighbour"; the split on `u` a hub of
  `G` (B). L (it also strikes `thm:pencil-d-generic`'s derived clause, R-54), K. No lean.
- R-28 `lem:pencil-d-lift-small` (2): no `G` simple; the lift space never a product (C). L, K. No
  lean.
- R-29 `lem:pencil-d-lift-pendant-triangle`, with the pins of `-lift-pendant` and `-lift-ear`: the
  ear's pin takes no `a ≁ b` (the pendant's drop is R-25); (T1) by polarity, (T2) one form `ψ_c`,
  no deficiency of the triangle (B). L, K. No lean.
- R-30 `lem:pencil-d-lift-cut-edge`: no `|V₁|, |V₂| ≥ 2`; one frame map, one minor, no case
  analysis on `|S|`, no replaced normal (B). L, K. No lean.
- R-33 `lem:pencil-d-ear-extend`: no `G` simple, no neighbour selector; one witness per condition,
  the `n_u` chosen greedily (B). L, K. No lean.
- R-35 `lem:pencil-d-agrees-three`, its first sentence: no `q_v ≠ 0`; a sentence added, `q^⊥`
  three-dimensional exactly when `q ≠ 0` (C). L, K. Lean: the recon, L.
- R-46 `lem:pencil-d-two-pencil-extension` (1), (2): no nonzero normals, dimension or `b ∈ Π`,
  `b_u ≠ 0` in (2)'s last claim only; (3)'s pin calls (1) outside the setting. L, K. Lean: the
  recon, K.
- R-48 `lem:pencil-d-nondegenerate-maps` (1), (2): any vectors and subspaces (the nonzero normals
  recovered, the dimension and `b_v ∈ Π_v` not). L, K. Lean: the recon, L.
- R-49 `lem:pencil-d-steer`, `-lift-one-witness`, `-lift-transfer`: no `G` simple (the parallel
  pair, feasible and not simple, meets the pins). L, K. Lean: the recon, L.
- R-50 `lem:pencil-d-lift-realization` (2), (3): (2) takes only the incidences, (3) any
  `(b⁰, Π⁰)`; four of (2)'s five callers are outside the node's setting. L, K. Lean: the recon, L.
- R-51 `lem:pencil-d-lift-small`: no `K` infinite (the three pins apply over `ZMod 2`). L, K. Lean:
  the recon, L.

**B. A different argument for a step** (16). Also the argument parts of R-15, R-25, R-29, R-30 and
R-33 (under A) and of R-14, R-17 and R-32 (under C).
- R-3 `lem:pencil-d-polygon-normal` (2): a basis map extended, then a transvection, not the
  explicit affine map. K, H (`K^{d+1}` as `K^d × K`, `g` a block map), L. Lean: the coordinator, K
  (the chapter reads better).
- R-4 `lem:pencil-d-polygons`, the base triangle: three 2 × 2 minors, no basis of `⋀²`. K, H (the
  basis of `⋀²` a basis of `K^{d+1}` induces), L. Lean: the coordinator, K.
- R-9 `lem:pencil-d-kernel-curve`: a rank count at some `t ≠ 0`, not Cramer's rule over `K(t)` (no
  power series). L, K. No lean.
- R-10 `lem:pencil-d-ear-data` (3): a coefficient of `h(λ, s)` in `λ`, no component `f_α`. L, K.
  Lean: a toss-up.
- R-11 `lem:pencil-d-two-stars` (1): a linear section of the quotient and rank–nullity, not a
  basis. K, H (`Basis.exteriorPower`), L. No lean.
- R-16 `lem:pencil-d-glued-ends`: no merged deficiency (a partition of `G′` pulled back),
  Jackson–Jordán's polynomial for the edge coordinates, `X` split in two, not into its components
  (C). K, L (the `\uses` drops `def:deficiency-merged`). No lean.
- R-18 `lem:pencil-d-base-case`: the rank bounded below by a hinge's rows and above by the target,
  not read off the motions. L, H (the motions of one edge), K. No lean.
- R-19 `lem:pencil-d-nonsimple-case`: the rank by the splice at every `D`, not by the motions of
  `G/H` with `S(w) = S(u)`. L (it also widens the closing remark), H (those motions), K. No lean.
- R-20 `lem:pencil-d-nondegenerate-feasible`: forms chosen off at most two proper subspaces; no
  quotient, induction or quadric. L, K. No lean.
- R-21 `lem:pencil-d-lift-one-witness`: one polynomial section, no Cramer basis and no `γ`. L, K.
  No lean.
- R-23 `lem:pencil-d-lift-transfer`: openness by the rank polynomial at each `λ`, not through
  (T2). L, K. No lean.
- R-26 `lem:pencil-d-lift-pendant`, `-lift-ear` (T2): one form on `K⁴` per body, not `φ` on
  `Π⁰`. L, K. No lean.
- R-27 `lem:pencil-d-lift-small` (1), the triangle: the joins by minors at a dual triple; no
  partition values, the rank at most the target and the deficiency nonnegative (C). L, K. No lean.
- R-31 `lem:pencil-d-good-ear`: the proof split at a core; `def₂(G[X]) = 1` by a partition case
  split, connectivity not through `s(X)`. L, K. No lean.
- R-34 `lem:pencil-d-ear-free`: the trivial lifts embedded by dimension, rank at most three only in
  `U(G)`, (b) by two plane normals. L, K. No lean.
- R-53 `lem:pencil-d-good-ear` (iii): `|X| ≥ 3` from the core (`s(X) ≤ 1` needs the edge `ab`,
  then `hF2`), not "as `G` is simple". L, K. Lean: the recon, L.

**C. A step skipped, added or ordered otherwise** (6). Also the step parts of R-28 and R-35 (under
A) and of R-16 and R-27 (under B).
- R-5 `thm:pencil-d-cycle`, the placement: one path, a closed `N`-gon with `N = min(m, D)`, not two
  cases. L, K. Lean: the coordinator, a toss-up.
- R-12 `thm:pencil-d-open-ear-four`: the factored order (the put-back a hypothesis, discharged
  after). L (state the factoring), K. No lean.
- R-14 `thm:pencil-d-open-ear-three`: no component step and no path lemma; `r ≤ 2` gives
  `dim ρ ≤ 2` by glued-ends or a common member (B). L, K. No lean.
- R-17 `lem:pencil-d-chain-count`: classes of interior bodies and the handshake bound, no edge
  segments (B). L (the `\uses` adds `lem:pencil-x0-sparse-count`), K. No lean.
- R-24 the cases' (T1) (`-lift-pendant`, `-lift-ear`, the pendant triangle): one minor per closed
  hub-neighbourhood, no case analysis of which conditions are new. L, K. No lean.
- R-32 `lem:pencil-d-lift-no-rigid`: no map `g` and no `ℓ₀`; `dim L̃` through the lifting
  system's kernel (B). L, K. No lean.

**Close calls**, `no departure` rows on criterion (3) (a dropped hypothesis judged vacuous,
recovered or the setting), so that the PI may reopen any:
- R-36 `lem:pencil-d-contract-magnified-rank`: the pin takes any `r`, no `r ∈ W`, the setting of
  `def:pencil-contract-lifting-system`, read by no proof.
- R-38 `lem:deficiency-tight-part`: no case `Z = V(G)`, as the pin of the cited
  `lem:separated-partition-value` (`deficiency.tex`, outside the audit) takes neither side nonempty.
- R-44 `lem:pencil-d-chain-count`, `thm:pencil-d-chain-or-core`: no `ℓ ≥ 1`, vacuous for the count
  (its hypotheses contradict at `ℓ = 0`), recovered for the theorem, the setting.
- R-54 `thm:pencil-d-generic`: its proof reads less where a case's pin drops a hypothesis (R-25's
  other neighbour; R-29's `a ≁ b`, passed as `a ≠ b`).

### The B/C judgment (2026-11-05)

The recon the PI asked for at round 1's stop (§1), widened the same day to the argument and step
parts of family A (§1, *the B/C judgment's scope*). Each verdict comes from the node's proof in
`pencil-d.tex` and its pins' statements and bodies at `b9cf3c66` (the Lean unchanged since
`a3b80ac4`), not from the row's text alone. **L**: the chapter's proof and its `\uses` to the
Lean's route; **K**: keep both, round 2 adding a one-sentence formalization remark naming the
Lean's route (as R-22's note); **H**: a Lean helper so that the Lean follows the chapter. "Reads
better" is calibrated on the PI's call of 2026-10-30 (§1): the Lean where it is the shorter
elementary argument (the star, the insertion), the chapter where its argument is the explicit or
the standard one (the affine map, the base triangle). Proposed for the second stop, and **approved
as proposed** by the PI there (2026-11-05, §1); no row's status changes until round 2 applies it.

**The 22 rows of families B and C.**

| Row | Node | Remedy | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-3 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-polygon-normal` (2) | **K** | The map `g(x̄, ω) = (M(x̄ − ω ȳ_i), ω)` is checked at sight; the basis extension and transvection are the API's route (the PI's 2026-10-30 call, the coordinator's K). No H: a `K^d × K` split would re-prove a green lemma. |
| R-4 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-polygons`, the base triangle | **K** | `P_0, …, P_d` a basis, whose joins are a basis of `⋀²`, is the standard one-line reason (the PI's call). H would be cheap (mathlib's `Module.Basis.exteriorPower`, which `CombinatorialRigidity/Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/ExteriorPower/Basis.lean` already uses) but gains the reader nothing. |
| R-9 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-kernel-curve` | **L** | The Lean's contradiction (no `ξ₁` puts `M_w ξ₀` off `range M(y₀)`; a basis of that range with it stays independent at some `t ≠ 0`, inside `range M(y₀ + tw)`, above the generic rank) is one paragraph in the chapter's own tools, a minor nonzero at a point over an infinite `K`, with no `K(t)` or power series, as the PI preferred the Lean's line for the insertion (R-2). |
| R-10 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-ear-data` (3) | **K** | A toss-up: the chapter's `f_α(y(s))` is the coefficient of `λ^α` in the Lean's `h(λ, s)`, so the two proofs take the same polynomial, which the remark says in a sentence. |
| R-11 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-two-stars` (1) | **K** | Extending `y, y'` to a basis is the standard proof of `ker ⋀²π`, and the same basis carries the proof's `⋀^{d−1}` paragraph; the Lean's linear section of the quotient is formalization economy. No H. |
| R-16 (B, C) | `lem:pencil-d-glued-ends` | **K** | The steps agree one for one (`dim Z⁰(q) = 3 + m`, constant on the parts, a connected part, `⋀²π` injective on `ρ`); the merged deficiency is the chapter's name for `def₂(G′)`, equated at once, and the Lean's two-way split of `X` is the `c = 2` case of the chapter's count. |
| R-18 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-base-case` | **K** | The motions give each case's rank exactly, with no upper-bound lemma; the Lean's bounds (a hinge's `D − 1` rows, at most the target) are `lem:pencil-base-case`'s `d = 3` count. Close (below). No H. |
| R-19 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-nonsimple-case` | **L** | The proof says it follows `lem:pencil-nonsimple-case`, after KT Lemma 6.2, whose count is the block-triangular splice (KT eqs. (6.3)–(6.5), `lem:rigidityRows-splice-rank-add`), as the Lean's is at every `D`; L makes that sentence true, and the closing remark's third point becomes "the splice holds at every `D`". No H. |
| R-20 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-nondegenerate-feasible` | **L** | The Lean's rows (a form nonzero at `b_v`, one vanishing on each `Π_w`, each chosen off at most two proper subspaces) replace two paragraphs of quotients, an induction on `dim Σ A_w` and a quadric, over any field. |
| R-21 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-lift-one-witness` | **L** | One polynomial section through the given lift's parameters, with no Cramer basis, no `γ` and no coefficient `P_α`, is shorter, and is how `lem:pencil-d-x0-one-witness` already reads. |
| R-23 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-lift-transfer` | **K** | Nonempty and open as the preimage under the onto restriction is two standard facts composed; the Lean's rank polynomial in `λ` is as short, so a change gains nothing. Close (below). |
| R-26 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-lift-pendant`, `-lift-ear` (T2) | **L** | One form on `K⁴` per body (part (2) of `lem:pencil-d-lift-realization`) makes (T2) a reuse (`ψ_u` at `v`; at the ear, a form with three values at independent points), as the chapter's own (T2) of `lem:pencil-d-lift-cut-edge` already reads; R-29's (T2) follows it. |
| R-27 (B, C) | `lem:pencil-d-lift-small` (1), the triangle | **K** | The partition values give `def_d = 0` outright, which the pendant triangle reuses ("the triangle's being zero"), and the joins' independence is R-4's fact; the Lean's sandwich (rigid, at most the target, `def_d ≥ 0`) is a formalization shortcut. |
| R-31 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-good-ear` | **K** | (iii)'s computations in `s` (`s(X) = s(W₀) + 1`, the singleton bound, `s(X) ≥ 3` when `G[X]` splits) are a line each; the core split and the partition case split factor the same steps for the Lean. |
| R-34 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-ear-free` | **L** | Carrying only rank `≥ 3` in (a), and filling `L̃` by (c) with the trivial lifts and one free coordinate per body, drops the paragraph that checks rank `≤ 3` on `Γ_L`, `Γ(G)` and the configuration, and the count `dim L̃ = dim L + |X|`; the arguments for (b) and the openness may stay. |
| R-53 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-good-ear` (iii), its `\|X\| ≥ 3` | **K** | Minimum degree two in a simple graph forces three bodies, checked on the spot; reading it off `lem:pencil-rigid-good-ear`'s proof sends the reader to another chapter. Against the recon's L lean. |
| R-5 (C) | `thm:pencil-d-cycle`, the placement | **K** | A toss-up (the PI's): the two cases use `lem:pencil-d-polygons` and part (1) of `lem:pencil-d-polygon-collapse` as stated (`m ≥ D`); one path at `N = min(m, D)` would first restate the collapse at every `N ≤ m`. |
| R-12 (C) | `thm:pencil-d-open-ear-four` | **K** | The proof's one order (base data, three conditions, `x₂` put back, the count) reads in one pass; the factoring through `of_openEar_splitOff_of_base` is code shared with the three-body step, whose proof already says "only the first stage and the third condition on the ear data change". |
| R-14 (C, B) | `thm:pencil-d-open-ear-three` | **L** | At `r ≤ 2`, `dim ρ ≤ 2` directly (glued-ends when the closed neighbourhoods of `a`, `b` are disjoint, else `ρ ⊆ span(b_a ∨ b_t, b_t ∨ b_b)` at a common member `t`), so `W`, of dimension `≤ 5 < 2d − 1`, holds no two stars: no contradiction, component step or four-edge path. The factoring stays R-12's. |
| R-17 (C, B) | `lem:pencil-d-chain-count` | **K** | The segments are the classical exact count (`\|E(G)\| = Σ L_j`, `3\|B\| ≤ 2e`); the Lean's classes of interior bodies and the handshake bound reach the same last line by inequalities chosen for the formalization. |
| R-24 (C) | the cases' (T1) | **L** | One minor per closed hub-neighbourhood of `G` (each inside `V(H)`, a removed body being no hub) spares all three cases the sorting of which conditions are new; the old ones are harmless factors. |
| R-32 (C, B) | `lem:pencil-d-lift-no-rigid` | **L** | Only a main picture's minimality is used (`dim L(q) ≤ dim L(q′)`), so Jackson and Jordán's equality and `ℓ₀` leave the proof; the conditions that make the rescaled points a configuration hold generally, witnessed at `r*`, so no map `g`. |

**The 7 argument or step parts of family A rows** (their statements go L, the PI's word). *Forced*:
whether restating the statement to its pin forces the proof's hand.

| Row | Node | Remedy | Forced | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-15 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-planes-meet` | **K** | No: the proof never reads `K` infinite. | The `λ` map through `lem:pencil-lifting-planes-dim`, and `R` a minor of `L(z)` at a height of independent first rows, are the Lean's fixed three-point inverse and its rank openness at that height, in other words. |
| R-25 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-lift-pendant` (T1) | **L** | Yes: without "`u` has another neighbour", the two cases (two neighbours in `H`, or one, `w`) miss `u` alone in `H`. | The Lean's split, `u` a hub of `G` or not, with `b_v` off the span `W` (`dim W ≤ 2`) of the points of `u`'s closed neighbourhood in `H`, is the chapter's two cases, its second covering `u` alone; it also strikes `thm:pencil-d-generic`'s derived clause (R-54). |
| R-28 (C) | `lem:pencil-d-lift-small` (2) | **K** | No: (2)'s proof never reads simplicity. | "The lift space of `G` is the product of those of the sides" is the one-line statement of the Lean's body-by-body glue. |
| R-29 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-lift-pendant-triangle` | **L** (T2), **K** the rest | No: the ear's proof never reads `a ≁ b` (its rank is the ear formula, `ear_rank`). | (T2) as R-26: one form `ψ_c` at `x₁`, `x₂` and `c`, so `Π⁰_{x_i} = Π⁰_c` is not needed; the triangle's rank and deficiency as R-27; (T1) by polarity is the chapter's construction in its notation `Π⁰_v = n_v^⊥`. |
| R-30 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-lift-cut-edge` | **L** | No: the argument never reads `\|V₁\|, \|V₂\| ≥ 2`. | One frame map and one minor (the independence on `u`'s closed hub-neighbourhood in `G`, whose non-roots put `r₁`'s own `n_v ∈ P` off `N`) replace the set `𝒢`, the case analysis on `\|S\|` and the replaced normal of `u`. |
| R-33 (B) | `lem:pencil-d-ear-extend` | **L** | No: neither simplicity nor the selector is read. | One witness per condition replaces the moment curve, and the greedy choice of the `n_u` (each `A_u` of dimension three, or two and missing `m_v` by (b)) replaces the case analysis on `O_v`. |
| R-35 (C) | `lem:pencil-d-agrees-three`, its first sentence | **L** | Yes: without "nonzero", the proof must match the dimension of `def:pencil-d-realization` with the nonzero point of `def:pencil-panel-realization`. | The added sentence, `q^⊥` three-dimensional exactly when `q ≠ 0`, is that match (`finrank_dotPerp`); the `\uses` unchanged. |

**Tally.** The 22: 9 L, 13 K, no H (family B, 16: 6 L, 10 K; family C, 6: 3 L, 3 K). The 7 parts:
4 L, 2 K and R-29 split ((T2) L, the rest K); two of them forced (R-25, R-35). No H anywhere: of the
five rows offered it, R-3, R-4, R-11 and R-18 go K and R-19 L.

**Close calls.** R-18: K, but with R-19 at L the reduction section reads the rank by motions in the
base case and by the splice at parallel edges; L would follow `lem:pencil-base-case`'s `d = 3` count
there too. R-23: both proofs short. R-5 and R-10: the toss-ups, kept as the cheaper remedy. R-53
goes against its recon's L lean.

**Corrections found.** None: each row's *Chapter* and *Lean* text matches the node and its pins'
bodies at HEAD. One reading: R-29's "(T1) is in the polarity form" is the chapter's own construction
in its notation (`Π⁰_v = n_v^⊥`), not a departure. The coordinator, at the second stop: R-19's
reason overstates "makes that sentence true", as the node's closing remark already says its count
of motions departs from the `d = 3` splice; its L stands on consistency with that proof and the
Lean.
