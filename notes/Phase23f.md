# Phase 23f — Case III general `d`: the geometry arm (work log)

**Status:** in progress. The fifth CHAIN-layer sub-phase (CHAIN = 23b + 23c + 23d + 23e + 23f). 23e landed
the KT-faithful A3-transposed rank certificate + its LA scaffolding axiom-clean (`notes/Phase23e.md`); 23f
builds the **geometry arm** that *constructs* the cert's block data, then the chain dispatch + CHAIN-5.
**Phase 23 stays in progress.** Authoritative recon: `notes/Phase23-design.md` §(4.71) ((D-canonical)
feasibility verdict + ordered plan D-CAN-1..4) / §(4.72) (the `hsupp` gate-free discharge); the route history
is §(4.54)→(4.66)→(4.68)→(4.70). Program map: `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`.

## Current state

**ROUTE-α LA CORE LANDED — the corner 3-normal-LI source's linear-algebra half is done; the residual gap is
now ONE localized geometric side-condition.** This session landed `exists_independent_perp_family_escape`
(`Claim612.lean`): the strengthened perp-family lemma whose transversal `n'` escapes the chain plane
`span {q a, q b}` (giving the 3-normal LI the LANDED `chainData_arm_corner_blockBasis_linearIndependent_of_triLI`
consumes) PROVIDED the side-condition `q b ∉ ker (of p)` (`∃ i, p i ⬝ᵥ q b ≠ 0`). The remaining genuinely-new
step (route α next commit) = supply that side-condition (KT general position; the preceding chain panel normal
is not orthogonal to the join's kept points — not a current discriminator output) and thread `_escape` through
`exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen` → `exists_chainData_discriminator_pick` →
`exists_shared_redundancy_and_matched_candidate`. See *Blockers* + *Hand-off*. `d=3` stays fully green.

**D-CAN-4 IN PROGRESS — all FEEDER leaves + the `hA` leaf + its `hAeq` operated-corner identity LANDED.**
Escape **(D-canonical)** (user-picked, design §(4.71)) is the live route: re-key `blockBasisOn` on the
support extensor so the literal-IH-bottom (C) cert builds and the §(4.29) `caseIIICandidate`-override gate
wall dissolves *at its root* (the opaque per-framework `finBasisOfFinrankEq`). The interior-corner cert is
BUILT (D-CAN-1..3b); D-CAN-4 wires the dispatch that constructs the arm's carried obligations from the
landed feeders. The §(4.73.2) seam was a MISDIAGNOSIS (kernel-checked, session #45):
`corner_hA_zero₁₂_of_gate` consumes the discriminator's DIRECT-`q` **NONZERO** gate `ρ₀(F.supportExtensor
e_a) ≠ 0`, NOT the `q∘shiftPerm` **perp** `= 0`; the `hA` leaf
`chainData_arm_corner_hA_of_discriminator_gate` (`Realization.lean`) threads it with NO `shiftPerm`.
**The §(4.73.4) item (2) `hAeq` leaf is now LANDED** as the genuinely-new KT-6.66 operated-corner identity
`submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₁_sub_mul_toBlocks₂₁_eq_coordEquiv` (`Concrete.lean`, A6): the OPERATED corner
block `toBlocks₁₁ − L₀·toBlocks₂₁` of the column-operated edge matrix IS the `coordEquiv` coordinate matrix
of its operated corner-functional family `φ` (corner panel minus the `L₀`-weighted bottom contributions),
provided the dispatch supplies `hφ` (`φ i = blockBasisOn(corner i) − ∑ L₀ • χ`, the KT-6.66 form coupling
the `±r` slot to `ρ₀`). Composes the `_apply_corner`/`_apply_pin_zero` entry bricks; abstract over `L₀`/`φ`
so the dispatch's `Sum.elim blockBasisOn ρ₀ ∘ em₁` slots in. **The CORNER-BLOCK `hA`/`hB`/`L₀` SUB-ASSEMBLY
is now LANDED concretely** (`Concrete.lean`, A6) — the corner half of the spine's obligations, through ONE
explicit `L₀`: the engine `dual_comb_reindex_fiberwise` (the fiberwise `cGv`→`L₀`-row re-key); the corner
`B`-block read `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₂_eq` (every corner row's off-`v` `B`-fill is its `a`-shifted
`hingeRow`); the `hB`/`L₀` factoring `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₂_eq_mul_toBlocks₂₂` (`toBlocks₁₂ =
L₀·toBlocks₂₂` for the EXPLICIT fiberwise `L₀`, given the per-corner-row `hcomb` widening); and the `hA`
bundle `toBlocks₁₁_sub_mul_toBlocks₂₁_row_linearIndependent_of_gate` (`(A − L₀·C).row` LI, composing the
item-(2) `hAeq` identity with `corner_hA_zero₁₂_of_gate`, given the gate + the `hφ`-collapse). These
discharge the spine `chainData_arm_realization_zero₁₂`'s `hA`+`hB` slots through the SAME `L₀`, modulo the
carried `hcomb`/`hφ` (the genuinely-new W6b→corner transport, deferred to the dispatch as hypotheses).
**CORNER `hA` RE-ROUTED off `ρ₀` (§(4.74)/§(4.75), kernel-checked).** The OPERATED `hAeq` path needs
`blockBasisOn(±r slot) = ρ₀` (FALSE — opaque `finBasisOfFinrankEq`); but it is the WRONG path under the
pin-zero `Gab` bottom (`C = toBlocks₂₁ = 0`), where `A − L₀·C = A` and `hA` is **bare `A.row` LI** needing
only block INCOMPARABILITY, NOT the `ρ₀`-identity. Landed this session (`Concrete.lean`, `ρ₀`-free,
axiom-clean): `hingeRowBlock_not_le_of_supportExtensor_not_mem_span` + `exists_corner_blockBasisOn_linearIndependent_of_not_le`.
**The incomparability SOURCE leaf + corner-LI chain (route (a)) LANDED** (this session, axiom-clean): the
panel-meet non-parallelism leaf `panelSupportExtensor_not_mem_span_of_triLI` (`PanelLayer.lean`) + the
spine-binding `chainData_arm_corner_blockBasis_linearIndependent_of_triLI` (`Realization.lean`). These reduce
the corner `hA` to EXACTLY ONE carried genuinely-new input: the direct-`q` 3-normal LI `![q a, n', q b]` — the
LAST genuinely-new corner input, now FLAGGED for adjudication (`n'` is the discriminator transversal, NOT a
`q`-vertex, so the alg-indep triple does NOT apply; the discriminator's contract does not certify `n' ∉ span
{q a, q b}`). Route (b)'s direct-`q` perp is the §(4.73.2) seam (REAL, kernel-confirmed — the landed perp crux
gives the chain-edge panel `(i+1, i)`, NOT the spine's direct-`q` short-circuit panel `(i+1, i-1)`). See
*Blockers* + *Hand-off*. The OPERATED `hAeq` leaves (eeafe64/32808a3/a1e5f9a) are NOT on this path (`C ≠ 0`);
kept in tree. `d=3` stays fully green (hard constraint).

**Landed (all axiom-clean, GATE-FREE, in tree — per-leaf detail in *Lemma checklist* + *Still-live*):**
- **D-CAN-1** the canonical, support-extensor-keyed hinge-block basis + the `blockBasisOn`/`blockBasis` def
  swap + `_congr` lemmas (`Concrete.lean`; type-transparent drop-in, ZERO interface breaks).
- **D-CAN-2** the literal-`Matrix` (C) bottom bridge `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₂₂_eq_Gab` (`Concrete.lean`;
  the PROBE-Q2 transport — `blockBasisOn_congr` firing inside the `hingeRow`/`Pi.single` wrapper — closing the
  §(4.70)-blocked equality in 3 lines).
- **D-CAN-3a** the (C) `hD` leaf `linearIndependent_toBlocks₂₂_row_Gab_of_finrank_eq` + its rank sibling
  `rank_columnOp_toBlocks₂₂_eq_finrank_span_Gab` over the literal IH bottom (`Concrete.lean`; replaces the
  `mixedBottom` `hD` route, same target type, so the §(4.29) gate never forms).
- **D-CAN-3b** the interior-arm spine `chainData_arm_realization_zero₁₂` (`Realization.lean`, after
  `chainData_arm_realization_sep`; fires the `_zero₁₂` cert via `case_III_arm_realization_rowOp`, carrying the
  row-op matrix data + candidate edge-facts + gates + `hends_Gv`/`hne_Gv` as hypotheses for the dispatch — as
  `_sep` does its disjoint-block obligations).
- **D-CAN-4 feeders** (all gate-free): the two cross-framework `hsupp` leaves + the `∀ i` producer
  `caseIIICandidate_hsupp_of_rowClassifier`; the candidate `hgp` producer
  `caseIIICandidate_supportExtensor_ne_zero_of_genPos`; the `Gab` bottom-selection producer
  `bottom_selection_of_crossFramework_span_Gab` (+ feeder `span_range_aShifted_blockBasisOn_eq_rigidityRows`);
  the IH-bottom finrank-count producer `exists_ofNormals_finrank_span_rigidityRows_eq_of_hsplitGP`.
- **route-α LA core** `exists_independent_perp_family_escape` (`Claim612.lean`) — the strengthened
  perp-family lemma (escape `span {n_u, w}` for any `w ∉ ker (of p)`); the engine the strengthened
  discriminator builds the corner transversal through.

**§(4.72) settled the make-or-break gate-free** (the `hsupp` discharge for the real candidate↔IH-`Q` pair, the
crux the §(4.71) plan asserted but did not compiler-verify): both bottom-row kinds discharge via the candidate
override ACCESSORS — off-slot via `caseIIICandidate_supportExtensor_of_ne`; the §(4.65)-feared a-shifted
`e_b`-fill row via `caseIIICandidate_supportExtensor_reproduced` (a `Function.update_self`); the chain relabel
via `ofNormals_supportExtensor_relabel_perm` — never the gate `ρ₀ ⊥̸ C(vᵢ₊₁,n')`, the discriminator, or a span
membership. `q := Q.normal` is the established conflict-free placement (no new dispatch obligation). So the
§(4.29) wall is DISSOLVED, not relocated.

**Route history (settled/dead — full arc in git + design §(4.66)/(4.68)/(4.69)/(4.70)):** the route-(α)
`_aug`/`_rowOp`/chain-arm ladder (αE1–αE5) is landed-but-dead; the three as-scoped escapes (α1)/(α2)/(C) were
all blocked-or-relocate under the *opaque* `blockBasisOn` (§(4.68)–(4.70)); (D-canonical) re-keys the basis on
the support extensor and dissolves that wall. Cert card target unchanged: `card m₁ + card m₂ = D·(|V(G)|−1) ≤
(D−1)·|E(G)|` (an inequality, no isostatic-tightness forced).

## Architectural choices made up front (inherited from 23e / the frozen contract)

- **Cert is consumed, not re-derived.** The 23e cert chain is axiom-clean + SATISFIABLE; 23f only *produces*
  its block data. Build against the literal `Lrow * M * U` product, NOT the component leaves in isolation
  (the §(4.46)/(4.54) lesson — compiler-check the FULL composition before declaring "remaining = assembly").
- **The interior-corner cert is the literal-IH-bottom (C) cert via (D-canonical)** (design §(4.71)); the
  route-(α) `±r`/row-op corner framing is dead-arm (git + design §(4.66)).
- **`d=3` zero-regression via the cert FORK.** `d=3` keeps the `_matrix`/M₃ path; only the general-`d` arm
  routes through `case_III_rank_certification_zero₁₂`. Do NOT unify the two.
- **Below the CHAIN↔ENTRY contract + the motive/IH.** The geometry arm + dispatch are below C.3/C.1 and the
  0-dof motive. The frozen interface (C.0–C.6) + the sanctioned C.3 `hIH` addition stay valid.

## Lemma checklist

**The LIVE forward plan is item (4) — (D-canonical), the D-CAN-1..4 sequence (design §(4.71.4),
kernel-de-risked §(4.71); `hsupp` gate-free §(4.72)).**

**Route-(α) ladder (the former checklist items (i)–(HB)) — LANDED-but-DEAD** (the `_aug`/`_rowOp`
interior-corner strategy D-canonical replaced; settled detail in git + design §(4.66)/(4.68)). **REUSED by
D-canonical** (see *Still-live*): B1/B2, leaf (i) `matrix_eq_mul_of_dual_row_comb`, leaf (iii)
`corner_hA_zero₁₂_of_gate`, BOT-3′, `finScrewDimSplitCorner`, the `_mixedBottom_of_finrank_eq` HD producer,
the free BOT-2, the `_rowOp` wrapper + `_zero₁₂` cert + edge-`_zero₁₂` engine, BOT-1/R1, D1
`interior_hsplitGP`. The αE5 deletion removed only the `(e_b,j₀)`-collision machinery (zero-caller orphans).

  - [~] **D-CAN-4** the dispatch + CHAIN-5 + the C.3 `hIH` one-field add. **IN PROGRESS — all feeders landed:**
    - [x] the cross-framework `hsupp` leaves
      (`caseIIICandidate_supportExtensor_eq_ofNormals_of_ends_eq` off-slot +
      `caseIIICandidate_supportExtensor_reproduced_eq_ofNormals` a-shifted `e_b`-fill) + the assembled `∀ i`

    - [x] the `Gab` bottom-selection producer `bottom_selection_of_crossFramework_span_Gab` + its feeder
      `span_range_aShifted_blockBasisOn_eq_rigidityRows` (`Concrete.lean`) — the

    - [x] the IH-bottom full-rank count `hfr₂` producer
      `exists_ofNormals_finrank_span_rigidityRows_eq_of_hsplitGP` (`Realization.lean`) — the

      GATE-FREE.
    - [x] **the `chainData_dispatch` composition SPIKE** (§(4.73), `SpikeDispatch.lean`, kernel-checked) —
      9/13 obligations compose sorry-free; 4 residuals + 1 placement seam mapped to buildable sub-commits.
    - [x] **the §(4.73.2) placement seam RESOLVED + the `hA` leaf LANDED**
      `chainData_arm_corner_hA_of_discriminator_gate` (`Realization.lean`, after the spine) — the seam was a
      MISDIAGNOSIS (the perp-producer is dead-arm; the corner consumes the direct-`q` NONZERO gate); the `hA`
      leaf is sorry-free modulo the carried `hAeq` (KT 6.66). GATE-FREE, axiom-clean.
    - [x] **the `hAeq` leaf (KT 6.66, §(4.73.4) item (2)) LANDED**
      `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₁_sub_mul_toBlocks₂₁_eq_coordEquiv` (`Concrete.lean`, A6) — the
      operated-corner matrix-entry identity: `toBlocks₁₁ − L₀·toBlocks₂₁ = coordEquiv ∘ φ` for the operated
      corner-functional family `φ` (corner panel `−` `L₀`-weighted bottom; `hφ` carries the KT-6.66 `ρ₀`
      coupling for the dispatch). Composes `_apply_corner`/`_apply_pin_zero`; abstract over `L₀`/`φ`.
      GATE-FREE, axiom-clean.
    - [x] **the CORNER-BLOCK `hA`/`hB`/`L₀` sub-assembly LANDED** (`Concrete.lean`, A6, all axiom-clean,
      GATE-FREE) — the corner half of the spine's obligations through ONE explicit `L₀`:
      - `dual_comb_reindex_fiberwise` (the engine, the fiberwise `cGv`→`L₀`-row re-key; `matrix_eq_mul_of_
        dual_row_comb` refactored to delegate).
      - `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₂_eq` (the corner `B`-block read: every corner row off-`v` reads its
        `a`-shifted `hingeRow`, `_apply_eB_off_pin`; the `e_a` panel rows' `B`-fill is `hingeRow a a · = 0`).
      - `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₂_eq_mul_toBlocks₂₂` (the `hB`/`L₀` factoring: `toBlocks₁₂ =
        L₀·toBlocks₂₂` for the explicit fiberwise `L₀`, given the per-corner-row `hcomb` widening).
      - `toBlocks₁₁_sub_mul_toBlocks₂₁_row_linearIndependent_of_gate` (the `hA` bundle: `(A − L₀·C).row` LI,
        composing the item-(2) `hAeq` identity with `corner_hA_zero₁₂_of_gate`, given the gate + `hφ`).
    - [x] **the NON-`ρ₀` corner-LI core** (the pin-zero-`C` re-route; §(4.75)) —
      `hingeRowBlock_not_le_of_supportExtensor_not_mem_span` (incomparability from support non-parallelism) +
      `exists_corner_blockBasisOn_linearIndependent_of_not_le` (corner family LI from incomparability)
      (`Concrete.lean`, both `ρ₀`-free, axiom-clean). Sidesteps the false `blockBasisOn(±r) = ρ₀`: under the
      pin-zero `Gab` bottom `hA` = bare `A.row` LI via `linearIndependent_toBlocks₁₁_row_of_corner_gate`.
    - [x] **the incomparability SOURCE leaf + the corner-LI chain (route (a), §(4.75.3) RESOLVED)** —
      the panel-meet non-parallelism leaf `panelSupportExtensor_not_mem_span_of_triLI` (`PanelLayer.lean`,
      `C(e_a) ∉ span {C(e_b)}` from the 3-normal LI `![q a, n', q b]`; via
      `normalsJoin_pair_linearIndependent_of_triLI` + `panelSupportExtensor_linearIndependent_iff`) + the
      spine-binding corner-LI chain `chainData_arm_corner_blockBasis_linearIndependent_of_triLI`
      (`Realization.lean`, composing PROBE A + the landed incomparability + corner family LI; the spine's
      direct-`q` candidate/reproduced supports threaded). BOTH axiom-clean, GATE-FREE. **The corner `hA`
      now reduces to exactly ONE carried genuinely-new input: the direct-`q` 3-normal LI `![q a, n', q b]`
      (`n'` off `span {q a, q b}` — KT general position on the panels, NOT a discriminator output as-is).**
      Route (a) chosen over route (b): the spine is direct-`q` (forced by the direct-`q` NONZERO gate), so
      its reproduced panel is the SHORT-CIRCUIT panel `(vtx(i+1), vtx(i-1))` — distinct from the landed perp
      crux's chain-edge panel `(vtx(i+1), vtx i)` (the relabel-`q`-equivalent; §(4.73.2) seam REAL for the
      perp). DECISION FLAGGED — see *Blockers*.
    - [x] **the route-α LA core `exists_independent_perp_family_escape`** (`Claim612.lean`, next to
      `exists_independent_perp_family`) — the strengthened perp-family lemma: with `m ≤ k` kept points,
      `n_u` perp to all + `≠ 0`, AND `w` NOT perp to all (`∃ i, p i ⬝ᵥ w ≠ 0`), produces `n'` perp to
      the kept points, `![n_u, n'] LI`, AND `n' ∉ span {n_u, w}`. The reusable engine the strengthened
      discriminator builds its transversal through (so `n'` escapes the chain plane `span {q a, q b}`,
      `n_u := q a`, `w := q b`). The `W ⊓ ker L = span {n_u}` count: `w ∉ ker L` collapses the
      intersection to 1-dim, proper in the ≥2-dim `ker L`. GATE-FREE, axiom-clean (`propext`,
      `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` only). LANDED this session.
    - [ ] **the 3-normal-LI producer + the `hA` matrix wiring** — (i) feed `exists_independent_perp_family_escape`'s
      `w := fun j => q (cd.vtx (i-1).castSucc, j)` slot through the discriminator
      (`exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen` builds `n'` via `exists_independent_perp_family`
      at `m = k`; swap in `_escape` + thread the `w ∉ ker L` side-condition out through
      `exists_chainData_discriminator_pick` → `exists_shared_redundancy_and_matched_candidate` →
      `htriLI`); **(ii) the REMAINING geometric gap = the side-condition `∃ i, p i ⬝ᵥ q b ≠ 0`** (the
      preceding chain panel normal `q b` is NOT orthogonal to the join's `k` kept points `p` — KT
      general position; genuinely-new, NOT a current discriminator output, see *Blockers*); then (iii)
      wire `hA : (A − L₀·C).row` LI via `linearIndependent_toBlocks₁₁_row_of_corner_gate` + the `C = 0`
      collapse (`rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_submatrix_toBlocks₂₁_eq_zero`) feeding the corner
      family + `re`/`em₁`.
    - [ ] **the rest: wire `chainData_dispatch`** (the `Fin cd.d` router) — `hcomb`/`hB` via span-membership
      (`matrix_eq_mul_of_span_mem`, no `cGv` widening needed) → `re`/`hre` → dispatch shell + CHAIN-5 + the
      C.3 `hIH` add. ~2-3 commits. (The OPERATED `hAeq` leaves eeafe64/32808a3/a1e5f9a are NOT on the pin-zero
      path — they presume `C ≠ 0`; kept in tree for any future `C ≠ 0` consumer.)

  A1–A5c (matrix model + column op + block-additivity backbones `Rank.lean:480/574/622`) + D1
  `interior_hsplitGP` ✓ LANDED and REUSED. The `_aug`/`_matrix`/`_rowOp`/chain dead arms stay landed-but-dead
  (αE6 retire DEFERRED to phase-close).

## Blockers / open questions

- **THE 3-NORMAL-LI SOURCE `![q a, n', q b]` — ROUTE α IN PROGRESS; LA CORE LANDED, the residual gap is now
  ONE geometric side-condition.** Route α (user-adjudicated 2026-06-27, session #45) = strengthen the
  discriminator pick so its transversal `n'` escapes the chain plane `span {q a, q b}`, giving the 3-normal
  LI the LANDED `chainData_arm_corner_blockBasis_linearIndependent_of_triLI` consumes. **The LA core is now
  LANDED** (`exists_independent_perp_family_escape`, `Claim612.lean`): given `m ≤ k` kept points, `n_u` perp
  + `≠ 0`, and `w ∉ ker (of p)` (`∃ i, p i ⬝ᵥ w ≠ 0`), it builds `n'` perp to the kept points, `![n_u, n'] LI`,
  AND `n' ∉ span {n_u, w}` — the drop-in `_escape` upgrade of `exists_independent_perp_family` (which the
  discriminator calls at `m = k` inside `exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen`). **REMAINING — the
  genuine residual gap, now precisely localized:** the side-condition `∃ i, p i ⬝ᵥ q b ≠ 0` — i.e. the
  preceding chain panel normal `q b = q(vtx(i-1))` is NOT orthogonal to the join's `k` kept points `p`. This
  is KT general position (geometrically TRUE) but **not** a current discriminator output: the kept points `p`
  belong to the Claim-6.12 join `q` chosen inside `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen`,
  and `q b` can even be the *omitted base body* `v₁` at `i = 2` (NOT in the discriminator's panel family), so
  no uniform relation between `q b` and `p` is available. The escape lemma DIES if `q b ∈ ker (of p)` (then
  `span {n_u, q b} ⊇ ker`, no `n'` escapes), so the side-condition is load-bearing, not cosmetic. Supplying
  it = a strengthened discriminator GP guarantee or a fresh GP leaf relating `q b` to the join's kept points
  — the next genuinely-new step (no `sorry`; the corner-LI chain carries it as `htriLI`). **The `=ρ₀` /
  route-(b) perp paths stay dead** (the §(4.73.2) relabel mismatch).
- **C.3 `hIH`-on-consume-shape addition — APPROVED** (user-adjudicated 2026-06-26, session #36; lands at
  D-CAN-4/CHAIN-5 with `chainData_dispatch`). The interior arm needs the INTERIOR-split `hsplitGP`
  (`G.splitOff vᵢ …`), derivable only from `hIH` via `splitOff_isMinimalKDof` — D1 `interior_hsplitGP` ✓
  LANDED; the C.3 dispatch consume-shape gets the `hIH` field added when `chainData_dispatch` is wired (a
  one-field addition touching the C.0 producer/consumer/ENTRY lockstep trio, NOT a motive/IH-strength change).
  Context: design §(4.43) *THE ONE INTERFACE OBLIGATION* + §C.3.
- **THE INTERIOR-ARM CORNER — RESOLVED + BUILT via (D-canonical) (D-CAN-1..3b LANDED).** The
  support-extensor-keyed canonical `blockBasisOn` (D-CAN-1) made the cross-framework basis equality provable +
  transportable to the literal `Matrix`-row equality `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₂₂_eq_Gab` (D-CAN-2), so the
  (C) bottom is the literal IH matrix `R(Gab)` full rank (D-CAN-3a's `hD`), the §(4.29) gate never forms, and
  the interior arm `chainData_arm_realization_zero₁₂` (D-CAN-3b) fires the `_zero₁₂` cert. The `hsupp`
  gate-free discharge (§(4.72)) is now a landed D-CAN-4 feeder. Only the `chainData_dispatch` wiring remains.
- **THE §(4.73.2) PLACEMENT SEAM — RESOLVED (no reconciliation needed; the `hA` leaf is LANDED).** The design
  doc's seam was a MISDIAGNOSIS: it cross-wired the dead-arm `_sep` route's perp-producer
  (`interior_hρe₀_of_widening`, `q∘shiftPerm` perp `= 0`) into the live `_zero₁₂` corner leaf, but
  `corner_hA_zero₁₂_of_gate` consumes the **direct-`q` NONZERO** gate the discriminator already outputs. The
  `hA` leaf `chainData_arm_corner_hA_of_discriminator_gate` (`Realization.lean`) threads it sorry-free (modulo
  the carried `hAeq`). See *Decisions made → The §(4.73.2) seam misdiagnosis*.
- **GAP 6** (KT's all-`k` nested IH (6.1) vs the project's 0-dof-only motive) — orthogonal to the cert;
  tracked separately, lands with D-CAN-4/the dispatch.
- **Downstream (23g+):** ENTRY's `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` reshape + floor lift + OD-1, then ASSEMBLY.
  The frozen contract (C.5/C.6) is invariant; none touches 23e's cert. ENTRY is parallel-safe.

## Hand-off / next phase

**The corner `hA` is now reduced to EXACTLY ONE carried genuinely-new input: the direct-`q` 3-normal LI
`![q a, n', q b]`.** Everything downstream of it composes SORRY-FREE on the spine's exact candidate binding
(PROBE A + PROBE B, kernel-checked, productionized + banked this session): `3-normal LI → non-parallelism
→ incomparability → corner block-basis family LI`. LANDED axiom-clean, gate-free:
- `panelSupportExtensor_not_mem_span_of_triLI` (`PanelLayer.lean`) — the panel-meet non-parallelism leaf
  `C(e_a) = panelSupportExtensor n_v n' ∉ span {panelSupportExtensor n_v n_b} = C(e_b)` from the 3-normal LI
  `![n_v, n', n_b]`, via `normalsJoin_pair_linearIndependent_of_triLI` + `panelSupportExtensor_linearIndependent_iff`.
- `chainData_arm_corner_blockBasis_linearIndependent_of_triLI` (`Realization.lean`) — the spine-binding
  corner-LI chain: from the direct-`q` 3-normal LI it threads the candidate-slot support
  `C(e_a) = panelSupportExtensor (q a) n'` + the reproduced-slot t=0 support `C(e_b) = panelSupportExtensor
  (q a) (q b)` into the panel-meet leaf → `hingeRowBlock_not_le_of_supportExtensor_not_mem_span`
  → `exists_corner_blockBasisOn_linearIndependent_of_not_le`.

**ROUTE (a) chosen; route (b) is the §(4.73.2) seam (REAL, kernel-confirmed).** The spine
`chainData_arm_realization_zero₁₂` is **direct-`q`** (forced by the discriminator's direct-`q` NONZERO gate
`ρ₀(panelSupportExtensor (q(candidateVtx i)) n') ≠ 0` the corner `hA` consumes). So `e_b`'s reproduced panel
is the direct-`q` SHORT-CIRCUIT panel `(vtx(i+1), vtx(i-1))` — NOT the chain-edge panel `(vtx(i+1), vtx i)`.
The landed perp crux `baseRedundancy_perp_interior_reproduced_panel` produces the perp at the chain-edge panel
`(vtx(i+1), vtx i)` (the relabel-`q`-equivalent reproduced panel, via `reproduced_panel_eq_splice_panel`);
`interior_group_acolumn_eq_neg_baseRedundancy` reads the `edge i`-group's `vtx i` column = `−ρ₀` ⟹ perp at
`edge i`'s panel. **No single application of the landed crux gives the direct-`q` short-circuit panel
`(i+1, i-1)`** (at index `i-1` it gives `(i, i-1)`; at `i` it gives `(i+1, i)`). So route (b)'s direct-`q`
perp `ρ₀(C(e_b)) = 0` is genuinely NOT landed — it IS the §(4.73.2) seam (REAL for the perp gate). Route (a)
sidesteps the seam entirely.

**ROUTE α LA CORE LANDED this session** — `exists_independent_perp_family_escape` (`Claim612.lean`, beside
`exists_independent_perp_family`): the discriminator's transversal escapes the chain plane `span {q a, q b}`
PROVIDED the side-condition `q b ∉ ker (of p)` (`∃ i, p i ⬝ᵥ q b ≠ 0`). GATE-FREE, axiom-clean. So the LA
half of route α's strengthened discriminator is done; the strengthened pick wires this in.

**Next commit = the geometric side-condition `∃ i, p i ⬝ᵥ q b ≠ 0` + thread `_escape` through the
discriminator.** (1) Swap `exists_independent_perp_family` → `exists_independent_perp_family_escape` inside
`exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen`'s `n'`-builder (the `m = k` "single shared panel" case, and the
two-panel case where `n' = n w`), feeding `w := q b`'s normal; thread the new `n' ∉ span {n_u, w}` clause out
through `exists_chainData_discriminator_pick` → `exists_shared_redundancy_and_matched_candidate` → the
`htriLI` slot the LANDED `chainData_arm_corner_blockBasis_linearIndependent_of_triLI` consumes. **(2) THE
RESIDUAL GAP = supply the side-condition `∃ i, p i ⬝ᵥ q b ≠ 0`** — the preceding chain panel normal `q b` is
not orthogonal to the join's `k` kept points. This is KT general position (geometrically TRUE) but **not a
current discriminator output** (the kept points belong to the Claim-6.12 join; `q b` can be the omitted base
body `v₁` at `i = 2`). Needs a strengthened GP guarantee in `exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen` /
`exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals_gen`, or a fresh GP leaf — the next genuinely-new step. (Below the
frozen C.0–C.6 contract; additive — the dispatch is unbuilt. β/route-(b) perp was rejected: dead §(4.73.2)
relabel mismatch.) (3) Wire `hA :
(A − L₀·C).row` LI via `linearIndependent_toBlocks₁₁_row_of_corner_gate` + the `C = 0` collapse
(`rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_submatrix_toBlocks₂₁_eq_zero`, from the Gab bottom both-endpoints-≠v) feeding
the corner family (the `_of_triLI` leaf's output) reindexed by the dispatch's `re`/`em₁`. The `hcomb`/`hB` side
composes independently via span-membership (`matrix_eq_mul_of_span_mem`); the OPERATED `hAeq` corner leaves
(eeafe64/32808a3/a1e5f9a) are NOT on this pin-zero path (`C ≠ 0`).

---

*(Superseded plan — the corner-block sub-assembly that the §(4.74) spike found rests on the unsatisfiable
`hAeq`; kept for the reusable engine + `hB`-block reads.)* The corner-block `hA`/`hB`/`L₀` SUB-ASSEMBLY is now LANDED
(`Concrete.lean` A6, all axiom-clean) — `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₂_eq` (the corner `B`-read),
`submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₂_eq_mul_toBlocks₂₂` (the `hB`/`L₀` factoring with the EXPLICIT fiberwise `L₀`
off the engine `dual_comb_reindex_fiberwise`), and `toBlocks₁₁_sub_mul_toBlocks₂₁_row_linearIndependent_of_
gate` (the `hA` bundle composing the `hAeq` identity + `corner_hA_zero₁₂_of_gate`). These discharge the spine
`chainData_arm_realization_zero₁₂`'s `hA`+`hB` slots through the SAME `L₀` (the §(4.64.A) shared-`?L₀`), each
taking the genuinely-new transport as a hypothesis:
- the `hB` leaf takes the per-corner-row `hcomb : φ i = ∑ⱼ cGv i j • χ (μ i j)` (the corner `B`-functionals
  as `cGv`-combinations of the bottom `D`-functionals);
- the `hA` leaf takes the `hφ`-collapse `Sum.elim blockBasisOn ρ₀ ∘ em₁ = blockBasisOn(corner) − ∑ L₀ • χ`.

**What the next commit builds = the PRODUCER of those two hypotheses at the dispatch binding:** transport the
W6b widening `hingeRow a b ρ₀ = ∑ⱼ cGv j • hingeRow(…)` (the discriminator's `hedgeGv` bundle) to the corner
`±r`-row's `hcomb` (the `e_a` panel rows take the trivial `cGv = 0` since their `B`-fill is `hingeRow a a · =
0`), and prove the (3b) `±r`-collapse `ρ₀ = blockBasisOn(±r) − ∑ L₀ • χ` for the SAME explicit `L₀`. The
crux: the `±r` corner functional is `hingeRow a b (blockBasisOn(±r slot))`, and the cert's reproduced `±r`
slot is built so `blockBasisOn(±r slot) = ρ₀` (the `t=0` reproduced slot) — that identification is the
remaining genuinely-new step. The §(4.73.4) build order remaining: (3)+(3b) the `hcomb`/`hφ` producer; (4)
the `re`/`hre` `Sum.elim` builder; (5) the dispatch shell (`Fin cd.d` router) + CHAIN-5 + the C.3 `hIH` add.

**The obligation→feeder wiring (the build plan after the spike; §(4.72.3) + §(4.43)):** the `Fin cd.d` router:
base/`d=3` → the landed `chainData_split_realization`; interior `2 ≤ i` → D-CAN-3b's
`chainData_arm_realization_zero₁₂`. Per-obligation:
- **`hgp`** from `caseIIICandidate_supportExtensor_ne_zero_of_genPos`: `hgppair` = the IH `Q`'s panel general
  position (every distinct pair LI; from `Q.IsGeneralPosition` via `ofNormals_normal`, the `hgp_split a b`
  pattern at `chainData_split_realization:1184`); `hends` = the candidate `ends`-override's link record +
  `heab`/`hLn`/`hgab` from the `cd`-accessors + the discriminator's transversal `n'`.
- **the bottom `re`/`hre`/`hD`** via `bottom_selection_of_crossFramework_span_Gab`: build `lift` (KT's (6.62)
  row map — surviving `Gv`-edge → same `Gab`-edge via `hle`; the a-shifted `e_b`-fill → the fresh `e₀` via
  `he₀ab`), `hlift_ends`/`hlift_supp` (recorded-endpoint + support agreement off the candidate `ends`-override
  + `caseIIICandidate_supportExtensor_of_ne`/`_reproduced`, with the relabel
  `ofNormals_supportExtensor_relabel_perm`), and the bottom seed `q`/GP/link-record/`hfr₂` from
  `exists_ofNormals_finrank_span_rigidityRows_eq_of_hsplitGP` (at the interior `interior_hsplitGP` split,
  def-0); the producer returns `reInr`/`re₂`/`hbot2`/`hbot1`/`hj`/`hsupp`/`hrank`, then `Sum.elim` `reInr`
  with the corner injection's `m₁`-half to form `re`/`hre`, and fire D-CAN-3a's `hD`
  (`linearIndependent_toBlocks₂₂_row_Gab_of_finrank_eq`).
- **the corner `hA`** via leaf (iii) `corner_hA_zero₁₂_of_gate` (the gate's ONE legitimate use, the corner
  `Mᵢ` row, fed the discriminator gate); **`hB`/`hM'eq`** via leaf (i)/BOT-3′ + the operated-entry bricks;
  the corner `L₀` the row-op weight; `hne_Gv` from the candidate GP; the placement `q := Q.normal` (the
  established pattern, d=3 `hQeq` `:303`; general-`d` `chainData_split_realization` `:907`).
- Then **CHAIN-5** + the **C.3 `hIH`** one-field add (§(4.43); D1 `interior_hsplitGP` `Realization.lean:758`
  consumes it for the interior `hsplitGP`). **Gate:** full `lake build` green + `lake lint` clean + axiom-clean.

**Still-live / reusable (in tree, axiom-clean) — all REUSED by the D-CAN plan:** A1–A5c (the matrix model +
column op `U` `Concrete.lean:1259/1274` + block-additivity backbones `Rank.lean:480/574/622`); D1
`interior_hsplitGP` (`Realization.lean:758`, the IH full-rank `R(Gab)`); the discriminator
`exists_shared_redundancy_and_matched_candidate` (`Realization.lean:1481`, the moving-member pick + gates
`hperp` `:1511` / `hρe₀` `:1535`); the realization tail `case_III_realization_of_rank` (`Arms.lean:63`,
consumes only `hrank`, W6e input unchanged by the bottom shape); the D-CAN landings —
`submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₂₂_eq_Gab` (D-CAN-2), `linearIndependent_toBlocks₂₂_row_Gab_of_finrank_eq` +
`rank_columnOp_toBlocks₂₂_eq_finrank_span_Gab` (D-CAN-3a), `chainData_arm_realization_zero₁₂` (D-CAN-3b),
the `hsupp`/`hgp`/`Gab`-bottom/`hfr₂` feeders + the `hA` leaf `chainData_arm_corner_hA_of_discriminator_gate`
+ the `hAeq` leaf `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₁_sub_mul_toBlocks₂₁_eq_coordEquiv` + the corner-block
`hA`/`hB`/`L₀` sub-assembly (`dual_comb_reindex_fiberwise`, `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₂_eq`,
`submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₂_eq_mul_toBlocks₂₂`, `toBlocks₁₁_sub_mul_toBlocks₂₁_row_linearIndependent_of_gate`)
(D-CAN-4, listed in *Lemma checklist*); the support-extensor
agreement `caseIIICandidate_supportExtensor_of_ne`/`_reproduced` (`Candidate.lean`); the row-op matrix-data
arm `case_III_arm_realization_rowOp` (`ForkedArm.lean:315`, LIVE — D-CAN-3b calls it; builds
`Lrow`/`U`/`hblock`/`hrank` in-body via B1/B2 + the `_zero₁₂` cert + the SHARED tail) + its
leaf (iii)/leaf (i)/BOT-3′/B1/B2 row-op apparatus.
**Landed-but-dead-arm** (none used by D-CAN; αE6 retire DEFERRED to phase-close): the `_aug` ladder (αE1–αE4),
`_matrix`, the dual-space chain arm + LEAF-B2.

On D-CAN-4 wiring the dispatch, the CHAIN layer closes and ENTRY (**23g**) opens; ASSEMBLY is **23h**.

## Decisions made during this phase

### Phase-local choices and proof techniques

**(route α — the corner 3-normal-LI source; user-adjudicated 2026-06-27.)**
- **The route-α LA core is a dimension-count escape lemma `exists_independent_perp_family_escape`
  (`Claim612.lean`), and it pins the residual gap to ONE side-condition.** The strengthened
  `exists_independent_perp_family`: the common perp `ker (of p)` has `finrank ≥ 2`, contains `n_u`, and meets
  `span {n_u, w}` in EXACTLY `span {n_u}` whenever `w ∉ ker (of p)` (any `a•n_u + b•w ∈ ker` forces `b = 0`),
  so the inf is proper in `ker` and `SetLike.exists_of_lt` hands over `n' ∈ ker \ span {n_u, w}`. The
  `w ∉ ker` side-condition is **load-bearing** (without it `span {n_u, w} ⊇ ker` can hold and no `n'`
  escapes), so route α's residual = the geometric `q b ∉ ker (of p)` = "the preceding chain panel normal is
  not orthogonal to the join's kept points" (KT general position; not a current discriminator output, *not*
  cosmetic). Compiler-de-risked via a deleted spike before landing (the §(4.62) compiler-check rule). The
  initial `m + 1 ≤ k` headroom variant was REJECTED — there are exactly `m = k` kept points, no headroom, so
  the side-condition route is the only feasible one. GATE-FREE, axiom-clean.

**(D-canonical — the live route; design §(4.71)/(4.72) carry the recon detail.)**
- **The corner `hA` does NOT need `blockBasisOn(±r) = ρ₀` — it needs block INCOMPARABILITY** (§(4.74)/§(4.75),
  kernel-checked). Under the pin-zero `Gab` bottom (both endpoints `≠ v` ⟹ `C = toBlocks₂₁ = 0`) the operated
  corner `A − L₀·C = A`, so `hA` = bare `A.row` LI = corner block-basis family `[blockBasisOn(e_a,·);
  blockBasisOn(e_b,j₀)]` LI, which holds iff some `e_b`-block vector escapes `e_a`'s block — i.e.
  `¬ hingeRowBlock e_b ≤ hingeRowBlock e_a`. The opaque-basis dead-end (`blockBasisOn(±r) = ρ₀`, FALSE since
  `blockBasisOn = finBasisOfFinrankEq`) is on the OPERATED (`C ≠ 0`) path only; it is sidestepped here. Landed
  `ρ₀`-free: `hingeRowBlock_not_le_of_supportExtensor_not_mem_span` (incomparability from support non-parallelism
  `C(e_a) ∉ span {C(e_b)}`, via dual-annihilator order-reversal + `Subspace.dualAnnihilator_dualCoannihilator_eq`)
  + `exists_corner_blockBasisOn_linearIndependent_of_not_le` (corner family LI from incomparability; the escape
  half of `exists_corner_blockBasisOn_linearIndependent` minus the `ρ₀`-construction). Remaining = the
  incomparability SOURCE (a panel-meet non-parallelism leaf, or the direct-`q` perp — see *Hand-off*).
- **The corner-block `hA`/`hB`/`L₀` sub-assembly (KT 6.66, §(4.73.4) items (2)+(3)+(3b)) discharges the
  spine's `hA`+`hB` through ONE explicit `L₀`** (`Concrete.lean` A6). The engine
  `dual_comb_reindex_fiberwise` re-keys `ψ = ∑ⱼ c j • χ (μ j)` to `ψ = ∑ᵢ' (∑ⱼ ∈ {μ ·=i'} c j) • χ i'`
  (`Finset.sum_smul` + per-fiber `χ i' = χ (μ j)` + `← Finset.sum_fiberwise`; generic in the module `N`),
  naming the fiberwise weight `matrix_eq_mul_of_dual_row_comb` inlined (refactored to delegate). The corner
  `B`-read `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₂_eq` (uniform `_apply_eB_off_pin`: every corner row's off-`v` fill
  is its `a`-shifted `hingeRow`, the `e_a` rows giving `hingeRow a a · = 0`) + the `hB` factoring
  `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₂_eq_mul_toBlocks₂₂` (= the two `toBlocks` reads composed with the engine at
  `cols x := (↑x.1, x.2)`) produce the EXPLICIT fiberwise `L₀`; the `hA` bundle
  `toBlocks₁₁_sub_mul_toBlocks₂₁_row_linearIndependent_of_gate` composes the item-(2) `hAeq` identity with
  `corner_hA_zero₁₂_of_gate`. Each carries the genuinely-new W6b→corner transport (`hcomb`/`hφ`) as a
  hypothesis (the dispatch's next producer). The `cols`-lambda binder needs a type ascription → FRICTION.
- **The `hAeq` leaf (KT 6.66, §(4.73.4) item (2)) is a `Concrete.lean`-level matrix-entry identity,
  abstract over `L₀`/`φ`.** `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₁₁_sub_mul_toBlocks₂₁_eq_coordEquiv`: the operated
  corner block `toBlocks₁₁ − L₀·toBlocks₂₁ = coordEquiv ∘ φ`. Per-entry: corner pin read via
  `_apply_corner` (`hc1`/`hc2`); bottom pin read via `_apply_corner`-if-`fst=v`-else-`_apply_pin_zero` (`hb`),
  collapsed into the per-bottom-row `χ`; the caller's `hφ` (`φ i = blockBasisOn(corner) − ∑ L₀ • χ`) gives the
  operated functional. Closing tactic: `congr 1` matches `L₀ i x * φ(c)` (matrix `mul_apply`) with
  `(L₀ i x • φ)(c)` (`LinearMap.sum/smul_apply`) by `smul_eq_mul` defeq — no explicit rewrite. Abstracting
  over `φ` (not hardcoding `Sum.elim ρ₀`) lets the dispatch's `Sum.elim blockBasisOn ρ₀ ∘ em₁` slot directly
  into `corner_hA_zero₁₂_of_gate`'s `hAeq`; the `±r`-slot `φ = ρ₀` proof is the dispatch's D4 (off W6b).
- **The §(4.73.2) seam misdiagnosis — the `hA` corner consumes the direct-`q` NONZERO gate, NOT a perp; no
  `shiftPerm` reconciliation.** `corner_hA_zero₁₂_of_gate` (`Concrete.lean:757`) takes `hρe₀ : ρ₀
  (F.supportExtensor e_a) ≠ 0`; the discriminator outputs exactly that at the matched candidate against direct
  `q` (`candidateVtx i = vtx i.succ`, `supportExtensor (edge i) = panelSupportExtensor (q(vtx i.succ,·)) n'`).
  `interior_hρe₀_of_widening`'s `q∘shiftPerm` perp `= 0` feeds the dead-arm `case_III_arm_corner_assembly`
  (`_sep`) route only — the `_zero₁₂` chain never consumes an `hρe₀`. Landed leaf:
  `chainData_arm_corner_hA_of_discriminator_gate` (`Realization.lean`, after the spine), sorry-free modulo the
  carried `hAeq`. (session #45, kernel-checked.)
- **(D-canonical) = re-key `blockBasisOn` on the support extensor, making the literal-IH-bottom (C) cert
  buildable.** D-CAN-1 `canonBlock`/`canonBlockBasis`/`_congr` + the `blockBasisOn`/`blockBasis` drop-in (the
  re-keying); D-CAN-2 `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₂₂_eq_Gab` (the literal-`Matrix` bottom equality, the
  PROBE-Q2 `_congr`-fires-inside-`Matrix.of` transport); D-CAN-3a the `hD` over the literal IH bottom (replaces
  `mixedBottom`); D-CAN-3b the arm spine firing the `_zero₁₂` cert. The wall §(4.70) found ((C) relocates it
  under the *opaque* basis) DISSOLVES under the re-keying — the cross-framework basis equality is provable AND
  transports to the literal `Matrix` equality (§(4.71) PROBE 2a/Q2, kernel-checked).
- **The D-CAN-4 feeders are all GATE-FREE** (§(4.72), kernel-checked): `hsupp` (candidate↔IH-`Q` support
  agreement) discharges via the override accessors (`_of_ne` off-slot; `_reproduced` for the §(4.65)-feared
  `e_b`-fill row — a `Function.update_self`), not the gate; `hgp` via per-edge slot classification; the `Gab`
  bottom selection via the literal-IH-bottom route (`bottom_selection_of_crossFramework_span_Gab`, lifting
  selected `F₂ = R(Gab)` rows to `F`-rows by a per-edge `lift`); `hfr₂` via the IH `hsplitGP` finrank count
  (`exists_ofNormals_finrank_span_rigidityRows_eq_of_hsplitGP`, the `ℤ→ℕ` cast via `def=0` + nonempty,
  TACTICS-QUIRKS §47). `q := Q.normal` is the established conflict-free placement.
- **D1 `interior_hsplitGP`** = the `Arms.lean:894` chain-arm precedent at the split-off graph, taking the
  all-`k` `(k':ℤ)`+`Nonempty` `hIH` (`splitOff_isMinimalKDof` + `splitOff_simple_of_noRigid_of_card` +
  `splitOff_vertexSet_ncard_lt`, then IH GP `.1`). Consumes the C.3 `hIH` add. (`splitOff` adds `e₀` so ⊄ `G`;
  simplicity needs `4 ≤ |V|` for a proper triangle — D1 takes `hV4`.)

**Route-(α) αE ladder + bottom-arc — SETTLED/DEAD (verdicts only; full blow-by-blow in git + design
§(4.66)/(4.68)/(4.69)/(4.70)):** αE1–αE4 = the `rigidityMatrixEdgeAug` engine/cert/wrapper ladder
(landed-but-dead); αE5 = the `(e_b,j₀)`-collision-machinery deletion (KEPT B1/B2/BOT-3′/leaf(i)/(iii)/
`_mixedBottom`/free-BOT-2/`_rowOp`/`_zero₁₂` — all REUSED by D-canonical, zero-caller orphans deleted); HD,
BOT-1 = route-(α) landings reused. The αD interior-corner arc (§(4.67)/(4.68)) compiler-confirmed BOTH
candidate arms blocked by the same `caseIIICandidate`-override gate → the §(4.69)–(4.72) recon arc re-routed to
(D-canonical).

### Promoted to FRICTION / TACTICS-QUIRKS / DESIGN
- **The §(4.62) durable lesson — route-composition satisfiability must be COMPILER-CHECKED, not prose-argued**
  (the deferred-hypothesis-satisfiability trap; fired at §(4.62)/(4.65)/(4.66.F)/(4.70), and the recon-before-
  build rule that caught the D-CAN-2 `hsupp` deferral at §(4.72)). → FRICTION; DESIGN.md *Constructibility
  recon*.
- **`set`-folding a carried hypothesis's heavy type breaks the downstream `exact`/whnf match** → TACTICS-QUIRKS
  § 43 (lemma-application variant). **`ℤ→ℕ` cast-subtraction (`push_cast`/`ring` leaves a `.pred`)** → the
  explicit `Nat.cast_mul`/`Nat.cast_sub` route, TACTICS-QUIRKS §47.
- **A projecting argument-lambda (`fun x => (↑x.1, x.2)`) fed to an implicit-domain parameter needs a binder
  type ascription** (the `cols` arg of `matrix_eq_mul_of_dual_row_comb`) → FRICTION *[idiom] Feeding
  `matrix_eq_mul_of_dual_row_comb`'s `cols` …*.
