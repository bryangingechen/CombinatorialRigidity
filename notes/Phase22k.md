# Phase 22k — completing the honest all-`k` Theorem 5.5 (Case III, spine) + Thm 5.6 `d=3` (work log)

**Status:** in progress (opened 2026-06-15 at the 22j close).

22k completes the honest all-`k` Theorem 5.5 the 22i→22j→22k arc set up: the three remaining
22h carries (`h622`, `h65`, `hsplit`) + Theorem 5.6 at `d = 3`. 22i delivered the all-`k`
genuine-hinge motive + the reduction-case producers (L0–L6, `hbase`/`hcontract` discharged);
22j landed the shared span-transport "pinned placement" rank brick
(`le_finrank_span_rigidityRows_of_pinned_placement` = **Brick A**, design §1.68) that **22k's
Case III consumes**. The design basis is the **L7–L10 layer plan + the §1.56 carries table**,
archived in `notes/Phase22i.md` *Hand-off / next phase* + its *Layer plan* / *carries table*
sections; this note transcribes them, with the carries-table "Lean consumption site" column
**re-located into the post-22j-perf 5-file chain** (`GenericityDevice ← Coupling ← CaseI ←
CaseII ← CaseIII ← Theorem55`, under `Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/`).

Structural-edit mode: no new blueprint chapter; the existing `algebraic-induction/*` chapters
restate per slice (the statement-grep gate, `CLAUDE.md` *Structural-edit phases*). The motive
design is canonical in `notes/Phase22-realization-design.md` §1.56 — point at it, don't duplicate.

## Current state

**L7 complete (L7a + L7b + extraction). Next: L8 — the Lemma-6.5 arm.** The `h622` carry is
discharged: `case_III_realization` carries the all-`k` IH and fills the `h622lb` slot of
`case_III_candidate_dispatch` via the standalone `case_III_nested_rank_lower` (extracted so the
node pins to a real decl). `theorem_55_d3` calls the thin wrapper `case_III_realization_0dof`
(Flag F1) until L9 swaps the spine. `lem:case-III-nested-rank-lower` green-and-pinned (to
`case_III_nested_rank_lower`); `lem:case-III` / `thm:theorem-55-d3-instance` restated.
`lake build` + `lake lint` + `blueprint/verify.sh` clean. **L8–L10 open.**

## Layer plan (L7–L10; each layer opens with its own §1.69+ signature pin)

Transcribed from `notes/Phase22i.md` *Layer plan* (the L7–L10 entries) + the §1.56 carries table
+ §1.67. The 22i layers L0–L6 are closed (archived in `notes/Phase22i.md`); 22k is L7–L10.

- [x] **L7** ✓ — the Case-III rewire: `case_III_realization` restated, `h622` *derived* from the
  all-`k` IH (V8) — `h622` carry discharged. **L7a ✓** `exists_rankPolynomial_of_IH_linking` +
  `finrank_span_rigidityRows_ofNormals_eq`. **L7b ✓** `case_III_realization` restate + `h622lb`
  discharge + thin wrapper `case_III_realization_0dof` (Flag F1); discharge then **extracted** as
  the standalone `case_III_nested_rank_lower` so the node pins to a real decl. Blueprint nodes:
  `lem:case-III-nested-rank-lower` (green-and-pinned), `lem:case-III` / `thm:theorem-55-d3-instance` (restated).
- [ ] **L8** — the Lemma-6.5 arm: KT Claim 6.6 graph side (~2–3 commits) + the Π°-placement
  producer (own signature pin first) — `h65` carry discharged. §1.54(a3) steps 1–2; the dispatch
  itself landed in 22h/L5b-iii. Claim 6.6 concludes inside the `k = 0` stratum, **no all-`k`
  generality needed**. Target node: `lem:case-I-dispatch` (flip red→green; flip `\leanok`).
- [ ] **L9** — the zero-carry spine + instance: `theorem_55_all_k`, `theorem_55_d3` restated with
  **zero carries** (`hsplit` discharged here by wiring — G0 `simple_of_isMinimalKDof_of_noRigid`
  gives `G.Simple`, then forgetful M4 ∘ the GP Case-III producer; no new build), `theorem_55`
  deleted/re-pinned, blueprint spine restates. Target nodes: `thm:theorem-55` (flip red→green),
  `thm:theorem-55-d3-instance` (drop the carried family).
- [ ] **L10** — Theorem 5.6 at `d = 3`: the deficiency-preserving spanning-strip brick +
  re-add edges (rank only grows) + the `def > 0` `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` feed (V9: the
  homogeneous projective move). The `def = 0` feed already landed in 22h (the
  `thm:theorem-55-d3-instance` spanning-stratum corollary, `rankHypothesis_deficiency_of_theorem_55_d3`).
  Target node: `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` (currently red — drop the `\uses{thm:theorem-55}`
  dependency on red, flip to green once the spanning-strip + `def>0` feed lands) + a new Thm-5.6
  `d=3` node.

**Beyond the carries**, the all-`k` restructure adds the structural deliverables of §1.56(c)/(e)
— but those (the new reduction cases, the motive restate of every producer) landed in 22i; 22k's
new structural work is only the Thm-5.6 `d=3` push (L10).

## The carries table (relocated to the post-22j-perf 5-file chain)

The §1.55(b) structural fix for orphaned deferrals. **Lean consumption sites re-located** from
the stale `CaseI.lean:6750/:6817/…` refs of `notes/Phase22i.md` into the new
`Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/` chain (the 22j-perf round split the 10,346-line `CaseI.lean`
monolith into `GenericityDevice ← Coupling ← CaseI ← CaseII ← CaseIII ← Theorem55`; rename-free,
so the decl names are unchanged — only the file:line moved).

| Carry | Blueprint red node | Lean consumption site (post-22j-perf chain) | Discharge sub-plan (§1.56) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `h622` (KT eq. (6.22), the nested-IH rank lower bound at the `k'`-dof `G_v`) | `lem:case-III-nested-rank-lower` (case-iii.tex) | **DISCHARGED (22k L7)**: `case_III_realization` carries the all-`k` IH; the `h622lb` slot is filled by the standalone `case_III_nested_rank_lower`; `theorem_55_d3` calls thin wrapper `case_III_realization_0dof` (Flag F1). `lem:case-III-nested-rank-lower` green-and-pinned. | **L7 complete** (22k): all-`k` IH at `G_v` → `exists_rankPolynomial_of_IH_linking` → footnote-6 non-root → arithmetic; discharge extracted as `case_III_nested_rank_lower`. |
| `h65` (the KT Lemma-6.5 vertex-removal arm of the Case-I dispatch) | `lem:case-I-dispatch` (case-i.tex) | signature hyp of `theorem_55_d3` (`Theorem55.lean:516`), the negative branch of the L5c′ `by_cases` (`Theorem55.lean:553`); the dispatch `case_I_dispatch` itself at `Theorem55.lean:1863` (its own `h65` hyp at `:1865`, consumed `:1891`) | **L8**: §1.54(a3) steps 1–2 — Claim 6.6 graph side (~2–3 commits) + the Π°-placement producer (own signature pin first); the dispatch itself landed in 22h/L5b-iii. Claim 6.6 concludes inside the `k = 0` stratum, no all-`k` generality needed |
| `hbase` (the bare two-vertex base) | `def:genuine-hinge-realization` + `def:rank-hypothesis`; `lem:theorem-55-base-producer` green at the strong pair | **DISCHARGED (22i L3)**: `theorem_55_base_producer` (`Theorem55.lean:436`) supplies `.2`; `hbase` dropped from the `theorem_55_d3` signature (`Theorem55.lean:498` comment) | **L3 complete** (22i): the producer concludes the §1.60(a) strong pair `(G.Simple → HasGenericFullRankRealization) ∧ HasPanelRealization` |
| `hsplit` (the bare no-rigid-subgraph branch) | `def:genuine-hinge-realization` (via `lem:case-III`) | signature hyp of `theorem_55_d3` (`Theorem55.lean:489`); the `hsplitGP` wiring threads `case_III_realization` at `Theorem55.lean:541` | **L9 wiring, no new build**: G0 (`simple_of_isMinimalKDof_of_noRigid`) gives `G.Simple`; forgetful (M4) ∘ the GP Case-III producer |
| `hcontract` (the bare Case-I branch) | `def:genuine-hinge-realization` | **DISCHARGED (22i L5)**: signature hyp of `theorem_55_d3` (`Theorem55.lean:494`) now wired through the `by_cases G.Simple` dispatch `case_I_dispatch` (`Theorem55.lean:1863`) → non-simple `case_I_realization_nonsimple` / simple `case_I_realization_all_k`; the negative-contraction sub-arm stays `h65` → L8 | **L5 complete** (22i) — split by motive; the 6.5 sub-arm stays `h65` → L8 |

## Blockers / open questions

- **L7 done; L8–L10 open.** V9 (L10, the `def>0` homogeneous projective move for Thm 5.6 `d=3`)
  still gates to its layer's design pass (carried over from `notes/Phase22i.md` *Blockers*).
- **`lem:case-I-dispatch` prose staleness** (NOT a gate failure): case-i.tex still says "the
  obligation of sub-phase 22i" — reword to 22k when the L8 node is restated (the natural
  same-commit moment).

## Hand-off / next phase

**Next commit: L8 — the Lemma-6.5 arm**, discharging `h65`. §1.54(a3) steps 1–2: Claim 6.6 graph
side (~2–3 commits) + the Π°-placement producer (own design/signature-pin pass first). The dispatch
(`case_I_dispatch`) already landed in 22h/L5b-iii; Claim 6.6 concludes inside `k = 0`, no all-`k`
generality needed. Target node: `lem:case-I-dispatch` (flip red→green). After L8 close: **L9** (zero-carry
spine `theorem_55_all_k`, wire `case_III_realization` directly), **L10** (Thm 5.6 `d=3`). After L7–L10
close, 22k delivers the KT-strength Thm 5.5 → 5.6 at `d = 3`; then Phase 23 (general `d`).

## Decisions made during this phase

(One-line verdicts; full proof-technique detail in §1.56–§1.69 design sections, docstrings, git.)

- **L7b — `case_III_realization` restate + `h622` discharge (2026-06-15, sonnet; warning-bearing →
  coordinator-repaired):** dropped `h622` carry; added `hn : bodyBarDim n = screwDim 2`; upgraded
  `hIH` to all-`k` form. `h622lb` discharged via `splitOff_removeVertex_minimalKDof` + all-`k` IH +
  `exists_rankPolynomial_of_IH_linking` + footnote-6 non-root + arithmetic. Thin wrapper
  `case_III_realization_0dof` keeps `theorem_55_d3` building (Flag F1) until L9. Came in
  warning-bearing (5 `longLine`, false "all clean" attestation); coordinator follow-up `5b6cf9a` reflowed them.
- **L7 extraction + hanging-pin gate (2026-06-15, coordinator):** L7b folded the `h622lb` discharge
  inline, leaving `lem:case-III-nested-rank-lower` `\leanok` with **no `\lean{}` pin** (uncheckable
  green). Extracted the discharge as the standalone `PanelHingeFramework.case_III_nested_rank_lower`
  (`5492158`, `|V(Gab)| ≥ 2` form — drops the 4th-vertex `c`); node now pinned + checkdecls-verified.
  Added a **hanging-pin gate to `blueprint/lint.sh`** (`52c3175`, check 4: statement `\leanok` w/o
  `\lean{}`); audit confirmed it was the only such node (358/358 others clean). Promoted to:
  blueprint/CLAUDE.md *Static checks before commit*.
- **L7a — the V8-a non-relabel rank-poly brick (2026-06-15, opus, clean):** `exists_rankPolynomial_of_IH_linking`
  + `finrank_span_rigidityRows_ofNormals_eq` (`CaseI.lean`). §1.69(c) resolved favorably (relabel
  core specialized cleanly to `f = id`). Zero friction; gates clean, axiom-clean.
- **L7 signature pin (2026-06-15, design §1.69, opus):** `case_III_realization` restates to carry
  the all-`k` IH (drop `h622`); `h622lb` is *derived* — IH at `G_v` (`k' ≤ D−2`) gives rank
  `D(m−1)−k'`, transferred to the given `(ends, q)` by the **landed deficiency-aware rank-polynomial
  idiom** (§1.62, `exists_rankPolynomial_of_le_finrank_linking` + footnote-6 non-root), NOT the
  `def=0`-only seed-rank bridge. V8 RESOLVED to buildable; the one new brick is **V8-a** (L7a,
  `exists_rankPolynomial_of_IH_linking`, the non-relabel/`f=id` mirror of the landed relabel
  rank-poly, P≈3). L7 forces the `hsplitZero` spine slot to be all-`k`-conditioned (`theorem_55_all_k`,
  L9) — `theorem_55_d3`'s `k=0` IH cannot supply the `k'>0` nested instance. No motive change; no user
  adjudication. **Finding:** the blueprint prose of `lem:case-III-nested-rank-lower` cites the seed
  bridge for the rank transfer — wrong for `def>0`; fix to the rank-polynomial extractor at the L7b flip.
- **Phase-open (2026-06-15):** opened 22k from the 22i L7–L10 design basis; transcribed the
  carries table with consumption sites re-located into the post-22j-perf 5-file chain
  (`AlgebraicInduction/{GenericityDevice,Coupling,CaseI,CaseII,CaseIII,Theorem55}.lean`).
  Red-node consistency gate run on the L7–L10 targets (`lem:case-III-nested-rank-lower`,
  `lem:case-III-seed-rank-bridge`, `lem:case-I-dispatch`, `def:genuine-hinge-realization`,
  `thm:theorem-55`, `thm:theorem-55-d3-instance`, `lem:case-III`, `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`):
  each statement+proof routes through the same argument the carries table claims; no live-route
  `\uses`/proof-step at a superseded node (`blueprint/lint.sh` green). One finding: blueprint
  prose mis-attributes the `h65`/all-`k` discharge to 22i (now 22k) at three sites — recorded in
  *Blockers*, deferred to an L7/L8 restate commit (not fixed in the phase-open).
