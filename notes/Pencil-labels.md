# PENCIL — label registry and minting rule

**What this is.** The single index of every **label token** in use across the
Phase-39 (PENCIL) doc set, plus the rule that governs minting new ones. It is
an *index*, not mathematics: every row points at the section that owns the
label, and **that section (and the workbook's *State of (K)* map) is
authoritative for what the label means and what its status is**. Nothing here
states a verdict; the status column is a one-word pointer.

**Who reads it.** Anyone about to *mint* a label (mandatory — see the rule
below) and anyone unsure what a bare `(C6)`-style token refers to.

**Files in scope.** `notes/Pencil-informal.md` (the (K) workbook),
`notes/Pencil-W4-informal.md` (the W4 residual workbook),
`notes/Pencil-strategy.md`, `notes/Pencil-fanout.md`, `notes/Phase39.md`,
`notes/Phase39-design.md`.

## Why this file exists — the measured diagnosis

Six recorded confusion incidents motivated the 2026-08-05 reorganization pass.
Sorting them by cause:

- **Naming (3):** the (C6)/(C7) collision that needed coordinator fixup
  `86d77894`; the hand-written disambiguation `notes/Phase39.md` still carries
  for §(SAFE-RES)'s (C7)/(C8) vs §(K-slide-comb)'s same-numbered labels; and
  the 2026-08-05 broad recon picking `U1`–`U3` *specifically to dodge* the
  workbook's `(C6)`/`(C7)`.
- **Canonical home (3):** dispatch-log F12's claim propagating to eleven
  places; (OUT) landing in the strategy doc instead of the workbook (moved in
  `390a1a1f`); the route-σ arc written out three times in the phase note
  (collapsed in `9d6ab712`).

**None of the six was caused by file length.** This matters for how the set is
organized: length is a *context-budget* problem (addressed by the navigation
indexes in the workbook and the design doc), and it is a different problem from
the one that produced the incidents.

**The refined diagnosis.** The working hypothesis going in was *"sections mint
labels independently, so cross-section collisions are structurally
inevitable."* That is half right, and the half it gets wrong changes the fix:

1. **Independent minting is not sufficient to cause a collision.** Three label
   families are minted independently and have **never** collided across the
   7,438 lines of the two workbooks: `Λ0a`–`Λ0i`/`Λ1`/`Λ2`/`Λ3` (§(K-Λ)),
   `σ1`–`σ7` (§(K-σ)), `PC1`/`PC2`/`PC3`/`PC5`/`PC6`/`PC-Z`/`PC-OBS`
   (§(K-pure)) — together with the `K-…` gap names and `OUT`/`SAFE-RES`. What
   they have in common is a **topic tag inside the token**.
2. **Every bare single-letter family has collided.** `C`, `D`, `M`, `N`, `P`,
   `R`, `T`, `W`, `F` — see the collision table below. The token carries no
   owner, so the reader cannot resolve it and the next author cannot see that
   the letter is taken.
3. **A file boundary does not help.** The (C6)/(C7) incident was *already* a
   cross-**file** collision: §(SAFE-RES)'s (C7)/(C8) live in
   `Pencil-W4-informal.md`, §(K-slide-comb)'s (C6)/(C7) in
   `Pencil-informal.md`, and the strategy doc's C1/C2/C3 in a third file.
   Splitting the W4 arc into its own file on 2026-08-05 did not prevent the
   collision — it is why the phase note needs a hand-written disambiguation.
   **The namespace has to be in the citation token, because the filesystem is
   invisible at the point of reference.**
4. **A third failure mode, not previously named: step numbers and claim labels
   share one namespace.** §(K-slide-cl) writes `(C2)` for *Step C2* and `(C1)`
   for a claim stated in Step C1; §(K-dom) has Steps D0–D7 *and* claims
   (D1)–(D4); §(K-pure) has Steps P0–P9 while §(K-Λ) mints driver blocks
   (P1)–(P7); §(K-σ) has both a Step σ5 and a claim (σ5). Even a
   well-prefixed section is ambiguous to itself here.

So the fix is a **token-level namespace plus a consulted registry**, not a
physical reorganization.

## The minting rule

Four clauses. They are cheap; clause 1 is the one that actually prevents the
next collision.

- **(L1) Uniqueness, checked against this file.** Before minting a label, grep
  this registry for the token. If it is taken, **prefix it with your section's
  tag** (the *tag* column below) — e.g. a new claim in §(K-dom) becomes
  `(DM-5)`, not `(D5)`. Add the row **in the same commit that mints the
  label**. A label that is not in this registry does not exist.
- **(L2) Never label a step.** Steps are cited with the word *Step* —
  *Step 3a*, *Step σ5*, *Step D2* — and are **never** written as a bare
  parenthesized token. `(D2)` always means the claim; *Step D2* always means
  the step. This retires failure mode 4 without renaming anything.
- **(L3) Cross-section citations are qualified.** Inside its owning section a
  label may be written bare. **Anywhere else** — another section, another file,
  `Phase39.md`, a commit message, a dispatch prompt — write the owner:
  `§(K-slide-comb) (C6)`, `§(SAFE-RES) (C7)`, `strategy §4 C1`. This is the
  only clause that applies to the *existing* corpus.
- **(L4) Grandfathering — do not rename.** Every label below predates this
  file and carries up to ~40 cross-references; renaming would churn far more
  than it buys, and this pass renamed **nothing**. Collisions among existing
  labels are resolved by (L3), not by renumbering.

## Reserved namespaces — the three incoming parallel dispatches

Reserved 2026-08-05 for the three-way fan-out of `notes/Pencil-fanout.md`, so
that three concurrent read-only passes cannot collide with each other or with
anything above. Each prefix was verified **0-hit** across `*.md`, `*.tex`,
`*.lean`, `*.py`, `*.m2` at reservation time, as was each section name.

| dispatch | scope | **reserved label prefix** | **reserved section name** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | U1 + U2 + (K)-option-B fused — the annihilator target, the cycle-space / cocircuit ground set, the stress-function reading | **`ANH-`** (*AN*nihilator + *H*inge-rate) → `(ANH-1)`, `(ANH-2)`, … | **`§(K-ann)`** |
| **B** | the (viii) measurement plus (OUT)'s combinatorial half | **`OC-`** (*O*uter *C*riterion) → `(OC-1)`, `(OC-2)`, … | **`§(K-out)`** |
| **C** | the over-`ℂ̄` direction | **`AC-`** (*A*lgebraically *C*losed) → `(AC-1)`, `(AC-2)`, … | **`§(K-clos)`** |

Binding on all three: **use your prefix for every label you mint**, including
sub-claims and driver blocks; cite everything you did not mint in the qualified
form (L3); and if you open a section, use the reserved name so the coordinator
can land three returns serially without a rename. A dispatch that needs a
second prefix (e.g. a driver-block family distinct from its claims) appends a
letter — `ANH-M1`, `ANH-M2` — rather than reaching for a bare letter.

Existing gap names, statuses and section verdicts are **not** in these
dispatches' namespace: moving a status is a coordinator action, per the fan-out
landing checklist.

## Registry — `notes/Pencil-informal.md` (the (K) workbook)

Status keywords are pointers to the owning section's verdict block and the
*State of (K)* map, which remain authoritative.

(K-bare)/(K-bare-ext), and **(K-res)** (owned by the W4 workbook, below). These
are already tagged and collision-free; keep the `K-` form for any new gap.

## Registry — `notes/Pencil-W4-informal.md` (the W4 residual workbook)

| owning section | tag | labels in use | what the family is |
|---|---|---|---|
| §`hnoGood'` vacuity | `NG-` | **(C1)–(C6)** | structure of a maximal cluster's contraction: (C1) simplicity is free, (C2) outside degrees preserved, (C3) boundary attachment points are hubs, (C4) `hcard` fails only at `v*`, (C5) no triangle through `v*`, (C6) the boundary-hub budget |

| §widened kernels (routes 1/3) | `WK-` | (E-loc); **(K-res)** | the routes-1/3 kernel widening; (K-res) is the widened kernel carried as a byte-identical sibling of `hK` |

## Registry — `notes/Pencil-strategy.md`, `Phase39.md`, `Phase39-design.md`

| owner | labels in use | what the family is |
|---|---|---|
| strategy §4 | **C1**, **C2**, **C3** | the three candidate stronger inductive invariants (C1 = dominance of the `V_bc` map, run and struck) |
| strategy §4.6 | **U1**, **U2**, **U3** | the three ranked live class-uniformity successors |

## Collision table — bare tokens that are ambiguous today

Resolve every one of these by (L3): write the owner. Listed because each is a
token a reader will meet bare in the existing corpus.

| bare token | meaning 1 | meaning 2 | meaning 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **(C1)–(C6)** | §(K-slide-cl) *Steps* C0–C5 (+ claim (C1)) | W4 §`hnoGood'` cluster claims (C1)–(C6) | strategy §4 candidate invariants C1/C2/C3 |
| **(C7)**, (C8) | §(K-slide-comb) (C7) — the length-4 menu repair | W4 §(SAFE-RES) (C7)/(C8) — ear length / cluster dichotomy | — |
| **(D1)–(D4)** | §(K-dom) claims | §(K-dom) *Steps* D0–D7 | §(K-slide-comb) *Steps* D0–D5 |
| **(M1)–(M4)** | §(K-Λ) `lambda1.m2` driver blocks | §(K-Δ) the three hypothesis tests | — |
| **(P1)–(P7)** | §(K-Λ) `lambda0.m2` driver blocks | §(K-pure) *Steps* P0–P9 | — |
| **(R1)–(R5)** | *Shared dictionary* rigid-graph facts | R1/R2/R3 the opening recon questions | — |
| **(T)** | §(K-pitch) (T1)–(T5) transfer claims | W4 §(SAFE-RES) (T) — triangle-freeness | — |
| **(W1)–(W4)** | §(K-slide) limit-system conditions | the phase's **work packages** W0–W5 (**W4 = `hcontract`**) | — |
| **(N1), (N2)** | §(K-Δ) the two readings | N8/N9/N10/N10b the W4 gates | — |
| **(F1)** | §(K-flank) claim / *Steps* F0–F7 | `dispatch-log.md` F-rows (F5, F11, F12, …) | — |
| **(σ5)** | §(K-σ) claim (σ5) | §(K-σ) *Step σ5* (the four obligations) | — |
| **(S1)–(S5)** | §(K-slide) claims | `S29` test shape (distinct form; noted for completeness) | — |

The two most dangerous in live prose are **(W4)** — because "W4" reads as
`hcontract` everywhere in `Phase39.md` and as the limit-system condition
everywhere in §(K-slide)/§(K-pure) — and **(C6)/(C7)**, which have already
caused one landed fixup.
