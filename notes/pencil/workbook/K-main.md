## §(K-main) — the main component `X₀`: over a fixed planar picture the pencil condition is linear in the heights, the flat rank is an exact identity in `dim L(q)`, and the census of `X₀`

Answering `notes/pencil/W4-reopen.md` **P1** (the main-component census, ranked first by the
2026-09-23 strategy re-think; nothing in it commissioned beyond that ranking). Tag `MC-`
(`notes/pencil/labels.md`). Driver: `notes/scripts/w4/maincomp.py`. The object is the smark brief's
§1 pencil configuration (`notes/attacks/smark/brief.md`), read here in an affine chart; the
derivation is the hand-off's (F1)–(F3), written out and checked. **(MC-4)** was not in the
hand-off: it makes the flat rank an exact identity rather than a citation.

**Verdict.** (MC-1)–(MC-6) and (MC-9) are *proven-informally* and elementary. The one citation
any of them uses, Jackson–Jordán's pin-collinear theorem (the smark brief §3(a); published, not
formalized, checked only over `ℝ` — `notes/Phase39-design.md` field-hypothesis recon, row S5), is
needed only for the *equality* case of (MC-4)(b), and every use of it below is flagged.
**The census RAN on 2026-09-23. Its outcome is row A′ of the decision table fixed before any run**
(*The census — results*). `X₀` attains at all 10 252 members, including every simple 2EC graph on
at most 8 vertices; there are 0 `SHORT`s. At every drawn point the first-order term alone reached
the target ((MC-7), (MC-8)). The exception is nondegeneracy: at 28 distinct certified-feasible graphs, all
with a proper rigid subgraph, `X₀` supplies the distinct motive but not the generic one ((MC-9)).
The class statements (MC-10) are *open*. What follows is the PI's call.
**2026-09-24 (no census re-run), *After the census*.**
- (MC-11): the gain is **exact** at every admissible point. So (MC-8) is a theorem, and
  (MC-10)(a) ⟺ (MC-10)(b), a plane-framework statement.
- (MC-14): settles (MC-10)(c), with its converse. `X₀` is nondegenerate iff `hcard` holds and no
  `def₂`-rigid subgraph holds two hubs of a common `closedHubNbhd`. This is modulo Jackson–Jordán,
  and it is checked on all of `exh8`.
- (MC-15): `hK`'s habitat has no `def₂`-rigid subgraph at all. So there (MC-10)(a) alone would give
  `hK`'s conclusion.
- Step MC10, the ear step on `X₀`:
  - Closed ears and open ears with `k ≥ 5` are unconditional (MC-20).
  - `k = 4` is proved under strong induction (MC-24)/(MC-25).
  - So **every θ-graph attains on `X₀`** (MC-21), the first infinite class.
  - Open ears with `k ≤ 3` are open (MC-27). So is the relative-dof conjecture (MC-23), which is
    certified on ≤ 7 vertices.
  - A second reader re-derived Steps MC7–MC9; its fixes are applied.
  - The ear-step claims were checked by the coordinator, not by a second reader.
**What would change this:** an admissible `q` where `maincomp.py`'s (MC-4) assert fires (the
identity is false), an error in the Plücker bookkeeping of *Step MC3* (checked per instance by the
(MC-3) assert), or a `SHORT` in an extended population.

**Standing hypotheses (H).** `G` is finite, simple and connected, with minimum degree `≥ 2`. `K` is
an infinite field. A **planar picture** is `q : V → K²`, `q_v = (x_v, y_v)`; it is **admissible**
if `q_u ≠ q_v` for every edge `uv` and `q(N[v])` is not collinear for every `v` (`|N[v]| ≥ 3` by the
minimum degree). A configuration in the affine chart is `p_v = (x_v, y_v, z_v, 1) ∈ K⁴`, written
`p = (q, z)` with `z ∈ K^V` the **heights**. `Aff(q) ⊆ K^V` is the 3-dimensional space of heights
`z_w = αx_w + βy_w + γ`, the restrictions of global affine functions (dimension 3 because an
admissible `q` is not collinear).

---

### Step MC1 — the pencil condition is linear in the heights

> **(MC-1)** `[PROVED]` *(the hand-off's (F1))* Let `q` be admissible. Then `p = (q, z)` has every
> closed neighbourhood coplanar **iff** `z ∈ L(q)`, where
> `L(q) := {z ∈ K^V : for every v, z|N[v] is the restriction to q(N[v]) of an affine function of K²}`.
> Every such `p` is a pencil configuration: adjacent points are distinct, and the plane `π_v` is unique
> and non-vertical at every vertex. `L(q)` is a linear subspace containing `Aff(q)`.

*Proof.* (⇐) If `z_w = α_v x_w + β_v y_w + γ_v` on `N[v]`, the points of `N[v]` lie on the plane
`z = α_v x + β_v y + γ_v`. (⇒) Let `ax + by + cz + d = 0` contain `N[v]`'s points. If `c = 0` then
`ax + by + d` vanishes on the non-collinear set `q(N[v])`, forcing `a = b = d = 0`. So `c ≠ 0` and
`z = −(ax + by + d)/c` on `N[v]`. The plane is unique because `q(N[v])` is not collinear. Adjacent
points are distinct because `q_u ≠ q_v`. Linearity: the condition at `v` says `z|N[v]` lies in the
image of the evaluation map `Aff(K²) → K^{N[v]}`. That map is injective (non-collinear), so the
image is a 3-dimensional subspace, of codimension `deg v − 2`. ∎

So `dim L(q) ≥ max(3, 3|V| − 2|E|)`. Only hubs impose conditions: `deg v − 2 = 0` at a degree-2 vertex.

### Step MC2 — the main component `X₀`

> **(MC-2)** `[PROVED]` *(the hand-off's (F2))* Let `ℓ₀` be the minimum of `dim L(q)` over
> admissible `q`, and let `U` be the set of admissible `q` with `dim L(q) = ℓ₀`. Then `U` is a
> nonempty Zariski-open subset of `K^{2V}`, `B := {(q, z) : q ∈ U, z ∈ L(q)}` is a vector bundle over
> `U`, and its closure `X₀` is irreducible of dimension `2|V| + ℓ₀`. `X₀` contains the **flat
> configurations** `(q, 0)`, `q ∈ U`. Rank is lower semicontinuous, so the maximum of the molecular
> rank over `B` is attained on a dense open subset of `B`. One point of `B` at the target rank
> therefore proves that `X₀`'s generic point attains. It also gives, at `G`, a rank-attaining pencil
> configuration with adjacent points distinct: the rank and distinctness content of
> `HasDistinctPencilRealization K 3 G`, via the rank bridge (smark brief §3.3(a)).

*Proof.* Admissibility is a finite conjunction of non-vanishing conditions (`q_u − q_v ≠ 0`, a
nonzero `3 × 3` minor of `[1, x_w, y_w]_{w ∈ N[v]}`), so it is open. It is nonempty because `K` is
infinite. By (MC-1), over an admissible `q`, `L(q)` is the projection to `z` of the kernel of the
matrix `M(q)` of the linear system `z_w = h_v(q_w)` (`v ∈ V`, `w ∈ N[v]`) in the unknowns `(z, h)`,
`h_v ∈ Aff(K²)`. The projection is injective because `h_v` is determined by `z` on the
non-collinear `q(N[v])`. `M(q)` has entries linear in `q`, so `rank M(q)` is lower semicontinuous
and `U` (maximal rank) is open. On `U` the rank is constant, so the kernel is a vector bundle.
Its total space is irreducible because `U` is. The zero section lies in `B`. The last two sentences
of the claim are semicontinuity on the irreducible `X₀`. ∎

A point `(q, z)` with `q` admissible but `q ∉ U` is still a pencil configuration by (MC-1), so it is
still a witness for the conjecture at `G`, but it lies on a jump stratum and is not certified to be
on `X₀`. The driver certifies `q ∈ U` through (MC-4)(b): `dim L(q) = 3 + def₂` is the least value
`dim L` can take, so at such a `q` we have `ℓ₀ = 3 + def₂` and `q ∈ U`.

For the **generic** motive the point must also satisfy `IsNondegPencilRealization`'s four
conjuncts (`Motive.lean`, `IsNondegPencilRealization`). On `B`, conjunct 1 (the panel realization),
conjunct 2 (adjacent points distinct) and conjunct 4 (closed neighbourhoods of non-hubs
independent: three non-collinear points) hold by (MC-1). **Conjunct 3** (the normals of
`closedHubNbhd v` linearly independent) is not automatic on `X₀`. The census reports it per
instance.

### Step MC3 — the hinges are affine in the heights

> **(MC-3)** `[PROVED]` *(the hand-off's (F3))* For fixed `q`, the hinge extensor
> `C_e = p_u ∧ p_v` of an edge `e = uv` is affine in `z`. In the Plücker order `(01, 02, 03, 12, 13, 23)`
> of `exactcore.PL`,
> `C_e = (x_u y_v − y_u x_v, 0, x_u − x_v, 0, y_u − y_v, 0) + (0, x_u z_v − z_u x_v, 0, y_u z_v − z_u y_v, 0, z_u − z_v)`,
> and the second term is linear in `z`. Hence the **augmented motion matrix** `A(q, z)` (rows `(e, k)`:
> `(m_u − m_v − ω_e C_e)_k`; columns `6|V| + |E|`) is `A₀(q) + A₁(q; z)`, with `A₁` linear in `z` and
> supported on the `ω` columns. If every `C_e ≠ 0`, then `rank A = |E| + rank R`, where `R` is the
> 5-rows-per-hinge rigidity matrix (the landed `rigidityRows` model, `kbare_common.build_rigidity`).
> The rank at `(q, z)` is invariant under `z ↦ tz + a` for `t ≠ 0` and `a ∈ Aff(q)`, so on the fibre
> it depends only on the class of `z` in `P(L(q)/Aff(q))`.

*Proof.* `p = (x, y, z, 1)`. Each Plücker coordinate `p_u[i] p_v[j] − p_u[j] p_v[i]` has at most one
of `i, j` equal to `2` (the `z` index), so it has no `z_u z_v` term. On `ker A`, `ω_e` is determined
by `m` whenever `C_e ≠ 0`. So `ker A ≅ {m : m_u − m_v ∈ span C_e for all e} = ker R`, and
`rank A = 6|V| + |E| − dim ker R = |E| + rank R`. The map `(x, y, z) ↦ (x, y, tz + αx + βy + γ)` is an
affine, hence projective, transformation of `K³` when `t ≠ 0`, and the molecular rank is
projectively invariant. ∎

The quadric condition on hinge lines (the Klein quadric) never appears: the parametrization by
`(q, z)` absorbs it, and the rank question over a fixed `q` is the generic rank of an affine matrix
family over the linear space `L(q)`. The last sentence of (MC-3) says the fibre is effectively
`P^{ℓ₀ − 4}`. Under Jackson–Jordán (MC-4(b)) that is `P^{def₂ − 1}`: at `def₂ = 1` (for example `C₄`)
every non-flat point of the fibre has the same rank.

### Step MC4 — the flat rank is an identity in `dim L(q)`

> **(MC-4)** `[PROVED]` Under (H), at every admissible `q`:
> **(a)** `rank R(q, 0) = 6|V| − 3 − dim L(q)`, exactly;
> **(b)** `dim L(q) ≥ 3 + def₂(G)`, where `def₂(G) = max_P [3(|P| − 1) − 2d(P)]` (Lean `deficiency G 2`);
> **(c)** hence `rank R(q, 0) ≤ 6(|V| − 1) − def₂(G)`, with **equality iff `dim L(q) = 3 + def₂(G)`**.
> The corpus's flat law `rank(flat) = 6(|V|−1) − def₂` (§(K-bare-ext) (BE-20)(ii), inheriting
> (BE-13); the smark brief §3(a)) is therefore **exactly** the statement that equality holds in (b)
> at generic `q`. That equality is where the Jackson–Jordán theorem enters, and it is the only place.

*Proof.* At `z = 0`, (MC-3)'s formula puts every `C_e` in `W_Π := span(e₀₁, e₀₃, e₁₃)`, the Plücker
coordinates of lines in the plane `Π = {z = 0}`. Split `K⁶ = W_Π ⊕ W′`, with
`W′ = span(e₀₂, e₁₂, e₂₃)`, and write `m_v = (m_v^Π, m_v′)`. The motion condition
`m_u − m_v ∈ span C_e` splits into `m_u′ = m_v′` (three conditions) and
`m_u^Π − m_v^Π ∈ span C_e` (two conditions, since `C_e ≠ 0`).
*The glued block.* Because `G` is connected, `m′` is constant: a 3-dimensional contribution to the
kernel.
*The 2-condition block.* `W_Π = Λ²Π̂` with `Π̂ = span(e₀, e₁, e₃) ≅ K³`, and `p̂_w = (x_w, y_w, 1)`.
Identify `Λ²K³ ≅ (K³)^∨` by `a ∧ b ↦ det(a, b, ·)`, and `(K³)^∨` with the affine functions `h` on
`K²` (`h(x, y) = ⟨h, (x, y, 1)⟩`). Under this identification `span(p̂_u ∧ p̂_v)` is the line of affine
functions vanishing at `q_u` and `q_v`. So the block's kernel is
`F(q) = {(h_v)_v : (h_u − h_v)(q_u) = (h_u − h_v)(q_v) = 0 for every edge uv}`.
*The bijection `F(q) ≅ L(q)`.* Define `Φ(h)_w := h_w(q_w)`. For `u ∈ N(v)`: `Φ(h)_u = h_u(q_u) = h_v(q_u)`,
and `Φ(h)_v = h_v(q_v)`. So `Φ(h)|N[v] = h_v|q(N[v])` is affine, and `Φ(h) ∈ L(q)`. Conversely, for
`z ∈ L(q)` let `Ψ(z)_v` be the unique affine interpolant of `z` on the non-collinear `q(N[v])`. For an
edge `uv`, both `q_u` and `q_v` lie in `N[u] ∩ N[v]`, so `Ψ(z)_u` and `Ψ(z)_v` agree there, and
`Ψ(z) ∈ F(q)`. The composites are the identity: `Φ∘Ψ` by construction, `Ψ∘Φ` by uniqueness of the
interpolant. Hence `dim ker R(q, 0) = 3 + dim L(q)`, which is (a).
*(b).* The 2-condition block has 3-dimensional bodies and 2 rows per edge. For a partition `P`, the
rows of edges inside a part vanish on part-wise constant `h` (a `3|P|`-dimensional space), so they
have rank `≤ 3|V| − 3|P|`. The crossing edges contribute `≤ 2d(P)`. So
`dim F(q) ≥ 3|P| − 2d(P) = 3 + [3(|P| − 1) − 2d(P)]`; maximize over `P`.
*(c)* is (a) and (b) together. ∎

The bijection `Φ` is the classical correspondence between liftings of a plane picture and
motions of its dual framework: the projective duality of Maxwell–Cremona and scene analysis
(Whiteley; Crapo–Whiteley). **Citation to be verified before transcription.** The proof above is
self-contained and does not use it.

### Step MC5 — consequences, none of which uses Jackson–Jordán

> **(MC-5)** `[PROVED]` Under (H):
> **(i)** `def₃(G) ≤ def₂(G)`. Partition by partition, `[6(|P|−1) − 5d] − [3(|P|−1) − 2d] =
> 3(|P| − 1 − d(P)) ≤ 0`, because the parts of a connected graph are joined by `≥ |P| − 1` crossing
> edges. (This is BZAVOID's `def₂ ≥ def₃`, §(K-bare-ext) (BE-15); recorded here with its one-line
> proof because (ii) uses it.)
> **(ii)** The flat configuration at an admissible `q` attains `6(|V|−1) − def₃` **iff**
> `dim L(q) = 3 + def₃`, iff equality holds in (MC-4)(b) at `q` **and** `def₂ = def₃`.
> **(iii)** *(the W4-reopen "dichotomy worth trying to prove", on `X₀`)* If `X₀` is **flat** — that
> is, `ℓ₀ = 3`, so every configuration of `B` is planar — then `def₂ = def₃ = 0`, and the flat
> configuration at every admissible `q` with `dim L(q) = 3` has rank `6(|V| − 1)`: `G` is rigid, and
> `X₀` attains.

*Proof of (ii), (iii).* (ii): (MC-4)(a) gives flat rank `= 6|V| − 3 − dim L(q)`, which equals
`6(|V| − 1) − def₃` iff `dim L(q) = 3 + def₃`. By (MC-4)(b) and (i), `dim L(q) ≥ 3 + def₂ ≥ 3 + def₃`.
(iii): `ℓ₀ = 3` and (MC-4)(b) give `def₂ ≤ 0`, so `def₂ = 0`, and `def₃ = 0` by (i). Then
(MC-4)(a) gives flat rank `6|V| − 6`. ∎

**What (MC-5)(iii) does to §(K-bare-ext) (BE-23)(ii).** BINDUC measured *"forced flat ⇒
`def₂ = def₃`"* under an *aggressive* combinatorial plane-forcing closure. It reported the largest
`def₂` at a forced-flat graph as **5**, and flagged the closure as over-claiming. (MC-5)(iii) proves
the `X₀` form outright: flatness of `X₀` forces `def₂ = 0`, not merely `def₂ = def₃`. Any graph a
forcing closure flags as flat with `def₂ > 0` therefore has **non-flat** configurations on `X₀`,
because `dim L(q) ≥ 3 + def₂ > 3` at every admissible `q`. Such a flag is an over-claim of the
closure, as BINDUC said it might be. That section's statement is not changed; its measured
*"forced flat ⇒ `def₂ = def₃`"* is subsumed on `X₀`.

**The by-product for (α), restated with its dependency.** The W4-reopen hand-off's by-product —
*"wherever `def₂ = def₃` the flat configuration already attains with adjacent points distinct"* —
is (MC-5)(ii) **plus Jackson–Jordán at `G`**. Without the citation, what holds is: wherever
`dim L(q) = 3 + def₃` at some admissible `q`, the flat configuration at `q` attains with adjacent
points distinct. The census measures that equality directly (the `JJ` column).

### Step MC6 — the first-order structure at the flat point is a symmetric form on the lifting space

*Written after the spec commit `9e8aaec2`, while the census ran.* It changes no row of the decision
table.

At `(q, 0)` the motion space is the glued block (3 dimensions, trivial) plus `F(q) ≅ L(q)`, and the
perturbation directions are `L(q)` too. The **first-order gain** in direction `z` is
`rank(S₀ᵀ A₁(z) K₀)`, with `K₀` and `S₀` the kernel and left kernel of `A₀`. It lower-bounds
`rank A(q, z) − rank A₀`. The reason: `P(A₀ + tA₁)Q` in a basis adapted to `A₀` has Schur
complement `t(S₀ᵀA₁K₀ + O(t))`, and by (MC-3) `rank A(q, tz)` does not depend on `t ≠ 0`. The
needed gain is `def₂ − def₃`. The step below computes it.

**Notation.** An affine function `h = αx + βy + γ` is written as the vector `ĥ = (α, β, γ)`, so that
`h(q_w) = ĥ · p̂_w` with `p̂_w = (x_w, y_w, 1)`. For an edge `e = (u, w)` (in `edges` order), set
`ℓ_e := p̂_u × p̂_w ≠ 0`. A flex `h ∈ F(q)` has `ĥ_u − ĥ_w = ω_e(h) ℓ_e`. `Z₁(G)` is the cycle space
(signed edge vectors, zero net flow at every vertex).

> **(MC-6)** `[PROVED]` Under (H), at an admissible `q`, define the bilinear map
> `β : F(q) × F(q) → (Z₁(G) ⊗ K³)^∨` by `β(k, h)(μ) := Σ_{e = (u,w)} det(μ_e, k̂_w, ĥ_u − ĥ_w)`.
> **(i)** `β` is **symmetric**. **(ii)** `β(k, h) = 0` whenever `k` or `h` is a trivial (constant)
> flex, so `β` descends to `Sym²(L(q)/Aff(q)) → (Z₁ ⊗ K³)^∨`. **(iii)** For `z ∈ L(q)`, the
> first-order gain in direction `z` equals `rank β(Ψz, ·)`, with `Ψ` the bijection of *Step MC4*.
> So `X₀` attains **to first order** iff some `z ∈ L(q)` has
> `dim ker β(Ψz, ·) = 3 + def₃` on `F(q)`, i.e. `def₃` beyond the trivial flexes.

*Proof.* (iii) first. By the block split of *Step MC4*, the left kernel of `A₀` is the direct sum
of the 2-condition block's stresses (supported on `W_Π`) and the glued block's stresses. The
latter are `λ′ ∈ (K³)^E` with zero net flow at every vertex, i.e. `Z₁ ⊗ K³`, supported on `W′`
(the `ω`-column constraint `λ_e · C_e = 0` involves only `W_Π`). `A₁(z)` is supported on the `ω`
columns, and by (MC-3) its values `−C′_e(z)` lie in `W′`, where
`C′_e = (x_u z_w − z_u x_w, y_u z_w − z_u y_w, z_u − z_w) = J a_e`,
`a_e := z_w p̂_u − z_u p̂_w`, `J = diag(1, 1, −1)`. So only glued-block stresses pair. In `K₀`, the
trivial `W′` motions have `ω = 0` and pair to zero. What is left is
`sᵀA₁(z)f = −Σ_e ⟨Jλ′_e, a_e⟩ ω_e(h)`. With `k = Ψz`, (MC-1) gives `z_u = k̂_w · p̂_u` and
`z_w = k̂_w · p̂_w`, because `u, w ∈ N[w]`. Hence `a_e = k̂_w × ℓ_e` by `a × (b × c) = b(a·c) − c(a·b)`,
and `ω_e(h) a_e = k̂_w × (ĥ_u − ĥ_w)`. Put `μ := −Jλ′`; `J` preserves zero net flow. Then
`sᵀA₁(z)f = Σ_e det(μ_e, k̂_w, ĥ_u − ĥ_w) = β(k, h)(μ)`. The identification of the `W_Π`-coordinates
of a flex with `ĥ` is the linear map `(c₀₁, c₀₃, c₁₃) ↦ (c₁₃, −c₀₃, c₀₁)`. It sends
`C_e|_{W_Π}` to `ℓ_e`, so `ω_e` is the same scalar in both pictures.
(i). Write `ĥ_u = ĥ_w + bℓ_e` and `k̂_u = k̂_w + aℓ_e`. Then
`det(μ_e, k̂_u, ĥ_u) − det(μ_e, k̂_w, ĥ_w) = det(μ_e, k̂_w, ĥ_u − ĥ_w) − det(μ_e, ĥ_w, k̂_u − k̂_w)`,
because the `ab` term has `ℓ_e` twice. Summing over `e`, the left side is
`Σ_v det(net flow of μ at v, k̂_v, ĥ_v) = 0`. So `β(k, h)(μ) = β(h, k)(μ)`.
(ii). A constant `h` has `ĥ_u − ĥ_w = 0`. A constant `k` then follows by (i). ∎

**Checked in the driver** (`beta_check`, run whenever `--gain` is given): `rank β(Ψz, ·)` over `ℚ`
equals the Schur-pairing gain, asserted per instance. Also asserted: symmetry on two basis pairs,
and vanishing on the constant flex. This was added to `maincomp.py` after the first census runs.
The re-runs with it in place are byte-identical to those runs (*The census — results*).

**What (MC-6) is for.** The census (below) finds the first-order gain **equal to `def₂ − def₃` at
every instance tested**. If that is a theorem, the rank question on `X₀` becomes a statement
about **plane** frameworks only: for generic `q` and `z` in the lifting space, the symmetric form
`β(Ψz, ·)` on the `def₂`-dimensional space `L(q)/Aff(q)` has kernel of dimension exactly `def₃`
(it is `≥ def₃` always, by the target bound). This is the P3 candidate. It is **not** argued here.

---

### The census — spec, fixed before any census run

**Question.** On each population below, does `X₀`'s generic point attain `6(|V|−1) − def₃`?

**Instrument** (`maincomp.py`; its docstring states the sampler support per `HARNESS.md`
*Evidence*). Per draw: `q` uniform on integers in `[−30, 30]`, rejected until admissible; an exact
basis of `L(q)`; `z` a uniform `[−30, 30]` integer combination of it. The rank is computed mod
`2⁶¹ − 1`. Since `rank_p ≤ rank_ℚ ≤ target`, **`rank_p = target` is a certificate**: an exhibited
attaining point, a theorem for that graph. A shortfall is recomputed in exact ℚ and redrawn, up to
4 more draws. The best draw is a **lower bound** on `X₀`'s generic rank, never a measurement of it.
A `SHORT` verdict is therefore *measured, not proved*, and travels with its cap (5 draws, scale 30).
Asserted per draw: (MC-1) forward (every closed neighbourhood coplanar, adjacent points distinct);
(MC-3) exact affineness along the fibre (first draw of each instance); (MC-4)(a) and (b).
Reported: `def₂`, `def₃`, `dim L(q)`, the flat rank, `JJ` (`dim L(q) = 3 + def₂`, which also
certifies `q ∈ U`, *Step MC2*), the rank, and the verdict. Also reported: whether the best draw
satisfies all four `IsNondegPencilRealization` conjuncts (`flanks.nondeg_conjuncts`, failing
conjunct named) and, with `--gain`, the first-order gain of *Step MC6*.
**Oracles:** `def₃` by the (6,6) pebble game and `def₂` by the (3,3) pebble game on `2G`. Both are
checked against brute-force partition maxima at `n ≤ 8` in `--selftest`, and `def₃` also against
`kbare_common.exact_deficiency`.

**Populations** (`maincomp.py --pool NAME`). Every member is kept iff it is simple and 2EC.
Counts were measured by building each population, which involves no census run.
- `battery` (9): `C₄`, `C₅`, `C₇`, `K₄`, `K_{3,3}`, `θ(2,2,2)`, `θ(3,4,5)`, `θ(5,3,4)`, `W19`.
- `exh8` (7 980): **every isomorphism class** of simple 2EC graphs on 3–8 vertices
  (1 / 3 / 11 / 60 / 502 / 7 403). They are generated in-driver by vertex augmentation with a
  stdlib canonical form. The connected-graph counts match OEIS A001349 and the 2EC counts match
  A007146 through `n = 8` (both asserted in `--selftest`). **This is the only exhaustive
  population.** It contains every small member of every habitat below.
- `thetas` (109): `θ(a, b, c)`, `a ≤ b ≤ c`, `b ≥ 2`, `a + b + c ≤ 16`. This covers the tight
  habitat thetas (`Σ = 12`) and smark's `thetacores.py` shapes (`Σ = 13`), rebuilt with
  `pitch.theta_edges` rather than imported.
- `habitats` (888): the kernel-(K) class shapes. These are `lambda.habitat_specs` (`θ(3,4,5)`,
  `NT21`, `NT24`, `NT30`), `kslidecl.MEMBERS` (7), and the exhaustive `G* = K₄` stratum of
  `kslidecomb.py --k4full` (877 shapes).
- `smark` (81 built, 78 kept): `G = side + ear_m`, `m ∈ {2, 3, 4}`, over the 27 sides of smark's
  `splitoff.py --sides all`. They are imported read-only from `notes/attacks/smark/drivers/`
  (`sideprof`, `adversarial`, `earcompose.ear_edges`). The 3 dropped members are not 2EC.
- `residuals` (260): the 255 recorded residual inhabitants (`wtri.recorded_pool()`, the (RS-12)
  pool, `|V|` 19–31), plus `W19`, `R20`, `S29` (`saferes.w29()`), `T32` (`weloc.T32`) and `NT21c3`.
- `peels` (928): `bgenuine.family()`, `G = H₁ + H₂` (`K₄` R-sides glued to free sides). The
  392 forced-coincident-flag peels are marked, and the count is asserted.
- **W4 branch 2** (the P2 population) is not a separate list. It is the members of all the above
  that are certified infeasible (`nogood_subdiv.provably_infeasible`, a *sufficient* certificate
  only) and have a proper rigid subgraph (`nogood_subdiv.rigid_vertex_sets`). The summary lists its
  `def₂ > def₃` members; by the hand-off's P2 those are (α)'s whole content.
- **Not included, with the reason:** smark's Case-2 hub graphs (`case2m2.CASES`: D3, E13, E15,
  E55, T10, …) are reduced sides `Γ` with leaves and connectors, not graphs `G`. The corpus has no
  canonical completion of them to a full `G`, and their 2-cores are trees or hub cycles (smark
  S27(vi)). smark's `census.py` girth-`≥ 7` pieces are also left out: their kept set is replayable
  only through that driver's own rng.

Each member is also classified as `feas` (`provably_feasible`: `hcard` and triangle-free, the
landed-sufficient criterion), `infeas` or `middle`, and as `rigid` or `norigid` (a proper rigid
subgraph exists or not). These classes let the summary separate the hand-off's habitats.

**Decision table** (the hand-off's, made operational; **written before any census run**):

| outcome | condition | what follows (nothing without a PI call) |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | every instance of every population certified `ATTAINS` | P3 becomes "prove the rank on `X₀`", an architecture change; `kres`, the contraction kernels and smark's O7e become unnecessary in principle; the PI decides what to stop |
| **A′** | as A, but at some **feasible** graph the attaining draws all fail conjunct 3 | `X₀` supplies the distinct motive there but not the generic one; P3 must also produce a nondegenerate point on `X₀` or elsewhere |
| **B** | some `G` is `SHORT` after all draws, and a project chart attains at `G` (an attaining witness recorded in the corpus, or one produced by an existing sampler run on `G`) | witnesses live off the main component; every generic-point strategy dies at those `G`; they are the hard core, and P3 asks which component attains and why |
| **C** | some `G` is `SHORT` after all draws, and no chart the project has attains at `G` | a counterexample candidate. First strengthen the `SHORT` (more draws, larger scale, an exact symbolic rank if feasible), then check the special components: the admissible `q` where `L(q)` jumps, and the non-admissible charts (vertical planes) |

The census ends at this table.

**Disclosure — the order of work.** Before this spec was written, a prototype of the driver's
core (not retained; `maincomp.py` supersedes it) was run on seven named graphs: `C₄`, `K₄`,
`K_{3,3}`, `θ(2,2,2)`, `θ(3,4,5)`, `θ(5,3,4)`, `W19`. It showed `ATTAINS` and `JJ` at all seven. It
motivated (MC-4)(a), which was then proved. Those seven are re-run in the committed `--battery`
mode. No population above was run before this table was fixed.

### The census — results (2026-09-23): outcome **A′**

*Run after the spec commit `9e8aaec2`. Seed `20260923`, 1 draw and up to 4 retries, scale 30,
`--gain`. Commands and times: `notes/scripts/README.md` §3. The first runs used the spec-commit
driver. The figures below come from re-runs with three additions: (MC-6)'s check, the corrected
gain yardstick (the needed gain at the drawn `q`, not `def₂ − def₃`), and the genericity column.
The re-runs differ from the first runs only in those lines and the wall-clock `built in` line;
`exh8`'s first run was stopped before it finished, so it has no such comparison. The landed
driver differs from the one that ran the census pools only by docstrings and the `--draw0`,
`--jjprobe` and `--k23` modes. `battery`, `thetas` and `smark` were re-run on it byte-identically,
apart from the timing line.*

> So the stratum lies on a **second irreducible component**, of dimension `≥ 13`. Its points are
> nondegenerate and attain. The generic motive of `K_{2,3}` lives there. This is the hand-off's "special components (the

**Reading the table against the decision table — outcome A′.** No `SHORT` anywhere, so neither
B nor C. At the certified-feasible graphs, the attaining `X₀` point is nondegenerate except at the
feasible graphs listed by the A-prime watch. Those are `θ(2,2,2)` outside `exh8`, and 28 graphs
in `exh8` (on 5–8 vertices, `θ(2,2,2)` among them). **Every one of them has a proper rigid
subgraph**, so no member of `hK`'s habitat (no proper rigid subgraph) is A′ on this library. Concretely:
- **`hK`'s conclusion** (`HasGenericPencilRealization` at feasible, no-proper-rigid `G`) holds at
  every `feas`-`norigid` member (996 outside `exh8`, 6 inside), at `X₀`'s generic point. Where
  the flat point misses, first-order gain alone reaches the target. This is the conclusion
  outright, with none of `hK`'s antecedents used.
- **(K-res)'s conclusion** holds at all 260 residuals, including `R20`, where the grid route's
  (RS-5) is refuted (§(K-res)). It holds at `X₀` and is nondegenerate.
- **(α)** (W4 branch 2, `def₂ > def₃`, the P2 population) holds at every one of the 928 peels, the
  10 `θ(1, 2, k)` and the 86 `exh8` members: `X₀` gives the distinct motive at each. The P2
  list is **not empty**, but `X₀` covers it, so on this library (α) is a consequence of the `X₀`
  rank statement rather than a kernel of its own.

**What this does and does not establish.** Every figure above is an exhibited certificate for one
graph. **Nothing** here is a class statement. The class statements that would carry an
architecture change are:

> **(MC-10)** `[CONJECTURED]` For every finite simple connected graph `G` of minimum degree `≥ 2`:
> **(a)** `X₀`'s generic point attains `6(|V| − 1) − def₃(G)`;
> **(b)** more strongly, at generic `q` and generic `z ∈ L(q)`,
> `dim ker β(Ψz, ·) = 3 + def₃(G)` on `F(q)`. That is a statement about **plane** frameworks and
> their liftings only ((MC-6));
> **(c)** if `G` is feasible and no two hubs of a common `closedHubNbhd` lie in a common
> `def₂`-rigid subgraph, `X₀`'s generic point is nondegenerate. This is the guess `K_{2,3}`
> suggests ((MC-9)); it is **not tested**, because the driver records only whether a proper rigid
> subgraph exists.

*(2026-09-24: (a) ⟺ (b) by (MC-11). (c) and its converse are (MC-14), `[INFORMAL]` modulo
Jackson–Jordán, so (c) is no longer a guess.)*

(b) ⟹ (a) by *Step MC6*. (a) would prove `HasDistinctPencilRealization K 3 G` for every simple
connected `G` of minimum degree `≥ 2`, **with no induction**. Jackson–Jordán is not needed for
that implication; the census uses it only to certify that a drawn `q` lies in `U`. With
(c), (a) also gives the generic motive wherever `X₀` is nondegenerate. At A′ graphs the generic
motive needs another component, as at `K_{2,3}`.

**What would change this:** a `SHORT` in any extension of the populations (outcome B or C). A
member where the first-order gain falls below the needed gain would not refute (a), but it would
refute (b). An A′ graph in `hK`'s habitat would break the reading that A′ is confined to graphs
with a proper rigid subgraph.

**Where the A′ exposure sits, and why it may be bounded (a sketch, not a proof).** At `K_{2,3}`
the mechanism is two hubs inside a common subgraph `H` with `def₂(H) = 0`. By (MC-4) plus
Jackson–Jordán applied to `H`, such an `H` is flat on `X₀`. **Whether each of the 28 `exh8` A′
graphs has this shape is not checked.** A `def₂`-rigid subgraph is also `def₃`-rigid
((MC-5)(i)), so in `hK`'s habitat (no proper rigid subgraph) this mechanism can occur only when
`G` itself has `def₂ = 0`. The census found **no** A′ graph without a proper rigid
subgraph. The exposure is therefore W4's generic motive at graphs that have rigid subgraphs,
i.e. branches 3a–3c. The distinct motive is not exposed at all.

**The census ends at this table** (W4-reopen P1); what follows is the PI's call. Outcome A′'s row
says P3 becomes "prove the rank on `X₀`", an architecture change. If (MC-10)(a) holds, the
distinct motive no longer needs smark's O7e programme, `hbareSplit` or (K-bare-c)/(α). On `hK`'s
habitat the same goes for `hK`, given nondegeneracy there. `kres` and (K-c) become unnecessary
wherever `X₀` is nondegenerate, which is all 260 residuals measured. P3 must also supply
nondegenerate points at A′ graphs, whose generic motive lives off `X₀` (as at `K_{2,3}`).

---

### After the census (2026-09-24): the gain is exact, and nondegeneracy on `X₀` is combinatorial

*Written 2026-09-24, continuing W4-reopen P1 at the PI's direction ("see if we can make progress
on the math without a new census first"). No census population was re-run, and no row of the
decision table moves. Two new drivers each check one identity or one equivalence per instance:
`w4/exactgain.py` checks (MC-11), `w4/nondegx0.py` checks (MC-12)/(MC-13).*

#### Step MC7 — the gain is exact

Step MC4 split the motion equations into a `W_Π`-block and a `W′`-block at `z = 0`. **The split
holds at every `z`.** The `W_Π`-coordinates of `C_e` are (MC-3)'s first summand, which does not
involve `z`. The `W′`-coordinates are `C′_e = J a_e(z)` with `a_e(z) := z_w p̂_u − z_u p̂_w`; this is
Step MC6's computation, which uses (MC-3)'s formula and not `z ∈ L(q)`. For `r : E → K³` write
`H(r) := {ω ∈ K^E : Σ_{e ∈ C} σ_C(e) ω_e r_e = 0 for every cycle C}`. This is the angular-velocity
space of the planar body-and-pin framework with pin `r_e` on edge `e`. Write `ℓ_e := p̂_u × p̂_w`, as
in Step MC6.

> **(MC-11)** `[PROVED]` *(the gain is exact)* Let `G` be connected, and let `q` have `q_u ≠ q_w` on
> every edge. Let `z ∈ K^V` be arbitrary: the framework at `p = (q, z)` is molecular (hinges
> concurrent at each `p_v`), not necessarily a pencil framework.
> **(i)** Its motion space is `{(h, m′) : h ∈ F(q), m′_u − m′_w = ω_e(h) J a_e(z) for every e = (u, w)}`.
> Hence its flexes modulo the six trivial ones are `H(ℓ) ∩ H(a(z))`, and
> `rank R(q, z) = 6(|V| − 1) − dim(H(ℓ) ∩ H(a(z)))`. The first factor depends on `q` alone (the
> flat, pin-collinear framework of Step MC4). The heights enter only through the trace pins
> `a_e(z)`, which are linear in `z`. `a_e` is the homogeneous point where the hinge line crosses
> `Π`, with last coordinate `z_w − z_u`. At a horizontal hinge it is the direction's point at
> infinity, scaled by the common height.
> **(ii)** If `q` is admissible and `z ∈ L(q)`, then **exactly**
> `rank R(q, z) = rank R(q, 0) + rank β(Ψz, ·) = 6|V| − 3 − dim ker_{F(q)} β(Ψz, ·)`, at every such
> point, with no genericity.

*Proof.* (i) The six equations `m_u − m_w − ω_e C_e = 0` of edge `e` separate into three
`W_Π`-coordinates and three `W′`-coordinates. The `W_Π`-block does not involve `z`. By Step MC4
its solutions `(m^Π, ω)` are the flat flexes `h ∈ F(q)`, with `ω = ω(h)` because `C_e|_{W_Π} ≠ 0`.
The `W′`-block, `m′_u − m′_w = ω_e J a_e`, is a coboundary equation for `m′ : V → K³`. It is
solvable iff the edge vector `(ω_e J a_e)_e` is orthogonal to `Z₁(G) ⊗ K³`, because over any field
the cut space of `K^E` is the orthogonal complement of the cycle space. Since `J` is invertible,
that is `ω ∈ H(a)`, and then `m′` is unique up to a constant. The constant `h` (3 dimensions) and
the constant `m′` (3 more) are the six trivial motions, and `F(q)/constants ≅ H(ℓ)` by
`h ↦ ω(h)`. Hence `dim ker R = 6 + dim(H(ℓ) ∩ H(a))`. (ii) Step MC6's proof identifies the pairing
of `(ω_e(h) J a_e)_e` with `λ′ ∈ Z₁ ⊗ K³` as `β(Ψz, h)(Jλ′)`, when `z ∈ L(q)` at admissible `q`.
Step MC6's `μ := −Jλ′` carries the opposite sign, which comes from `A₁ = −C′`; vanishing is
unaffected. So
the solvability condition is `β(Ψz, h) = 0` and `dim ker A(q, z) = 3 + dim ker_{F(q)} β(Ψz, ·)`. At
`z = 0` this is `3 + dim F(q)`, and (MC-3)'s `rank A = |E| + rank R` finishes. ∎

**Checked** in exact ℚ at every point drawn. (i) is checked by `exactgain.py --molecular`: 204
points on the battery, every simple 2EC graph on ≤ 5 vertices, and `θ` with sum ≤ 8. The heights
`z` are arbitrary and the pictures are only edge-injective, with scale 1 forcing degenerate
positions; the run takes about 4 s, first as the second reader's scratch check and then committed.
(ii) is checked by `exactgain.py`: 1 830 points over the battery,
every simple 2EC graph on ≤ 6 vertices, and `θ(a, b, c)` with `a + b + c ≤ 9`. The points include
131 jump points `q` (`dim L(q) > 3 + def₂`, found by `--jump 200` at scale 2) and special `z`
(each basis vector of `L(q)`, and a sum of two). The run takes about 50 s. Command:
`python3 notes/scripts/w4/exactgain.py --battery --exh 6 --thetas 9 --jump 200`.

#### Step MC8 — nondegeneracy on `X₀` is combinatorial

Planes are written in the chart as `π_w : z = α_w x + β_w y + γ_w`, with `P_w := (α_w, β_w, γ_w)`
(so `P = Ψz` on `B`). The normal of `π_w` in `K⁴` is `(α_w, β_w, −1, γ_w)`, up to scale. Linear
independence of such normals is therefore **affine** independence of the points `P_w ∈ K³`. For
`w ∈ N(v)`, `P_w − P_v = ±ω_{vw}(P) ℓ_{vw}`.

> **(MC-12)** `[PROVED]` Under (H), let `q` be in **general position**: admissible, with no three
> points of any `q(N[v])` collinear (a nonempty Zariski-open condition). General position is
> sufficient, not necessary. The proof uses it only for the triple `{q_v, q_{w₁}, q_{w₂}}` at a hub
> `v` with two hub neighbours; at such a collinear triple conjunct 3 fails for every `z`. Let `z ∈ L(q)` and
> `P = Ψz`. Then conjuncts 1, 2 and 4 of `IsNondegPencilRealization` hold at `(q, z)` (Step MC2),

*Proof.* Put `S = closedHubNbhd v ⊆ N[v]`. Every plane `π_w`, `w ∈ S`, contains `p_v`, so the
normals lie in the 3-dimensional `p_v^⊥`. So `|S| ≥ 4` fails conjunct 3, which gives (i). `|S| ≤ 1`
is automatic. For `|S| ∈ {2, 3}` there are two cases. If `v` is a hub, `S = {v, w₁(, w₂)}` with
`P_{w_i} − P_v = ±ω_i ℓ_i`. The `ℓ_i` are independent by general position, so the `P`'s are
affinely independent iff every `ω_i ≠ 0`. Each `vw_i` is a hub–hub edge, and every hub–hub edge
`uw` arises this way (in `closedHubNbhd u`); this gives (ii). If `v` is not a hub, then
`deg v = 2` and `S ⊆ {a, b}`. Then `P_a − P_b = ±ω_{va} ℓ_{va} ∓ ω_{vb} ℓ_{vb}`, which is nonzero iff
the pair `(ω_{va}, ω_{vb})` is not zero; this gives (iii). ∎

A `def₂`-**rigid subgraph** is `H ⊆ G` with `|V(H)| ≥ 2` and `def₂(H) = 0`. It is connected, and
by (MC-5)(i) it is also `def₃`-rigid. In a simple graph it has at least 3 vertices. Triangles
and `K_{2,3}` are examples. For an edge `e = uw` let `G_e` be `G` plus one new vertex `x` adjacent
to exactly `u` and `w`.

*Proof.* (a) A flex of `G_e` has `P_x − P_u ∥ ℓ_{xu}` and `P_x − P_w ∥ ℓ_{xw}`, and `P_u − P_w = ω_e ℓ_e`.
So `ω_e ℓ_e + ω_{wx} ℓ_{wx} + ω_{xu} ℓ_{xu} = 0`, where the three `ℓ`'s are the sides of the
non-degenerate triangle `q_u q_w q_x`. That forces every `ω` to vanish, so `P_x = P_u = P_w`.
Conversely, any `P ∈ F(G)` with `P_u = P_w` extends by `P_x := P_u`. The closed neighbourhoods
`N[x] = {x, u, w}` and `N[u] ∪ {x}` are non-collinear.
(b) Write `val(P) := 3(|P| − 1) − 2d(P)`. Take a partition of `V(G_e)` and look at where `x` goes.
If `x` is alone, the value is `val_G(P) − 1`. If `x` sits in `u`'s part (or `w`'s), the value is
`val_G(P) − 2·[u, w separated by P]`. If `x` sits in any other part, it is `val_G(P) − 4`. Hence
`def₂(G_e) = max(max_{P : u ∼ w} val_G(P), def₂(G) − 1)`, which is the dichotomy.
Parts of maximizing partitions are rigid. Refining a part `X` by a partition `Q` of `X` changes
`val` by `3(|Q| − 1) − 2d_{G[X]}(Q) ≤ 0`, so `def₂(G[X]) = 0`. Conversely, let `H ∋ u, w` be
rigid and `P` maximizing. Merge the `t` parts that meet `V(H)`. This changes `val` by
`−3(t − 1) + 2·(edges of G between the merged parts)`, which is `≥ −3(t − 1) + 2d_H(P|_H) ≥ 0`. So
the merged partition is still maximizing, and `u ∼ w` in it.
(c) *Only if.* Suppose no rigid subgraph contains `u, w`. By (a), (b), Jackson–Jordán at `G_e`
(generic `(q, q_x)`, so generic `q` for `G`) and (MC-4)(b) at `G`:
`dim{P ∈ F(G, q) : P_u = P_w} = dim F(G_e) = 3 + def₂(G_e) = 2 + def₂(G) < 3 + def₂(G) ≤ dim F(G, q)`.
*If.* Suppose `u, w ∈ V(H)` with `H` rigid. Every `P ∈ F(G, q)` restricts to a flex of `H` at `q|_H`
(generic for `H`). By Jackson–Jordán at `H`, `dim F(H) = 3 + def₂(H) = 3`, so the restriction is
constant and `P_u = P_w`. ∎

> with two hub neighbours. On the A′ graphs this is exactly the `K_{2,3}` mechanism of (MC-9).

*Proof.* **If.** Fix a hub–hub edge `e`. It lies in no rigid subgraph, so `ω_e ≢ 0` on `F(q)` by
(MC-13)(c). Now take a degree-2 vertex `v` with hub neighbours `a, b`. Suppose both `ω_{va} ≡ 0` and
`ω_{vb} ≡ 0`. By (MC-13)(c) there are rigid `H₁ ∋ v, a` and `H₂ ∋ v, b`. Their union is rigid.
*Proof of the union lemma* (the second reader's):
- Let `P` partition `V₁ ∪ V₂` into `k` parts. Let `P₁ = P|_{V₁}`, with `t₁` parts.
- Let `P₂′` be `P|_{V₂}` with every part that meets `V₁` merged into one; it has `k − t₁ + 1`
  parts.
- An `H₂`-edge crossing `P₂′` has an endpoint outside `V₁`, so it is not an `H₁`-edge. Hence
  `d(P) ≥ d_{H₁}(P₁) + d_{H₂}(P₂′)`.
- So `val(P) ≤ val_{H₁}(P₁) + val_{H₂}(P₂′) ≤ 0`. One shared vertex suffices.
So the union contains `a` and `b`, which is excluded.
(The edge form checked by the driver is equivalent to the pair form stated. Use the union lemma,
and note that adding a degree-2 vertex to a rigid graph keeps it rigid.) Hence at least one of `ω_{va}`, `ω_{vb}` is not
identically zero. Only finitely many nonzero linear functionals on `F(q)` are involved, so
generic `z` avoids all their kernels, and (MC-12) gives conjunct 3.
**Only if.** If some `|closedHubNbhd v| ≥ 4`, (MC-12)(i) fails everywhere. Suppose instead that
`w₁, w₂ ∈ closedHubNbhd v` lie in a rigid `H`. Then `P_{w₁} = P_{w₂}` on all of `F(q)`, as in the
"if" half of (MC-13)(c). So their normals coincide, and conjunct 3 fails on all of `B`. (Linear dependence is a closed
condition holding on a dense subset of `B`.) ∎

**Checked** by `nondegx0.py` over every simple 2EC graph on ≤ 8 vertices (7 980 graphs, 121 208
edge checks), the battery and `θ(a, b, c)` with `a + b + c ≤ 10`. It uses one scale-30 admissible
`q` per graph. The (MC-13) equivalence is asserted edge by edge wherever that `q` and a drawn
`q_x` exhibit Jackson–Jordán's equality at `G` and at `G_e`; 12 edge checks at 1 graph were skipped
for that reason. The (MC-12)/(MC-14) prediction is asserted against `flanks.nondeg_conjuncts`, with
up to 4 drawn `z` per graph. On `exh8` the prediction and the observation agree at all 7 980
graphs: **7 934 predicted = 7 934 observed conjunct-3-degenerate on `X₀`**, which is the census's
own count in (MC-7)'s `exh8` row. Of these, 7 701 fail `hcard` and 233 pass `hcard` but have a rigid
hub pair (the census's 28 feasible A′ graphs are among the 233). Runs: `exh8` about 170 s;

> `HasGenericPencilRealization K 3 G` outright, without its split-off antecedent or its induction

*Proof of (i).* A `def₂`-rigid subgraph `H` with `V(H) ⊊ V(G)` is connected and `def₃`-rigid by
(MC-5)(i), so it is excluded. A subgraph spanning all of `V(G)` is **not** excluded by
`IsProperRigidSubgraph`, but it has `def₂(H) ≥ def₂(G)`, having fewer edges. So it suffices to
show `def₂(G) > 0`. Suppose `def₂(G) = 0`. For `X ⊊ V` let `c(X)` be
the number of edges leaving `X`.
- *Step 1.* `def₂(G[X]) ≤ 2c(X) − 3`. Add the single part `V ∖ X` to a partition of `X`.
- *Step 2.* If `def₂(H) ≤ 1`, then `H` is connected, and `def₃(H) = 0` iff `H` is bridgeless. From
  `2d(P) ≥ 3|P| − 4`: `6(|P| − 1) − 5d(P) ≤ (8 − 3|P|)/2 < 0` for `|P| ≥ 3`, and `|P| = 2` needs
  `d ≥ 2`.
- *Step 3.* Let `c(X) = 2` and `|X| ≥ 2`. Then `G[X]` has a bridge, else it would be a proper rigid
  subgraph. The bridge splits `X` into `X₁`, `X₂`. Since `G` is 2EC and
  `c(X₁) + c(X₂) = 2 + c(X) = 4`, both have `c(X_i) = 2`.
- *Step 4.* By induction on `|X|`, every vertex of such an `X` has degree 2 in `G`.
- *Step 5.* Apply this to `X = V ∖ {v}`, `v` of degree 2: `c(X) = 2`. So `G` is a cycle, and
  `def₂(C_n) = n − 3 = 0` forces `n = 3`, against `|V| ≥ 4`. ∎

(ii) is (i) with (MC-14): no rigid subgraph exists at all.

**Where this leaves the A′ exposure.** Under Jackson–Jordán it is now exactly the graphs with a
`def₂`-rigid subgraph containing two hubs of a common `closedHubNbhd` (MC-14). By (MC-15) that
set is disjoint from `hK`'s habitat; the census's "no A′ graph in `hK`'s habitat" is now a theorem
(mod Jackson–Jordán). **Residuals** (packaging (b)'s (K-res) habitat) have proper rigid subgraphs,
so (MC-15) does not reach them. For each residual, (MC-14) turns "nondegenerate on `X₀`" into a
finite check of `def₂`-rigid subgraphs; the census found all 260 nondegenerate.

#### Step MC10 — the ear step on `X₀` (P3 Track 1)

*Worked by a forked agent (2026-09-24) and checked by the coordinator; driver `w4/earstep.py`
(new). The question: does the `X₀` motive, "`X₀(G)`'s generic point attains `6(|V| − 1) − def₃(G)`",
propagate along an ear addition `G = G′ + ear_k`? Here `G′` satisfies (H). The ear has `k ≥ 1` new
vertices on a path `a − x₁ − ⋯ − x_k − b`. It is **open** if `a ≠ b`; **closed** if `a = b`, and then
`k ≥ 2`.*

**Notation.**
- `M_H`: the motion space of `H`'s body-hinge framework at the configuration in hand.
- `f := def₃(G′)` and `g := def₃(G′/ab)`, the maximum over partitions with `a, b` in one part.
- `δ := f − g ∈ [0, 6]`: smark's `δ_i`, smark brief §1.
- `ρ := {X_b − X_a : X ∈ M_{G′}}`, with `r := dim ρ`.
- `Λ`: the span of the ear's `k + 1` hinge lines, with `λ := dim Λ`.
- `U := {P_a − P_b : P ∈ F(G′, q′)}`: the 2D relative motion of `a, b` in the vertical block.
- The flag pair `(p_a, π_a; p_b, π_b)` with `p_a ≠ p_b` lies in one of four projective orbits:
  **(i)** `p_a ∉ π_b` and `p_b ∉ π_a`; **(ii)** exactly one of these incidences holds;
  **(iii)** both hold and `π_a ≠ π_b`, so `π_a ∩ π_b = p_a p_b`; **(iv)** `π_a = π_b`.

> **(MC-16)** `[PROVED]` *(the dimension formula, at every configuration)* For an open ear,
> `dim M_G = dim M_{G′} − r + dim(ρ ∩ Λ) + (k + 1) − λ`. For a closed ear,
> `dim M_G = dim M_{G′} + (k + 1) − λ`. Moreover `r ≤ δ` wherever `G′` attains.

*Proof.* Solving along the chain gives `X_{x_{i+1}} = X_{x_i} − ω_i C_i`, so the ear closes iff
`X_b − X_a ∈ Λ`. Given that, the ear's `ω` form an affine space of dimension `(k + 1) − λ`, and they
determine the ear bodies. The admissible `X` are the preimage of `ρ ∩ Λ` under the surjection
`M_{G′} → ρ`. For a closed ear, `X_b − X_a = 0`. For the bound, `r = dim M_{G′} − dim M_{G′,weld}`,
where `M_{G′,weld} = {X ∈ M_{G′} : X_a = X_b}` is the motion space of the framework on `G′/ab` with
the same hinge lines. Its dimension is at least `6 + g` by the partition bound. ∎

> **(MC-17)** `[PROVED]` *(the target)* `def₃(G) = f + k − 5` for an open ear with `k ≥ 5`;
> `f − min(δ, 5 − k)` for an open ear with `k ≤ 4`; and `f + max(0, k − 5)` for a closed ear.

*Proof.* Restrict a partition of `V(G)` to `V(G′)`. Suppose the ear path has `c` crossing edges.
Its middle segments are best made new parts, so the ear contributes `6(c − 1) − 5c = c − 6`.
- If `a, b` are separated, then `c ≥ 1`, and the best is `c = k + 1`, contributing `k − 5`.
- If `a, b` share a part, then `c = 0` or `c ≥ 2`, and the best is `max(0, k − 5)`.
So `def₃(G) = max(f_sep + k − 5, g + max(0, k − 5))`, where `f_sep` is the maximum over separating
partitions and `f = max(f_sep, g)`. Then split into cases:
- For `k ≥ 5` this is `f + k − 5`.
- For `k ≤ 4` with `f_sep ≥ g`, it is `f − min(δ, 5 − k)`.
- For `k ≤ 4` with `f_sep < g`, `δ = 0` and it is `f`.
- For a closed ear only the "same part" case occurs. ∎

In Tay's generic model, `λ = min(k + 1, 6)`, `r = δ` and `dim ρ ∩ Λ = max(0, r + λ − 6)`. With
these, (MC-16) reproduces (MC-17).

> **(MC-18)** `[PROVED]` *(dominance, corrected at `k = 1`)* **(a)** For `k ≥ 2`, and for closed ears,
> `L_G(q) ≅ L_{G′}(q′) × K^{k−2}` by `z_{x₁} = h_a(q_{x₁})`, `z_{x_k} = h_b(q_{x_k})`, with the middle
> heights free. So restriction `X₀(G) → X₀(G′)` is dominant, and the fibre is exactly the set of
> **placements**: `p_{x₁} ∈ π_a`, `p_{x_k} ∈ π_b`, middle points free. **(b)** For `k = 1`,
> `L_G(q) ≅ {z′ ∈ L_{G′}(q′) : (h_a − h_b)(q_x) = 0}`, and restriction is dominant **iff
> `dim U ≠ 1`** at generic `q′`.

*Proof of (b).* The incidence `{(z′, q_x) : (h_a − h_b)(q_x) = 0}` is the zero set of a form that is
linear in `z′` and affine in `q_x`. Its rank as a bilinear form is `dim U`.
- `U = 0`: the condition is vacuous.
- `dim U ≥ 2`: the form does not factor. Its zero set is then irreducible, has generic `q_x`, and
  dominates `L_{G′}`.
- `dim U = 1`, say `U = K·φ₀`: the zero set has two components of equal dimension,
  `K² × {P_a = P_b}` and `{φ₀ = 0} × L_{G′}`. `X₀(G)`, which has generic `q_x`, is the first, and
  lies over the proper locus `{P_a = P_b}`. ∎

Two instances of `dim U = 1`:
- `φ₀ ∝ ℓ_{ab}`: an edge or implied edge `ab`, the triangle case.
- `C₄ = a c b d` with `a, b` opposite: `P_a − P_b ∈ N_c^⊥ ∩ N_d^⊥ = K ℓ_{cd}`, and `G = K_{2,3}`.
  This is (MC-9)'s mechanism.

`[MEASURED earstep.py --rdelta 7]` `dim U = 1` occurs at 241 of the 11 573 vertex pairs of simple
2EC graphs on `≤ 7` vertices: 114 adjacent, 127 not. Each is at one draw, a lower bound on `dim U`.

> **(MC-19)** `[PROVED]` *(chain spans; `earstep.py --chains`, 16/16 certificates)* **(a)** A generic

> `λ = 2` in orbits (i), (ii), (iv), and `λ = 1` in (iii), where `p_x ∈ p_a p_b`. **(c)** For any
> flag, a generic closed-ear placement with `k ≥ 2` has `λ = min(k + 1, 6)`.

*Proof.* The placement space is irreducible (a product of planes and copies of `P³`), and rank is
lower semicontinuous on it. So one exhibited placement per projective orbit proves the generic
value.
- (b) with `π_a ≠ π_b`: choose `x₁ ∈ π_a` and `x_k ∈ π_b` with `p_a, x₁, x_k, p_b` not coplanar, and
  send them to `e₂, e₀, e₁, e₃`. The span then depends only on the free middle points, and one
  random choice has full rank.
- (b) with `π_a = π_b`: `p_a, x₁, x_k, p_b` are four general points of the common plane.
- (c): `p_a, x₁, x_k` are three general points of `π_a`.
- `n ≥ 7` and `k ≥ 6`: put the extra points on an existing hinge line of a spanning `n = 6` or
  `k = 5` configuration. The line set, and so the span, is unchanged, at a point of the closure. ∎

> **(MC-20)** `[PROVED]` *(the unconditional ear steps)* If `X₀(G′)` attains, then `X₀(G)` attains
> when the ear is **closed**, or **open with `k ≥ 5`**.

*Proof.* By (MC-18)(a), `X₀(G)`'s generic point lies over `X₀(G′)`'s, with a generic placement.
- Closed: by (MC-16) and (MC-19)(c), `dim M_G = 6 + f + (k + 1) − min(k + 1, 6)`, which is the
  target (MC-17).
- Open with `k ≥ 5`: `Λ = K⁶` by (MC-19)(b), so `ρ ∩ Λ = ρ` and `dim M_G = 6 + f + k − 5`.
Neither case uses `r`, `δ` or a placement condition. ∎

*Proof.* `X₀(C_n)` has no hubs, so `L = K^V`, and by (MC-19)(a)
`dim M = 6 + n − min(n, 6) = 6 + def₃(C_n)`. Then (a) follows by induction with (MC-20). For (b):
if `p₃ ≥ 6`, the θ-graph is `C_{p₁+p₂}` plus an open ear with `p₃ − 1 ≥ 5` interior vertices. If
`p₃ ≤ 5`, it is one of 30 graphs, each with an exhibited attaining `X₀` point
(`earstep.py --thetas 5`, mod-`2⁶¹ − 1` rank equal to the target). ∎

This extends (MC-7)'s finite `a + b + c ≤ 16` to every θ-graph. It is **characteristic-free
wherever (MC-19)'s certificates are**: they are exact over ℚ, so every prime not dividing their
minors is covered, and the remaining primes are not checked. Nondegeneracy is not claimed:
`θ(2,2,2) = K_{2,3}` stays A′ (MC-9), (MC-14).

> **(P_k)** the generic placement has `dim(ρ ∩ Λ) = max(0, r + k − 5)`.

*Proof.* By (MC-16) and (MC-17) we need `r − dim(ρ ∩ Λ) = min(δ, 5 − k)`. The left side is at most
`min(r, 5 − k)` and `r ≤ δ`, so equality forces (R_k). Given (R_k), equality holds iff
`dim(ρ ∩ Λ)` takes its least possible value, which is (P_k). ∎

**`r = δ` is a separate statement from "`G′` attains".** By (MC-16), `r = δ` iff the welded
framework on `G′/ab` attains at the pencil point. That framework's merged body carries two points

> `|V|`, the `k = 4` open-ear step holds**: (P₄) from this, (R₄) from (MC-24).

*Proof.* Here `λ = 5`. For `r ≥ 1`, (P₄) says that `ρ ⊄ Λ` for some placement, and that fails only
if `ρ ⊆ ⋂ Λ`. The exhibited intersection over 12 placements per orbit frame is already `0`, and
intersecting over more placements only shrinks it. ∎

> **(MC-26)** `[PROVED]` *(degeneration links)* For a given `ρ`: (P₁) ⟹ (P₂) at `r ≥ 4`, and
> (P₂) ⟹ (P₃) at `r ≥ 3`. (P_k) holds at `r = 1` for every `k ≤ 4`, except in the two cells where
> `⋂Λ ≠ 0`: orbit (iii) at `k = 1`, and orbit (iv) at `k = 2`.

*Proof.* For the first implication, degenerate the 2-ear to `x₁ ∈ π_a ∩ π_b` with `x₂` on the line
`x₁ p_b ⊆ π_b`. Its line set is then a 1-ear's, so the limit of `Λ₂` contains `Λ₁` plus one
dimension. Upper semicontinuity gives `dim ρ ∩ Λ₂ ≤ max(0, r − 4) + 1`, which is the (P₂) value
iff `r ≥ 4`. The second implication is the same, with `x₂` on the line `p_a x₁`. At `r = 1`,
(P_k) means `ρ ⊄ ⋂Λ` (`--lamcap`). ∎

Orbit (iv) is harmless on `X₀`. It is `P_a = P_b` at the generic point, i.e. `U = 0`. By the
argument of (MC-13), applied to `G′ + ab + x` with `x` adjacent to `a` and `b`, and assuming
Jackson–Jordán, `a` and `b` then lie in a common `def₂`-rigid subgraph. That subgraph is also
`def₃`-rigid, so `δ = 0` and `r = 0`.

> **(MC-27)** `[OPEN]` *(the open ear steps, `k = 1, 2, 3`)* At `X₀(G′)`'s generic point, `ρ` avoids
> the placement bad set `B_k(r) = {ρ : dim(ρ ∩ Λ) > max(0, r + k − 5) at every placement}`.
> **The universal form is false.** `Λ` always contains the line `p_a x₁`, which lies in the pencil
> `Pen(p_a, π_a)`. So every `ρ ⊇ Pen(p_a, π_a)` is bad when `r ≤ 5 − k`, and likewise for
> `Pen(p_b, π_b)`. Whether such `ρ` occur on `X₀` is open. They do not occur on `≤ 8` vertices:
> `exh8` attains everywhere (MC-7), which by (MC-22) forces (R_k) and (P_k).
> *`k = 1` in orbit (i), an exact criterion* `[PROVED]`. Put `m := π_a ∩ π_b` and `n := p_a p_b`,
> which are skew. Then `Λ(x) = x ⊗ n̂` inside `W₄ := m̂ ⊗ n̂`, the lines meeting both `m` and `n`. Put
> `ρ₄ := ρ ∩ W₄`. The 2-planes of `m̂ ⊗ n̂` meeting every `x ⊗ n̂` are exactly the `m̂ ⊗ y₀`. So (P₁)

> `ρ ⊇ W₄`.
> **Stop rule fired** (W4-reopen): the remaining cells split by `k` × orbit × `r`.

**What an ear-only induction on `X₀` still lacks.**
- Open ears with `k = 2, 3` need (P_k).
- (R₂) needs `dim U ≠ 1`.
- Open 1-ears need dominance, (R₁) and (P₁).
- Graphs of minimum degree `≥ 3` have no removable ear with an interior vertex, so they need a
  chord or contraction step, which the ear step does not supply.

  report form, EGRES TR-2006-06 (`.refs/`).
  - Thm 6.1 (TR p.14) and Thm 7.1 (p.21): simple graphs; the generic rank is
    `3|V| − 3 − def(G)`, with `def` exactly our `def₂` (p.7).
  - Thm 7.3: rigidity is equivalent to 2G packing 3 spanning trees.
  - p.21: the rod-and-pin 2-polymatroid **equals** the body-and-pin one, so the formula gives the
    rank of **every edge subset**. That is the form (MC-13)(c) and (MC-14) use, at `G_e` and at
    rigid subgraphs.
  - Setting: `ℝ²`, generic meaning algebraically independent over `ℚ`, with the genericity placed on
    the pin-lines, each pin being `L_u ∩ L_v`. This is exactly our dual picture: pin-line `L_v`
    dual to `q_v`, pin `ℓ_e`. The rank statement therefore transfers to generic points over any
    field of characteristic 0. Positive characteristic is not covered.
  - Proof technique: a minimal counterexample. The geometric steps are bar-joint 0-extensions,
    1-extensions and vertex splits on the body-and-pin graph; the combinatorics is the theory of
    bricks and superbricks.
