# Phase 22d — Claim 6.11's first green-machinery prerequisite (the matroid-base 4.3(ii) leaf) (work log)

**Status:** in progress. Opened 2026-06-05 design-pass-first; re-scoped 2026-06-05 to
attack KT Claim 6.11 **bottom-up** (build its leaf-most missing-green prerequisites, not
an axiomatized claim). Gap-2 leaf + Gap-3 combinatorial shell landed green 2026-06-06; the
footnote-6 recon (2026-06-06) settled the analytic kernel's shape; the kernel-route
decision (2026-06-06, user) is to build the algebraic-independence route directly. Recon
detail lives in the design doc (§1.30/§1.31); this note carries the forward plan + a
compressed verdict log.

## Current state

Both **combinatorial** factors of Claim 6.11 are green + axiom-clean (`ForestSurgery.lean`):
Gap-2 `Graph.splitOff_exists_base_inter_fiber_lt` (KT Lemma 4.3(ii) at `k=0` — a base `B'`
of `M(G̃_v^{ab})` with `|ãb ∩ B'| < D−1`) and Gap-3's combinatorial shell
`Graph.splitOff_removeVertex_minimalKDof` (`G_v = removeVertex v` is minimal `k'`-dof with
`0 ≤ k' = def(G̃_v) ≤ D−2`, via `subgraph_minimality` + the Gap-2 base count). Blueprint
nodes `lem:case-III-claim-6-11-base` + `lem:case-III-gap3-minimalKDof` green; `lem:case-III`
/ `lem:case-II-realization` red.

The analytic kernel's **rationality bridge (ii-b) is now green end to end.** The geometric leaf —
the `complementIso` change-of-basis matrix is rational — landed this commit (`Meet.lean`): the
diagonal wedge-pairing value `screwAlgebraTopEquiv (e_S ∨ₑ e_Sᶜ)` is `±1`
(`wedgePairing_ιMulti_family_mem_range_intCast`, via `ιMulti_family_mul_of_disjoint` = a
`permOfDisjoint`-signed top basis vector + `topEquiv_ιMulti_family_default`), off-diagonal `0`, so
the entry `repr (complementIso (e_S)) t` is integer/rational
(`complementIso_exteriorPower_repr_mem_range_{intCast,algebraMap}`). This propagates up the panel
polynomials (`PanelLayer.lean`: `normalsJoinPoly`/`panelSupportPoly`/`annihRowPoly`/device-`c`
`_mem_range_map`, carried as membership in the rational-coefficient subring
`(map (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)).range`), and the abstract device step
`exists_polynomial_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_at_coeffs_subset_range` (`Rank.lean`, with
`Matrix.det_mem_range_of_entries`) certifies the device's `Q` has `Q.coeffs ⊆ range (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)`
— exactly the open hypothesis the prior commit's assembly
(`eval_ne_zero_of_coeffs_subset_range_of_algebraicIndependent`) consumes. All axiom-clean.

**Next concrete commit:** **wire (ii-b) into the device's actual `Q`** — re-derive (or strengthen)
`PanelHingeFramework.exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn` (`GenericityDevice.lean`) through
`exists_polynomial_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_at_coeffs_subset_range` (in place of the bare
`exists_polynomial_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_at`), discharging its `hc` from
`annihRowPoly_smul_sign_mem_range_map` (the device's `c i j = ([u=a]−[v=a]) • annihRowPoly`), so the
produced `Q` carries `Q.coeffs ⊆ range (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)` alongside `eval q₀ Q ≠ 0`. Then **(iii)**
`lem:case-III-seed-rank-bridge` composes that rational `Q` + the assembly with the device consumer
(`isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_ofNormals_of_rankPolynomial_ne_zero`) + `rigidityMatrix_prop11` +
`rank_add_deficiency_eq`, and **(ii-a)** supplies the alg-indep-over-ℚ seed [the moment-curve
question, *Blockers*]. All built directly to green.

## Claim 6.11 discharge — the Gap 2 → 3 → 1 map

Claim 6.11 (KT p. 684, eq. (6.23)): `R(G_v^{ab}, q)` has a redundant row among its `D−1`
`ab`-rows — the `+1` that lifts 22c's stratum-1 `D(|V|−1)−1` brick to full `D(|V|−1)`.
KT's proof (pp. 684–685) factors, in dependency order:

1. **Gap 2 — matroid-base 4.3(ii)** (✓ landed): a base `B'` of `M(G̃_v^{ab})` with
   `h := |ãb ∩ B'| < D−1`. Pure combinatorial `M(G̃)`; all inputs green.
2. **Gap 3 — the nested IH-at-restriction.** `G_v := G_v^{ab} − ab = removeVertex v`;
   `B' ∖ ãb` independent in `M(G̃_v)` ⟹ `def(G̃_v) ≤ h ≤ D−2` ⟹ `G_v` minimal `k'`-dof.
   Apply the geometric IH (6.1) to `G_v` at the restricted seed `q|_{E_v}` ⟹
   `rank R(G_v, q|_{E_v}) = D(|V∖v|−1) − k'` (eq. (6.22)). **SPLIT (✓ shell):** the green
   combinatorial shell `splitOff_removeVertex_minimalKDof` (the `minimal k'-dof` step)
   landed; what remains is the analytic kernel (the eq. (6.22) rank-at-the-given-seed).
3. **Gap 1 — the `M(G̃)`↔row bridge.** With `rank R(G_v^{ab},q) = D(|V∖v|−1)` (eq. (6.18))
   and Gap 3's eq. (6.22), the `k' ≤ D−2 < D−1` corank over the `D−1` `ab`-rows forces one
   redundant (pigeonhole). Step ③ is pure LA *given* (6.18)+(6.22).

The kernels of Gaps 3 and 1 **likely merge into one node** — "the rigidity matrix at the
inductively-fixed seed `q` attains the rank `M(G̃)` predicts" — bottoming on the
`non-root-from-algebraic-independence` brick (open: confirm one-vs-two, *Blockers*).
eq. (6.18) is *not* separately in hand: 22c's `case_II_placement_eq612` gives the `−1`,
Claim 6.11 supplies the `+1` — the same missing content.

## Lemma checklist

- [x] `Graph.forest_surgery_count` — strengthened with the `|ãb ∩ ⋃ Fs'i| < D−1` conjunct
  (KT Lemma 4.1's second conclusion). Caller `forest_surgery_split` re-destructures.
- [x] `Graph.splitOff_exists_base_inter_fiber_lt` — Gap-2 leaf (above), green +
  axiom-clean. Node `lem:case-III-claim-6-11-base`.
- [x] `Graph.splitOff_removeVertex_minimalKDof` — Gap-3 combinatorial shell, green +
  axiom-clean: `G_v = removeVertex v` minimal `k'`-dof with `0 ≤ k' = def(G̃_v) ≤ D−2`.
  Minimality via `subgraph_minimality` (`G_v ≤ G`); bound via the Gap-2 base count
  (`B'∖ãb` indep in `M(G̃_v) = M(G̃_v^{ab})↾E(G̃_v)`, `rank ≥ |B'|−h`, def=corank). Did
  **not** need `removeVertex_deficiency_ge`. Node `lem:case-III-gap3-minimalKDof`.
- [x] `AlgebraicIndependent.aeval_ne_zero` — kernel leaf (i): an alg.-independent family `x` sends
  every nonzero `p : MvPolynomial ι R` to a nonzero `aeval x p` (contrapositive of mathlib's
  `eq_zero_of_aeval_eq_zero`). Upstream-eligible; mirrored at
  `Mathlib/RingTheory/AlgebraicIndependent/Defs.lean`, axiom-clean. The `R=ℚ`, `A=ℝ` instance is
  what footnote 6 needs (`q` real, rank-poly over ℚ); the same-ring `eval` form is vacuous (forces
  `ι` empty), so only the `aeval` form ships. No blueprint node yet (kernel `\lean{}` lands with (iii)).
- [x] `MvPolynomial.eval_map_algebraMap` / `map_algebraMap_ne_zero_iff` — (ii-b) leaf-most: the
  evaluation descent (`eval q (map (algebraMap R A) Q₀) = aeval q Q₀`, via `aeval_map_algebraMap` +
  `aeval_eq_eval`) and the nonzero transfer along a faithful `algebraMap`. Upstream-eligible,
  axiom-clean; mirrored at `Mathlib/RingTheory/MvPolynomial/Tower.lean`. No blueprint node (kernel
  `\lean{}` lands with (iii)).
- [x] `MvPolynomial.eval_ne_zero_of_coeffs_subset_range_of_algebraicIndependent` — (ii-b) consumed
  assembly (`Tower.lean`): nonzero `Q : MvPolynomial σ A` with `(Q.coeffs : Set A) ⊆ range
  (algebraMap R A)`, evaluated at `AlgebraicIndependent R`-seed `q`, is nonzero. Packages the descent
  pair + leaf (i) over mathlib's `mem_range_map_iff_coeffs_subset`. Axiom-clean. No blueprint node yet.
- [x] (ii-b) the `complementIso`-rational-entries leaf + propagation — **green this commit.**
  `Meet.lean`: `wedgePairing_ιMulti_family_mem_range_intCast` (the diagonal pairing is `±1` via
  `ιMulti_family_mul_of_disjoint` = signed top basis vector + `topEquiv_ιMulti_family_default`,
  off-diagonal `0`) ⟹ `complementIso_exteriorPower_repr_mem_range_{intCast,algebraMap}` (the
  matrix entry `repr (complementIso (e_S)) t` is rational). `PanelLayer.lean`:
  `{normalsJoinPoly,panelSupportPoly,annihRowPoly,annihRowPoly_smul_sign}_mem_range_map`
  propagate it as `(map (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)).range` membership. `Rank.lean`:
  `Matrix.det_mem_range_of_entries` + `exists_polynomial_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_at_coeffs_subset_range`
  certify `Q.coeffs ⊆ range (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)` from rational `c`. All axiom-clean. Mirror helper:
  `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti_family_congr` (cardinality cast). No blueprint node yet (kernel `\lean{}`
  lands with (iii)).
- [ ] **wire (ii-b) into the device `Q`** (next build) — strengthen
  `PanelHingeFramework.exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn` (`GenericityDevice.lean`) to route through
  the rational device lemma, discharging `hc` from `annihRowPoly_smul_sign_mem_range_map`, so the
  produced `Q` carries `Q.coeffs ⊆ range (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)`.
- [ ] (ii-a) seed-genericity motive conjunct (carry "realizing seed alg-indep over ℚ"; 22b-shaped)
  — waits on the moment-curve alg-independence question (*Blockers*).
- [ ] (iii) `lem:case-III-seed-rank-bridge` (= the eq. (6.22) generic-rank transfer ⊕ Gap-1 row
  bridge) composing (i) ⊕ (ii-a) ⊕ (ii-b)'s rational `Q` with the device consumer
  (`isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_ofNormals_of_rankPolynomial_ne_zero`) + `rigidityMatrix_prop11`. Red;
  built directly, not carried.

## Deferred sub-phases (future work in the phase)

Parked until the leaf's shape is clear; a sub-letter is minted when its turn comes.

- **The analytic kernel (Gap-3 kernel ⊕ Gap-1 row bridge — likely ONE node).** Payload:
  `corank R(ofNormals G_v ends q|_{E_v}) = def(G̃_v)` at the inductively-fixed seed `q`,
  then the redundant-row conversion (eq. (6.23)). The footnote-6 recon (design doc §1.30)
  pinned the content: the device *consumer*
  `isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_ofNormals_of_rankPolynomial_ne_zero` already runs the
  given-point direction, so the only gap is certifying `eval q Q ≠ 0` for the specific
  device-built `Q` — which KT gets from `q` being **algebraically independent over ℚ**
  (footnote 6). The project had **zero** `AlgebraicIndependent` machinery. Cut (refined by the
  (ii) opening recon, *Kernel sub-phase (ii) recon*; design doc §1.32): **(i)** [✓ landed]
  `AlgebraicIndependent.aeval_ne_zero` (alg.-indep. tuple ⟹ `aeval`-non-root of every nonzero
  ℚ-poly; mirror); **(ii)** SPLITS — **(ii-a)** seed-genericity motive conjunct (carry "realizing
  seed alg-indep over ℚ"; a third motive form paralleling 22b's GP / link-recording), waiting on
  the moment-curve alg-independence question; **(ii-b)** [✓ landed] the rationality bridge — the
  device's `Q : MvPolynomial σ ℝ` is rational (`Q.coeffs ⊆ range (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)`), via the
  geometric `complementIso`-entry leaf + the panel-polynomial propagation + the rational device
  lemma (see *Current state*); **(iii)** the kernel `lem:case-III-seed-rank-bridge` composing
  (i) ⊕ (ii-a) ⊕ (ii-b)'s rational `Q` with the consumer + `rigidityMatrix_prop11` +
  `rank_add_deficiency_eq`. **Route (user,
  2026-06-06, design doc §1.31): build this DIRECTLY to green**, not as a permanent
  hypothesis. The product-route *relaxation* candidate (pick `q` as a non-root of the
  finite product of the nested IH rank polynomials, avoiding alg-independence at `d=3`;
  ~70% confidence) is the deferred TODO in the standing tracker
  `notes/AlgebraicIndependence.md`.
- **Candidate-completion + Claim 6.12 disjunction.** With the redundant `ab`-row, lift
  22c's `case_II_placement_eq612` `≥ D(|V|−1)−1` to `= D(|V|−1)` on one candidate (eq.
  (6.24)–(6.29) row-op), then the Claim-6.12 extensor-span contradiction via the **green**
  Lemma 2.1 (`omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent`) + the eq. (6.44) degree-2 forcing picks
  the full-rank candidate. Claim 6.12 **de-risked** (Lemma 2.1 green). Candidate normal
  form: **abstract one per-candidate lemma, instantiate ×3** (`p₂=p₁` with `a↔b`;
  `p₃=p₁∘ρ`); `case_II_placement_eq612` is already this shape (22c recon, design doc §1.26).
- **The `d=3` assembly** — `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` `hub` brick + `thm:theorem-55`
  flip + wiring the green `case_I_realization`. Unlettered.
- **General `d`** (Lemma 6.13) → Thm 5.5 → Thm 5.6 → Conjecture 1.2 — Phase 23.

## Blockers / open questions

- **Is the inductive seed provably alg-indep over ℚ?** (ii-a)'s motive conjunct needs a
  *concrete* alg-indep seed for the producers to build at. The moment-curve seed
  (`withMomentNormals`) is the natural candidate — **confirm it is provably alg-indep over ℚ,
  or substitute a transcendental basis** (open; the (ii-a) build's first question).
- **Do the Gap-3 kernel and Gap-1 row bridge merge into one node?** Both bottom on "the
  seed attains the rank `M(G̃)` predicts". Confirm one-vs-two when (iii) is scheduled.
- **Claim 6.12 — de-risked** (bottoms on the green Lemma 2.1).
- **Recurring Lean traps** (carry from 22a–c, FRICTION): heavy `IsInfinitesimallyRigidOn`
  defeq across `ofNormals`/`withGraph` graph-swaps can `isDefEq`-timeout — make the two
  frameworks *syntactically* equal before `convert`; transfer rigidity via a
  `mem_infinitesimalMotions` round-trip. (Bites once Gap 1 lands, not the matroid-only shell.)

## Hand-off / next phase

**Next concrete commit:** the (ii-b) rationality bridge landed green end to end this commit — the
geometric `complementIso`-entry leaf (`Meet.lean`), the panel-polynomial propagation
(`PanelLayer.lean`), and the abstract rational device lemma + `det`-closure (`Rank.lean`); see
*Current state* / *Lemma checklist*. The next **build** commit is **wiring (ii-b) into the device's
actual `Q`**: strengthen `PanelHingeFramework.exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn`
(`GenericityDevice.lean`) to route through
`exists_polynomial_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_at_coeffs_subset_range` instead of the bare
`exists_polynomial_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_at`, discharging the new `hc` hypothesis from
`annihRowPoly_smul_sign_mem_range_map` (the device's `c i j = ([u=a]−[v=a]) • annihRowPoly`), so the
produced `Q` additionally carries `Q.coeffs ⊆ range (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)`. Then **(ii-a)** [waits on the
moment-curve alg-independence question, *Blockers*], then **(iii)** `lem:case-III-seed-rank-bridge`
composing (i) ⊕ (ii-a) ⊕ (ii-b)'s rational `Q` with the device consumer
(`isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_ofNormals_of_rankPolynomial_ne_zero`) + `rigidityMatrix_prop11` +
`rank_add_deficiency_eq`. The two combinatorial Claim-6.11 factors (Gap-2 leaf + Gap-3 shell) are
green; `lem:case-III` stays red until the kernel lands.

After the kernel: the candidate-completion + Claim-6.12 disjunction, the `d=3` assembly, and
general-`d` (Phase 23).

KT math: KT §6.4.1 (Lemma 6.10, Claims 6.11/6.12, eqs. (6.22)–(6.45)), §4 (Lemmas
4.3(ii)/4.4/4.7/4.8). Recon detail: design doc §1.30 (footnote-6 kernel) + §1.31
(kernel-route) + §1.26 (candidate structure); also `notes/Phase20.md`
(`splitOff_isMinimalKDof`), `notes/Phase21b.md` *Finding A/B*, `notes/Phase22c.md`,
`notes/AlgebraicIndependence.md` (the alg-independence tracker).

## Decisions & recon log (compressed)

The finished-work tail — one-line verdicts; the blow-by-blow is in the cited commits /
design-doc arcs (per `notes/CLAUDE.md` *Forward-weighted note*).

- **Re-scope (2026-06-05).** User overrode the opening "axiomatize Claim 6.11" verdict
  (commit 4e6a7bb): build Claim 6.11's leaf-most missing prerequisite bottom-up rather
  than deferring onto Claim 6.12.
- **Green substrate richer than the opening recon credited.** Gap 2 is buildable from green
  Phase-20 infra — `splitOff_isMinimalKDof`'s proof already builds the `ãb`-base count (and
  discarded it); `isBase_vfiber_ncard_ge` is a near-verbatim template. (Detail in the Gap-2
  leaf's proof + commit 13d2464.)
- **Gap-2 leaf (commit 13d2464).** Two bricks: (1) strengthen `forest_surgery_count` with
  the `< D−1` conjunct (the inserted `r i` are the only `e₀`-copies, `h' ≤ D−2`); (2) the
  `k=0` base assembly (`def = 0` ⟹ a full-rank independent set is a base,
  `Indep.isBase_of_ncard`). KT 4.3(ii) is an **existence** statement (a base with `<D−1`),
  not "every base" — matching the Claim-6.11 use.
- **Gap-3 recon (commit 0f7ef2a).** Gap 3 **splits**: green combinatorial shell
  + research-shaped analytic kernel; the combinatorial glue (`def(G̃_v) ≤ h` ⟹ `G_v`
  minimal `k'`-dof) is all green Phase-19/20.
- **Gap-3 shell (commit d218fa0).** `splitOff_removeVertex_minimalKDof` green: minimality via
  `subgraph_minimality` (`G_v ≤ G`), bound via the Gap-2 base (`B'∖ãb` indep in the
  restriction `M(G̃_v) = M(G̃_v^{ab})↾E(G̃_v)`, so `rank ≥ |B'|−h`; def=corank at `def=0`
  gives `def(G̃_v) ≤ h < D−1`). The route did **not** need `removeVertex_deficiency_ge` (the
  splitting-off side carries the count). `isBase_vfiber_ncard_ge` was the structural template.
- **Footnote-6 kernel recon (commit 892f44c; design doc §1.30).** eq. (6.22) is NOT a green
  re-exposure of 21b/22b machinery. Confirmed two of the user's three structural claims
  (matroid↔row link = the IH `rigidityMatrix_prop11`, green-modulo; step ③ pure LA);
  refuted the bottom line — the motive is existence-only (`∃ Q`), `IsGeneralPosition` is
  only pairwise transversality, not non-root-ness of `Q`. Named the missing brick:
  `non-root-from-algebraic-independence`.
- **Kernel-route decision (commit 3f0ea8e; design doc §1.31).** Build the alg-independence
  route directly to green (the certain path); product-route relaxation tracked in
  `notes/AlgebraicIndependence.md`.
- **Kernel leaf (i) (commit fb635d9).** `AlgebraicIndependent.aeval_ne_zero` — one-line
  contrapositive of mathlib's `eq_zero_of_aeval_eq_zero`, mirrored under
  `Mathlib/RingTheory/AlgebraicIndependent/`; the `R=ℚ`, `A=ℝ` footnote-6 instance ships (the
  same-ring `eval` form is vacuous). Wired into the root aggregator as a leaf awaiting (iii).
- **Kernel (ii-b) descent mirror (commit b21b239).** `MvPolynomial.eval_map_algebraMap` (`eval q
  (map (algebraMap R A) Q₀) = aeval q Q₀` — `aeval_map_algebraMap` at the self-tower `A=B` through
  `aeval_eq_eval`) + `map_algebraMap_ne_zero_iff` (nonzero transfer via the injective faithful
  `algebraMap`). All pieces already in mathlib; the leaf packages them in the consumed form. Mirrored
  at `Mathlib/RingTheory/MvPolynomial/Tower.lean`, axiom-clean. A true leaf — no geometry; FRICTION
  *[mirrored]* entry filed.
- **Kernel (ii-b) consumed assembly (commit 58cfd93).**
  `MvPolynomial.eval_ne_zero_of_coeffs_subset_range_of_algebraicIndependent` (`Tower.lean`) — the
  shape (iii) fires: nonzero `Q` with `coeffs ⊆ range (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)` at an `AlgebraicIndependent ℚ`
  seed is `eval`-nonzero. The "coeffs in range ⟹ `Q = map (algebraMap) Q₀`" descent was already in
  mathlib (`mem_range_map_iff_coeffs_subset`, *found by search, not re-mirrored*), so the assembly is
  3 lines over it + the descent pair + leaf (i). Axiom-clean.
- **Kernel (ii-b) rationality leaf + propagation (this commit).** The geometric crux: the
  `complementIso` change-of-basis matrix is rational. Diagonal wedge-pairing value `= ±1` via
  mathlib's `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti_family_mul_of_disjoint` (the product of two complementary
  standard basis vectors is a `permOfDisjoint`-signed top basis vector) + `topEquiv_…_default`;
  off-diagonal `0`. The cardinality cast `j+(k+2−j) → k+2` needed a mirror helper
  `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti_family_congr` (subst-able `m=n` + `Subtype.ext`; QUIRKS § 36). Propagated
  as `(map (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)).range` membership (GOLF § 14) up `normalsJoinPoly → panelSupportPoly →
  annihRowPoly → c`, then `Rank.lean`'s `Matrix.det_mem_range_of_entries` +
  `exists_polynomial_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_at_coeffs_subset_range` certify
  `Q.coeffs ⊆ range`. Three mirror entries filed (FRICTION *[mirrored]*). Axiom-clean. Route (b2)
  (post-hoc descent on the ℝ-polynomial) confirmed correct — no device re-typing needed.
- **Kernel sub-phase (ii) recon (commit 7202bfd; design doc §1.32).** The math-first recon at the
  (ii) open: traced what (iii) must compose against the *real* device signatures. **(ii) splits.**
  (ii-a) = a seed-genericity motive conjunct (carry "realizing seed alg-indep over ℚ"; 22b-shaped,
  the anticipated third motive form). (ii-b) = a *rationality bridge* the §1.30 cut missed: leaf (i)
  needs the rank polynomial over **ℚ**, but the device builds `Q : MvPolynomial σ ℝ` (its
  `panelSupportPoly` coefficients are ℝ-typed `complementIso` constants — rational but not
  manifestly so; zero `algebraMap ℚ ℝ` scaffolding tree-wide), so `Q` must be exhibited as an
  `algebraMap ℚ ℝ`-image. Next build = (ii-b)'s upstream-eligible `eval = aeval ∘ descend` mirror.
- **22c left off** at `case_II_placement_eq612` (`CaseI.lean:2331`) = the `≥ D(|V|−1)−1`
  brick; its `e_a=va` link is carried as `_hG_ea`. 22d supplies the `+1`.
