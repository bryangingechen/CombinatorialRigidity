# Phase 23 — Case III general `d` (KT Lemma 6.13): general design recon

**Status:** live design recon (decision-support doc). This is the *general,
layer-level* sub-phase-division recon for Phase 23 — the first stage of a
two-stage recon (a later dispatch does the leaf-level recon of the FIRST
sub-phase before any build). It sketches the cut-points, their dependency
order, hard cores, and the reuse/replace/add map; it does **not** attempt
full leaf-level signatures for every sub-phase. Authoritative recon for
Phase 23; `notes/Phase23a.md` / `notes/Phase23b.md` are the per-layer work logs
and point here. **Detailed leaf-level recons done so far:** §"23a" (CARRIER,
closed) and §"CHAIN — detailed leaf-level recon" (the minted **23b**, open
2026-06-17 — decides OD-6/OD-7, flags OD-4 + the producer-shape mismatch (b)).

**Audience:** the agent opening the first Phase-23 sub-phase (and the
detailed-recon dispatch that decomposes it into buildable leaves).

**Source-verified, 2026-06-17.** Every load-bearing claim below was checked
against (i) the KT paper directly — §6.4.2 Lemma 6.13, eqs. (6.46)–(6.67),
cross-read against §6.4.1 (the `d=3` Lemma 6.10 it generalizes), §4 (Lemmas
4.6/4.8/4.9), §5.1–5.2 (Lemmas 5.1–5.4, Theorems 5.5/5.6) — and (ii) the
actual landed `def`/`theorem` in tree (grade, conclusion shape). The KT
read corrected several §1.33(C) sketch cells; the corrections are flagged
inline and in *Open decisions*.

## 0. What Phase 23 is, in one paragraph

KT prove Theorem 5.5 (every minimal `k`-dof-graph has a panel-hinge
realization at rank `D(|V|−1)−k`) by induction on `|V|`, four cases. Three
cases (base, not-2-edge-connected, proper-rigid-subgraph = Case I, `k>0`
split = Case II) are dimension-general and already green in the
**`screwDim 2` / `ScrewSpace 2` / `Fin 4`-pinned** `d=3` spine. The fourth,
**Case III** (`k=0`, 2-edge-connected, no proper rigid subgraph; KT §6.4),
is the crux, and is the only case whose **argument** is currently written
`d=3`-specific: KT §6.4.1 (Lemma 6.10) does it with a *fixed* 3-candidate
dispatch (vertices `v,a,b,c`), and §6.4.2 (Lemma 6.13) generalizes it to a
length-`d` chain `v₀v₁…v_d` with `d` candidate frameworks `(G,pᵢ)` and
isomorphisms `ρᵢ`. KT, p. 692: *"The proof strategy is exactly the same as
`d = 3`."* The mathematical heart of Phase 23 is **two things**: (a) lift
the whole `screwDim 2`-pinned spine to general `screwDim k`, and (b) replace
the `d=3` Case-III dispatch with the general-`d` chain dispatch + the
`⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})` duality finish. Then complete Theorem 5.5 (general `d`),
derive Theorem 5.6 (KT §5.2 strip + projective-move-free re-add), and state
Conjecture 1.2 as a theorem.

KT's general-`d` proof, **verbatim from p. 692** (the load-bearing claim
this recon rests on): *"By Lemma 4.6, either `G` is a cycle of length at
most `d` or `G` has a chain of length `d`. If `G` is a cycle of length at
most `d`, then we are done by Lemma 5.4. Hence, let us consider the case
where `G` has a chain `v₀v₁v₂…v_d` of length `d` (where `d_G(vᵢ)=2` for
`1≤i≤d−1`)."* So the **chain entry is a genuine new dichotomy** (Lemma 4.6),
the **short-cycle base is genuinely needed** (Lemma 5.4), and the chain
interior split is **Lemma 4.8**. None of these three appear `d=3` because
`d=3` runs a fixed 3-chain `v→a→b→c` and never invokes 4.6/4.8/5.4 on the
load-bearing path (see Open decision OD-1, OD-2).

## 1. The carrier-grade fault line — the single biggest scoping fact

§1.33(C)'s row *"genericity device, prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11,
theorem_55 skeleton, Cases I & II — general & GREEN — the spine is `k`-free"*
is **wrong about the spine**, and this is the recon's most consequential
correction. The graph-side combinatorics is `n`-parametric, but the
**realization spine carries `screwDim 2` / `ScrewSpace 2` / `Fin 4`
literally**. Source-verified grades of the spine decls (the table names
them at general grade; the tree pins them at `d=3`):

| Decl | File | Grade as landed | Phase-23 action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `theorem_55_all_k`, `theorem_55_d3` | `AlgebraicInduction/Theorem55.lean:2248/2266` | `HasGenericFullRankRealization 2 n`, `hn : bodyBarDim n = screwDim 2` — **`d=3`-pinned** | re-state at `screwDim k` motive |
| `case_III_realization`, `case_III_realization_0dof` | `CaseIII/Realization.lean:665/518` | `HasGenericFullRankRealization 2 n`, `screwDim 2` — **`d=3`-pinned** | re-state at `screwDim k` |
| `case_III_nested_rank_lower` | `CaseIII/Realization.lean:561` | `q : α × Fin 4 → ℝ`, `screwDim 2` — **`d=3`-pinned**; *already consumes* `AlgebraicIndependent ℚ q` | re-state at `Fin (k+2)` / `screwDim k` |
| `case_III_candidate_dispatch` | `CaseIII/Realization.lean:181` | `q : α × Fin 4 → ℝ`, fixed `v,a,b,c` 3-candidate, `screwDim 2`, `h622lb` over `Fin 4` — **`d=3`-pinned AND structurally fixed-3-candidate** | **REPLACE** by the chain dispatch |
| `case_II_placement_eq612` | `AlgebraicInduction/CaseII.lean:71` | `screwDim k`-stated already? (check) | confirm grade in detailed recon |

**Two distinct lifts are bundled in the table's one "spine" row.** (i) A
*mechanical carrier lift* — re-state the `screwDim 2`-pinned spine decls
(`theorem_55_*`, `case_III_realization*`) at `screwDim k`; their *proofs*
compose general-grade bricks, so this is plumbing once the carrier API is
general. (ii) A *genuinely new argument* — `case_III_candidate_dispatch`
is not merely `d=3`-graded but **structurally a fixed 3-candidate dispatch**
(`v,a,b,c`, `e_a,e_b,e_c`), which is exactly KT's §6.4.1; the general-`d`
Lemma 6.13 replaces it with the `d`-candidate chain dispatch (eqs.
6.46–6.67). The recon's sub-phase cut runs **along this fault line**.

**The general-`d` carrier API (ScrewSpaceCarrier §6) is a prerequisite for
both.** The opaque `ScrewSpace k` `def` landed (22l) with a general-`k`
`mk`/`val`/`equivExteriorPower`/instance API (`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`),
but every *consumer* in the spine was migrated at `k=2` only. The
general-`d` "part 2" (ScrewSpaceCarrier-design.md §6) is the migration of
those consumers to symbolic `k` — and §6 flags the real unknown: at `k=2`,
`screwDim 2 = 6` is concrete and many proofs lean on `fin_cases`/`decide`;
at general `k`, `screwDim k = (k+2).choose 2` is symbolic and the
`screwBasis`/`annihRow` coordinate machinery (hard-part (d)) gets exercised
symbolically for the first time. **This recon folds the general-`d`
carrier-API work into sub-phase 23a (below), not a standalone sub-phase** —
the migration surface *is* the carrier-lift surface, and §6's whole point
was to shape the API against the general-`d` usage rather than freeze it
speculatively.

---

## 2. The sub-phase division

Four layers, dependency-ordered, tracked by **stable codes** —
**`CARRIER`**, **`CHAIN`**, **`ENTRY`**, **`ASSEMBLY`**. The cut isolates the
**mechanical carrier lift** (`CARRIER`) from the **new chain argument**
(`CHAIN`), puts the **base ingredients** the chain entry needs (`ENTRY`) where
they actually block, and ends with **assembly + Thm 5.6 + Conjecture 1.2**
(`ASSEMBLY`). The first layer is `CARRIER`; rationale in §3.

> **Naming convention (set 2026-06-17).** Layers are referred to by these
> codes until they open; a **letter (23a, 23b, …) plus a `notes/Phase23X.md`
> work log are minted only when a layer is about to open**, so a later split
> (e.g. `CHAIN` into two) does not renumber-churn the rest. **`CARRIER` is the
> opening layer = the minted `23a`** (its leaf-level recon is §"23a" below, its
> work log is `notes/Phase23a.md`); `CHAIN`/`ENTRY`/`ASSEMBLY` stay code-only
> until their turn. This is the project's standing "mint a sub-letter only when
> its turn comes" discipline (`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`; top-level
> `CLAUDE.md` *When this commit opens a phase*), refined to use codes meanwhile.

### `CARRIER` (the opening layer = sub-phase 23a) — General-`d` carrier lift of the spine

**Scope.** Lift the `screwDim 2`/`ScrewSpace 2`/`Fin 4`-pinned realization
spine to symbolic `screwDim k`, and complete the ScrewSpaceCarrier §6
general-`d` consumer migration in step. This is the carrier-API "part 2"
the 22l refactor unblocked but deferred. Concretely: re-state
`theorem_55_all_k` / `theorem_55_d3` (→ a general `theorem_55` at the
`screwDim k` motive), `case_III_realization` / `_0dof` /
`case_III_nested_rank_lower`, the `case_II_*` placement bricks, and the
GenericityDevice / Coupling / CaseI consumers, replacing `Fin 4` →
`Fin (k+2)`, `screwDim 2` → `screwDim k`, `HasGenericFullRankRealization 2`
→ `… k`, and re-greening each file along the import spine
(RigidityMatrix → PanelLayer → Pinning → PanelHinge → GenericityDevice →
Coupling → CaseI → CaseII → CaseIII → Theorem55). The Case-III *graph
dispatch* (`case_III_candidate_dispatch`) is **out of 23a scope** — it is
replaced wholesale in CHAIN, so 23a leaves the Case-III `hsplit` arm carrying
the `d=3` dispatch as an explicit hypothesis (green-modulo, the project's
standing idiom) and lifts everything else.

**Hard core.** The symbolic-`k` stress on the `screwBasis`/`annihRow`
coordinate machinery (ScrewSpaceCarrier §6, hard-part (d)) and on the
`screwDim k = (k+2).choose 2` arithmetic that `d=3` discharged by `decide`.
Not deep mathematics — but the *largest* mechanical surface in Phase 23, and
the one most likely to surface a needs-thought transport (per §6, the
general-`k` coordinate transport is unproven at symbolic grade; the d=3
probe found it defeq-free at `k=2` only).

**Dependency position.** First — everything downstream is stated over the
carrier, so the chain dispatch (CHAIN) and the duality (also CHAIN) must be
written at general grade, which presupposes the spine is general grade.

**Reuse/replace/add map** (keyed to §1.33(C), source-corrected):
- *Reuse verbatim, already general & GREEN:* Lemma 2.1
  `omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent_of_li` (`Extensor.lean:563`, `{e:ℕ}`),
  Claim 6.11 `exists_redundant_panelRow_ab_of_finrank_eq`
  (`CaseIII/Candidate.lean:126`, `screwDim k`/`ScrewSpace k`/`Fin (k+2)` —
  **verified general**), `linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow`
  (`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean:1231`, `ScrewSpace k`, graph-free), the
  `complementIso`/`topEquiv`/`pairingDualEquiv` meet API (`Meet.lean`,
  `{j:ℕ} (hj : j ≤ k+2)` — dimension-parametric).
- *Re-state at general grade (lift, this sub-phase):* the spine table in §1.
- *Add:* the general-`k` consumer migration (ScrewSpaceCarrier §6).

### CHAIN — The general-`d` Case-III chain dispatch + the `⋀^{d−1}` duality

**Scope.** Replace the fixed-3-candidate `case_III_candidate_dispatch` with
the general-`d` chain dispatch of Lemma 6.13: given the base framework
`(G₁,q₁)` on the chain-split `G₁` and the isos `ρᵢ` (eq. 6.54), build the
`d` candidate frameworks `(G,p₀),…,(G,p_{d−1})` (eqs. 6.47/6.48/6.57/6.59),
do the matrix bookkeeping (eqs. 6.49–6.64) that embeds `R(G₁,q₁)` as a
submatrix and reduces each `R(G,pᵢ)` to a top-left `D×D` block `Mᵢ` plus
`R(G₁∖(v₀v₂)_{i*}, q₁)`, establish the "±r chain" (eq. 6.66) so each `Mᵢ`
fails full rank iff `r ⊥ C(Lᵢ)`, and finish via the `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})`
duality + Lemma 2.1 (eq. 6.67): take `d+1` points `p₀…p_d` (one per panel
incidence pattern), whose `(d−1)`-extensors of `d−1`-subsets span a
`(d+1 choose d−1) = D`-dimensional space, forcing some `Mᵢ` to have full
rank.

**Scope expansion (23a Leaf-5 build-contact finding — corrects §"23a"(a)/(d)
and §1).** The recon assumed the realization spine was "general & GREEN" modulo
*only* this chain dispatch. False: lifting the spine (23a Leaf 5,
`theorem_55_minimalKDof_k_all_k`) found that the **base / cut / Case-I / M4-
forgetful-map** realization producers — `theorem_55_base_producer`,
`case_cut_edge_realization{,_gp}`, `case_I_dispatch` (+ `case_I_realization_h65`),
and `hasPanelRealization_of_generic` — are **also `d=3`-pinned**: each bottoms
out in `Fin 4` panel geometry and the `⋀²ℝ⁴` duality
`exists_extensor_eq_panelSupportExtensor` (the forget map provably calls it,
`GenericityDevice.lean:1936/1945`; every conditioned-pair producer routes
through the forget map for its bare `HasPanelRealization` half). They are **not**
liftable by 23a's numeral pass (unlike the inductive CaseII/CaseIII arms, which
transport the IH realization additively). 23a therefore carries them as four
further explicit `h…` hypotheses (`hbase_k`/`hcut_k`/`hcontract_k`/`hforget_k`,
all green-modulo, never `sorry`; the `d=3` wrapper fills them zero-carry). **So
CHAIN's `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})` duality is the prerequisite to lift these four
producers off `Fin 4`** — that lift is added to CHAIN's deliverables (**OD-7
decided 2026-06-17: fold into CHAIN's tail after the duality CHAIN-3, not a
dedicated successor — they are a direct corollary of the duality lift; caveat
flagged in §"CHAIN — detailed leaf-level recon" (e)**), on top of the chain
dispatch below. Detail: `notes/Phase23a.md` *Hand-off* + Leaf-5 *Decisions*
entry; the leaf plan + the producer-shape flag (b) are §"CHAIN — detailed
leaf-level recon".

**Hard core.** Two parts, both genuinely new:
1. **The `d`-fold chain bookkeeping (eqs. 6.59–6.64).** Index-heavy but
   KT calls it "exactly the same as `d=3`." The reusable graph-free
   `linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow` augments by **one** Unit
   candidate; the chain needs `d` candidates indexed `0…d−1`, so this is
   the augment generalized to a `d`-fold `Sum`/`Fin d`-indexed family +
   the row-correspondence eq. (6.62)/(6.66) along the chain. The
   `case_III_candidate_dispatch` body (a fixed `v,a,b,c` term, ~hundreds of
   lines) is the `d=3` template to generalize.
2. **The `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})` duality (the N3b analog).** Replaces the
   bespoke `⋀²ℝ⁴` route. Per §1.33(D) (source-confirmed): do **NOT** build
   a general Hodge-star / regressive-product / star-operator API — KT never
   needs it; the whole content is "the join of `d−1` points spanning a
   `(d−2)`-flat = the meet of the panels containing it, as the same Plücker
   line," which is the **top-power-is-1-dimensional** fact. The route that
   generalizes is the 22f "happy accident":
   `extensor_mem_range_map_subtype_of_mem` +
   `exists_smul_eq_of_mem_range_map_subtype` (`Meet.lean:648/676`) — place
   both members in `range(exteriorPower.map (d−1) W.subtype)`, which is
   `(W choose d−1)`-dim. **Source-verified nuance / correction to (D):**
   those two lemmas as landed are **`Fin 4`/`⋀²`-PINNED**
   (`W : Submodule ℝ (Fin 4 → ℝ)`, `⋀[ℝ]^2`, `finrank_exteriorPower_two_eq_one`).
   The *route* generalizes (it rests on general mathlib —
   `exteriorPower.finrank_eq`, `exteriorPower.map_injective_field`,
   `map_apply_ιMulti` + the general `topEquiv`/`pairingDualEquiv` mirrors),
   but the lemmas themselves must be **re-stated** at `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})`
   with the general `finrank (⋀^{d−1} W) = (dim W choose d−1)`. This is
   "modest, mostly-mathlib API at concrete grade," not a verbatim reuse —
   the (D) cell "ALREADY PARTLY LANDED" is true only as a *template*.

**Dependency position.** After 23a (needs the general-grade carrier + spine
to state its conclusion `HasGenericFullRankRealization k n G`). **OD-6 decided
at the CHAIN open (23b, 2026-06-17): five leaves within ONE sub-phase** (the
arm-realization engine they feed is already general-`k`, so neither hard core
stands alone as a deliverable; split at contact only if the chain bookkeeping
proves larger than estimated). The detailed leaf plan + the load-bearing
producer-shape flag are §"CHAIN — detailed leaf-level recon" below.

**Reuse/replace/add map:**
- *Reuse verbatim:* Claim 6.11 (the chain's redundant `(v₀v₂)_{i*}` row is
  "always exists by Claim 6.11," KT p. 693), Lemma 2.1 (the eq. 6.67
  span-`D` finish, KT p. 698).
- *Replace:* `case_III_candidate_dispatch` (fixed-3 → `d`-chain); the
  `⋀²ℝ⁴` N3b leaf (`complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join`,
  `exteriorPower_basis_toDual_eq_pairingDual_comp_map`, both `Fin 4`-pinned
  in `Meet.lean`) → `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})`.
- *Add:* the `d`-fold candidate augment; the chain row-correspondence
  (eq. 6.62), the ±r chain (eq. 6.66); the `d+1`-points-in-general-position
  construction (eq. 6.67) — a **new algebraic-independence site** (the
  panel coefficients are alg-indep over ℚ so any `j` hyperplanes meet in a
  `(d−j)`-flat; AlgebraicIndependence.md row, see OD-4).

### ENTRY — Chain-entry ingredients: Lemma 4.6 dichotomy + Lemma 5.4 short-cycle base + Lemma 4.8 split-off

**Scope.** The three ingredients KT's general-`d` Case III invokes *to
enter* the chain argument, which `d=3` did not need on the load-bearing
path: (4.6) the chain-or-short-cycle dichotomy (a degree-2 minimal-0-dof
graph with no proper rigid subgraph is a short cycle or has a length-`d`
chain), (5.4) the short-cycle base (a cycle of length `3≤|V|≤D` realizes as
an infinitesimally rigid nonparallel panel-hinge framework — Crapo–Whiteley
[4]/[34]), and (4.8) the chain-interior split-off minimality (`Gᵢ = splitOff
at vᵢ` is minimal 0-dof). **Whether this is a standalone sub-phase or folds
into CHAIN is an open decision (OD-1/OD-2/OD-3)** — it hinges on whether 4.6/
4.8 already exist subsumed in the green Phase-20 `minimal_kdof_reduction`
machinery and whether 5.4 is genuinely on the Lean-load-bearing path or a
KT-narrative dependency (the `d=3` Case III dodged 5.4 entirely — §1.33(B.1)).

**Hard core.** Lemma 5.4 (the cycle realization) if it is genuinely
load-bearing: it is its own deferred sub-phase per risk #4 (the
panel-realization of a cycle with independent hinge extensors = the
Crapo–Whiteley projective fact), the one piece here that is real new panel
content rather than a Phase-20 graph fact. 4.6/4.8 are combinatorial and may
already be in tree.

**Dependency position.** Feeds CHAIN's chain entry (the dispatch needs to know
it is in the chain case, with a valid length-`d` chain and the base
framework on `G₁`). Could land *before* CHAIN if 5.4 is the bottleneck, or
*concurrently* if 4.6/4.8 are subsumed and 5.4 is narrative-only — see OD.

**Reuse/replace/add map:**
- *Check Phase-20 status:* Lemma 4.6 / Lemma 4.8 — no explicit blueprint
  node found at recon time; may be subsumed in `minimal_kdof_reduction`
  (`Molecular/Induction/`). The detailed recon must `lean_local_search`
  these before scoping. (OD-3.)
- *Add (if load-bearing):* Lemma 5.4 cycle base — its own leaf/sub-phase
  (risk #4; the project decided 2026-06-03 to *formalize, not cite* it as
  genuine panel content).

### ASSEMBLY — Assembly: Theorem 5.5 (general `d`) → Theorem 5.6 → Conjecture 1.2

**Scope.** With `CARRIER`–`ENTRY` green, compose: complete `theorem_55` at general `d`
(the Case-III arm now discharged by the CHAIN chain dispatch + ENTRY entry),
re-green `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` + its `hub` at general grade, derive
**Theorem 5.6** (KT §5.2: strip `G` to a minimal `k`-dof spanning subgraph,
realize via Thm 5.5, re-add the deleted edges — the rank only grows, using
projective invariance to arrange `Π(u)∩Π(v) ≠ ∅`), and **state Conjecture
1.2 as a theorem** (the panel-hinge ⇔ body-hinge realizability equivalence,
which combined with Phase 16's Prop 1.1 is the conjecture). The `d=3`
versions of the Thm 5.5→5.6 push (`rankHypothesis_of_theorem_55_d3`,
`theorem_55_6_d3`) are the templates — mostly carrier-lift + dropping the
`hn : bodyBarDim n = screwDim 2` specialization.

**Hard core.** Mostly composition once `CARRIER`–`ENTRY` land; the genuine content is
the general-`d` `hub` partition brick of `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` (a
Phase-19-partition obligation, **Track-independent**, already noted
multi-commit in the `d=3` case) and the projective-invariance step of
Thm 5.6 at general `d` (the `d=3` re-add was "projective-move-free" because
two distinct hyperplanes through the origin always meet — confirm that holds
at general `d`; KT §5.2 uses projective invariance [4, §3.6] explicitly).

**Dependency position.** Last; gates Cor 5.7 (Phase 26). Phases 24–25 (the
`d=3` bar-joint matroid, projective duality) can proceed in parallel — they
don't gate on the rank theorem until Cor 5.7.

**Reuse/replace/add map:**
- *Reuse / lift:* `rankHypothesis_of_theorem_55_d3` (`Theorem55.lean:2312`),
  `theorem_55_6_d3`, the strip `exists_isMinimalKDof_spanning_subgraph`, the
  re-aim `reaimSub`, the monotonicity `finrank_infinitesimalMotions_le_of_graph_le`.
- *Add:* the general-`d` `hub` partition; the Conjecture 1.2 statement node;
  the general-`d` projective-invariance arrangement (if not free).

---

## 3. Recommended sequence — and why 23a is first

**Sequence: 23a → {CHAIN, ENTRY interleaved} → ASSEMBLY.** ENTRY may lead CHAIN if
Lemma 5.4 turns out to be the long pole; CHAIN may split on contact.

**Why 23a (the carrier lift) is first, not CHAIN (the chain argument):**
1. *Everything downstream is stated over the carrier.* The chain dispatch
   (CHAIN) concludes `HasGenericFullRankRealization k n G` and consumes
   `screwDim k` rank bounds; the `⋀^{d−1}` duality is stated over
   `Fin (k+2) → ℝ`. Both must be *written* at general grade, which is only
   coherent once the spine they plug into is general grade. Building CHAIN
   first would force every new lemma to carry a private `screwDim 2`→`k`
   bridge, exactly the friction the carrier lift removes once.
2. *It is the largest mechanical surface and the one most likely to surface
   a blocking transport.* ScrewSpaceCarrier §6 explicitly flags the
   symbolic-`k` `screwBasis`/`annihRow` transport as unconfirmed at general
   grade (the d=3 probe found it defeq-free only at `k=2`). Doing 23a first
   surfaces any such blocker before the hard *new* mathematics of CHAIN is
   built on top — the project's design-pass-first discipline (don't grind
   research-shaped work over an unverified foundation).
3. *It is the natural home for the deferred carrier "part 2."* 22l deferred
   the general-`d` API migration to this boundary precisely so it lands
   against the now-known general-`d` usage; 23a is that landing.

**FIRST sub-phase = 23a.** The next dispatch is the **23a detailed,
leaf-level recon** (read the spine files end-to-end, enumerate the
`screwDim 2`/`Fin 4`/`ScrewSpace 2` reach-ins along the import spine, run
the ScrewSpaceCarrier §6 opacity-probe-style per-layer readiness check at
symbolic `k`, and cut 23a into buildable leaves). Not a build.

---

## 4. Open decisions (clause-(ii) flags — honest unknowns this recon could
not settle from the source)

- **OD-1. Is Lemma 5.4 (short-cycle base) genuinely on the Lean-load-bearing
  path at general `d`?** KT p. 692 invokes it explicitly: *"If `G` is a
  cycle of length at most `d`, then we are done by Lemma 5.4."* So at
  general `d` the short-cycle base is a **real branch of the Case-III case
  split** — unlike `d=3`, where Case III's `|V|=3` floor was the triangle
  handled inline (the `d=3` assembly dodged 5.4, §1.33(B.1)). *Unsettled:*
  whether the general-`d` formalization can likewise dodge it (e.g. if the
  chain dichotomy can be arranged so the cycle branch is vacuous or folded
  into the base case) or must formalize 5.4 as KT does. If load-bearing,
  5.4 is its own leaf/sub-phase (risk #4: genuine panel content, the
  Crapo–Whiteley cycle realization). **Present as an open branch; do not
  pre-commit a cut that assumes 5.4 is free.**

- **OD-2. Does the general-`d` chain entry (Lemma 4.6 dichotomy) reduce to
  Phase-20 machinery, or is it a new combinatorial prerequisite?** KT's
  4.6 says a 2-edge-connected minimal-0-dof graph with no proper rigid
  subgraph either is a short cycle or has a length-`d` chain. The `d=3`
  assembly entered Case III with a degree-2 vertex `v` and its two
  neighbours `a,b` (the `splitOff v a b` shape) — it never needed the full
  4.6 dichotomy because the 3-candidate dispatch only needed *one* degree-2
  vertex plus its `a`-neighbour's `c`. The general chain needs the *whole*
  length-`d` chain `v₀…v_d`. *Unsettled:* whether `minimal_kdof_reduction`
  (Phase 20) already produces a chain of the needed length, or only the
  single degree-2 split. **The detailed recon must check this in tree
  before scoping ENTRY.**

- **OD-3. Do Lemmas 4.6 / 4.8 already exist (subsumed) in the green
  Phase-20 `minimal_kdof_reduction`, or are they new nodes?** §1.33(C)
  flagged "no explicit node found; may be subsumed." The recon could not
  confirm from prose alone. If subsumed, ENTRY shrinks to "Lemma 5.4 (modulo
  OD-1)"; if not, 4.6/4.8 are new combinatorial leaves. **`lean_local_search`
  for the chain dichotomy / split-off-minimality lemmas is the first
  detailed-recon task for ENTRY.**

- **OD-4. Does the general-`d` N3a (the `d+1` points in general position,
  eq. 6.67) take the existence/Zariski route like the `d=3` N3a, or does it
  force the algebraic-independence hammer?** KT p. 698 states it via alg-
  independence: *"the set of the coefficients … is algebraically independent
  over the rational field. Therefore, for any `j` hyperplanes among them,
  their intersection forms a `(d−j)`-dimensional affine space."* The `d=3`
  N3a was **AVOIDED** (existence route — exhibit one explicit seed where the
  4 points are affinely independent; AlgebraicIndependence.md row #106),
  because at `d=3` the construction is explicit (triple-intersection +
  cross-products). *Unsettled at general `d`:* whether an explicit `d+1`-
  point construction exists (giving the existence route again) or the
  symbolic `j`-hyperplanes-meet-in-`(d−j)`-flat genericity genuinely needs
  alg-independence. The seed-rank kernel (`case_III_nested_rank_lower`)
  **already** consumes `AlgebraicIndependent ℚ q` at `d=3`, so the
  alg-independence machinery is live regardless — but the *N3a points* step
  may or may not be a *new* alg-independence site. **A general-`d` row is
  added to `AlgebraicIndependence.md` either way (the standing instruction);
  the relaxation question (§2 risk (c): does the touched-subgraph family
  grow with `d`?) is exactly this OD.**

- **OD-5. Does the general-`d` carrier lift force a motive/carrier change?**
  ScrewSpaceCarrier §6's whole concern was that freezing the opaque API
  against `d=3`-only usage risks a Phase-23 reshape. *Unsettled:* whether
  the symbolic-`k` `screwBasis`/`annihRow` transport (hard-part (d), proven
  defeq-free only at `k=2`) ports verbatim or needs an API addition. **The
  23a detailed recon's opacity-readiness probe at symbolic `k` settles
  this** — and it is the load-bearing reason 23a is first.

- **OD-6. Does CHAIN split (chain bookkeeping vs duality) on contact?** The
  two hard cores (eqs. 6.59–6.64 chain bookkeeping; the `⋀^{d−1}` duality
  finish, eq. 6.67) are largely independent. Whether they are two leaves of
  one sub-phase or warrant a split is a contact decision for the CHAIN open,
  not settleable now.

## 23a — detailed leaf-level recon

**Status:** detailed-recon done (docs only, 2026-06-17, source-verified +
LSP-probed against the landed tree). Decomposes 23a (§2) into buildable
leaves with exact target signatures, settles **OD-5**, and resolves the
cheap **OD-2/OD-3** in passing. The general-recon §1–§5 above is the parent;
this section is the leaf plan `notes/Phase23a.md` hands off to.

### (a) Per-file reach-in enumeration along the import spine

Spine order (`ScrewSpaceCarrier-design.md` §5): RigidityMatrix/{Basic,
Bricks,Claim612} → PanelLayer → Pinning → PanelHinge → GenericityDevice →
Coupling → CaseI → CaseII → CaseIII/{Arms,Candidate,Relabel,Realization} →
Theorem55. The **central source-verified correction to §1**: the carrier
*infrastructure* and most *bricks* are already general-`k`; the `screwDim 2`/
`Fin 4`/`…2` pins are **numeral specializations at call sites**, not
definitional pins. The lift is therefore mechanical numeral-replacement
(`2`→`k`, `Fin 4`→`Fin (k+2)`, `screwDim 2`→`screwDim k`, `…Realization 2`→
`… k`) **plus** a small symbolic-arithmetic kit and a `Fin 4` panel-geometry
lift — *not* a structure redefinition.

Per-file, dependency-ordered (this ordering IS the leaf sequence):

| File | Pin reach-ins | Lift status for 23a |
|---|---|---|
| **RigidityMatrix/Basic** | `screwDim`=`(k+2).choose 2` (general); `ScrewSpace`/`mk`/`val`/`equivExteriorPower`/3 instances all `(k:ℕ)`; `screwSpace_finrank` uses `change`+`exteriorPower.finrank_eq` (general, no `decide`). 1×`screwDim 2`/`ScrewSpace 2` in a doc-comment only. | **already general.** Add only the `screwDim k` arithmetic kit (below). |
| **RigidityMatrix/Bricks** | none | none |
| **RigidityMatrix/Claim612** | 68×`Fin 4`, 15×`ScrewSpace 2`. **Two families:** (i) general-`k` `{k:ℕ}` algebra (`eq_zero_of_annihilates_span_top`, `mem_hingeRowBlock_iff`, `linearIndependent_sum*_candidateRow*`, `candidateRow_ne_zero`, …) — done; (ii) **`Fin 4` panel-geometry/duality** (`span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top`, `omitTwoExtensor_*`, `exists_independent_perp_pair`, `exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals`, `exists_*complementIso*`, `exists_hduality_witness*`). | family (ii) splits: the **incidence/extensor** lemmas feeding the spine lift in 23a; the **`⋀²ℝ⁴` duality** lemmas (`exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals`, `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence`, `exists_hduality_witness*`) are **consumed only inside `case_III_candidate_dispatch`** → CHAIN. |
| **PanelLayer** | 46×`Fin 4` vs **174×`Fin (k+2)`** — mostly general. `Fin 4` cluster is the `d=3` **panel-incidence geometry** (≈ll.357–838): `exists_two_perp_of_linearIndependent_normals`, `exists_three_perp`, `exists_linearIndependent_extensor_pair_perp`, `exists_extensor_eq_panelSupportExtensor`, `exists_extensor_in_two_panels`. The `fin_cases`/`decide` (33) are all in this band. | **`screwBasis`/`annihRow`/`annihRowPoly`/`panelSupportExtensor`/`panelSupportPoly`/`triLI_subpairs`/`exists_triangle_normals` are ALL already `(k:ℕ)`** (ll.232,960,1091,1164,1252,1271,1408). Lift only the `Fin 4` incidence band (the dimension count `finrank ℝ (Fin 4→ℝ)=4` → `=k+2`). |
| **Pinning** | 0 `Fin 4`/`screwDim 2`; 1 `fin_cases` (general). | none (general). |
| **PanelHinge** | 0. `PanelHingeFramework (k:ℕ)`, `HasGenericFullRankRealization (k n:ℕ)`, `HasPanelRealization (k n:ℕ)`, `ofNormals (q:α×Fin (k+2)→ℝ)`, `IsGeneralPosition` all parametric. | none (general — and opacity-neutral, L3 probe). |
| **GenericityDevice** | 0 `Fin 4`/`screwDim 2`; the 4×`…Realization 2` are in the forgetful map `hasPanelRealization_of_generic`. The 5× `change … (Pi.single a (screwBasis k t))` blocks (hard-part (d)) are **already `screwBasis k`**; `exists_good_realization_ofParam` is the device proof, stated `screwDim k * card α`. | none for the device; the forgetful-map `2`-pins lift with the `HasGenericFullRankRealization` numeral pass. |
| **Coupling** | **0 `screwDim 2`/`Fin 4`/`…2`** — fully general (`extProj`, `degeneratePlacement (nrm:α→Fin (k+2)→ℝ)`, all coupling producers `ScrewSpace k`). | **none.** |
| **CaseI** | **0 `screwDim 2`/`Fin 4`/`…2`** — fully general (`case_I_realization {n k:ℕ}` is dof-`k`; dimension general). | **none.** |
| **CaseII** | 26×`screwDim 2`, 8×`ScrewSpace 2`, 4×`…Realization 2`. All in `case_II_realization_all_k`'s **rank arithmetic** (`screwDim 2 * (|V|-1) - (k-1)`, the eq.-(6.12) ℤ/ℕ-cast plumbing) + the conclusion numeral. No `decide`/`fin_cases`. | lift: numeral pass + the `screwDim k` arithmetic kit (the cast plumbing is `toNat_le_of_add_pred_eq`-style, already `{D V N:ℕ}`-parametric in Basic). |
| **CaseIII/{Arms,Candidate,Relabel}** | Arms: 8×`…Realization 2` (incl. `case_III_hsplit_producer`, which calls `hasGenericFullRankRealization_of_triangle (k:=2)` — the triangle brick is **already `(k)`-parametric**) + 8 `fin_cases`/`decide` in the M2/M3-arm geometry. Candidate: 0 literal pins, but the Claim-6.11 family is `ScrewSpace k`/`Fin (k+2)` (general); `caseIIICandidate`/`case_III_old_new_blocks`/`case_III_rank_certification` consume the `q : α × Fin 4` dispatch shape. Relabel: 0 pins (general `ofNormals_relabel` machinery). | numeral pass on Arms' `…Realization 2`; the M2/M3 geometry + `caseIIICandidate` chain bookkeeping is **CHAIN** (it is the dispatch internals). 23a stops at the producer *skeleton* `case_III_hsplit_producer` shape, leaving `hcand` explicit. |
| **CaseIII/Realization** | 13×`Fin 4`, 12×`screwDim 2`, 11×`…Realization 2`, 7×`fin_cases`/`decide`. **`case_III_candidate_dispatch` (181–517)** is the structurally-fixed-3-candidate body (`q:α×Fin 4`, fixed `v,a,b,c`, the `linearIndependent_normals_of_algebraicIndependent` (l.99, `Fin 4`-pinned) + `exists_homogeneousIncidence`+`exists_complementIso` `⋀²ℝ⁴` discriminator at ll.351–353) → **CHAIN replace.** `case_III_nested_rank_lower` (561), `case_III_realization_0dof` (518), `case_III_realization` (665) are `screwDim 2`/`q:α×Fin 4`-pinned **spine** decls. | lift `_nested_rank_lower`/`_realization`/`_0dof` (numeral + arithmetic kit); their proofs compose general bricks **except** the `case_III_candidate_dispatch` call → that call becomes the green-modulo `hcand` hypothesis (boundary (d) below). |
| **Theorem55** | 27×`Fin 4`, 73×`screwDim 2`, 40×`…Realization 2`, 21×`…Framework 2`, 6 `decide`. `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k` (2176) is the dof-`k` induction spine, **dimension-pinned at `screwDim 2`** via `hn`; its callback map wires base/cut/CaseI/CaseII/CaseIII bricks at `(k:=2)`. The `theorem_55_d3`/`_all_k` wrappers discharge `hD`/`hn` by `decide`. The cut/coupling helpers carry the assembly `q:α×Fin 4` / `Pi.single 0 1 : Fin 4→ℝ` / `Set.powersetCard (Fin 4) 2`. | the **largest numeral surface**; lift `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k` to `HasGenericFullRankRealization k`, restate `hn:bodyBarDim n = screwDim k` + an `hD` floor giving `screwDim k ≥ 2` (see kit), thread the green-modulo `hcand` up. `rankHypothesis_of_theorem_55_d3` / Thm-5.6 push is **ASSEMBLY** (not 23a). |

`linearIndependent_normals_of_algebraicIndependent` (Realization l.99,
`Fin 4`-pinned) is consumed **both** inside the dispatch (CHAIN) **and** by
`Theorem55.lean:565/678` (cut/base spine) and `Pinning` — so it is a **shared
brick 23a must lift** to `Fin (k+2)` (it is the "any `k`+1 distinct-body
normals are LI from alg-indep" fact; generalizes by the same Vandermonde/
projection argument, no `d=3` content).

### (b) OD-5 verdict — **PORTS VERBATIM. No carrier-API addition; no spike.**

The coordinate transport (hard-part (d): `screwBasis`/`annihRow`) **is already
written at symbolic `k` in the landed tree and already compiles.** Three
source facts, each verified, settle it:

1. **`screwBasis (k:ℕ)`** (PanelLayer:1252)
   `= (Pi.basisFun ℝ (Fin (k+2))).exteriorPower k |>.map (equivExteriorPower k).symm`;
   **`screwBasis_repr_apply := rfl`** at general `k` (1261); the whole
   `annihRow`/`_apply`/`_self`/`_add`/`_smul`/`span_annihRow_eq_dualAnnihilator`/
   `annihRowPoly`/`_eval` family (1271–1419+) is `(k:ℕ)`, proved through
   **abstract `Module.Basis` API** (`repr_self_apply`, `coord_apply`,
   `Basis.ext`, `sum_repr`) — zero `k=2`-concreteness, zero `decide`/`fin_cases`.
2. **`GenericityDevice.exists_good_realization_ofParam`** — the device proof
   exercising the dual-basis coordinate machinery — is stated
   `screwDim k * Fintype.card α` over `Set.powersetCard (Fin (k+2)) k` /
   `Pi.basis (fun _ => screwBasis k)`, with the 5× hard-part-(d)
   `change … (Pi.single a (screwBasis k t)) = …` blocks **already symbolic**
   and green in HEAD.
3. **Carrier API + instances** are `(k:ℕ)` with `inferInstanceAs`
   (ScrewSpaceCarrier §5 OQ4 confirmed instances resolve symbolically);
   `equivExteriorPower` is the `cast (ScrewSpace_def k)` form, `k`-parametric.

So ScrewSpaceCarrier §6's worry — "hard-part (d) gets exercised symbolically
*for the first time* in Phase 23" — is **already false in the landed source**:
the coordinate layer was authored general from the start and the `d=3` usage
only ever specialized the *numerals around it*, never the transport. **OD-5
resolves to "ports verbatim"; 23a needs no carrier-API addition and no
build-spike.** *Residual flag:* the LSP can't prove a clean cap stays at
default under the full general-`k` numeral substitution end-to-end (the same
class of unconfirmable as ScrewSpaceCarrier OQ1) — but that is a perf
observation, not a correctness blocker, and every cap is already at default
(0 overrides). If a lifted file regresses a cap, raise it locally (the
standing idiom), do not treat it as an OD-5 reopening.

**The genuinely-new symbolic surface 23a DOES introduce** is *not* the
coordinate machinery but the **`screwDim k` numeric arithmetic**: at `k=2`
the spine discharges `2 ≤ screwDim 2`, `screwDim 2 - 2 ≤ screwDim 2·(m-1)`,
`screwDim 2 = 6` by `decide`; at symbolic `k` these become `screwDim k`
obligations. **LSP-probed (2026-06-17):** `omega` does **not** close
`2 ≤ screwDim k` after `unfold screwDim` (the `choose 2 = n(n-1)/2` integer
division defeats it), and **`2 ≤ screwDim k` is FALSE at `k=0`**
(`screwDim 0 = (2).choose 2 = 1`); it holds only from the dimension floor
`k ≥ 1` (`screwDim 1 = 3`). `1 ≤ screwDim k` *does* close
(`Nat.one_le_iff_ne_zero.mpr (by simp [screwDim, Nat.choose_eq_zero_iff])`).
⟹ **23a's Leaf 0 is a tiny `screwDim`-arithmetic kit** (below), and the
spine's `hn`/`hD` hypotheses must thread a `k ≥ 1` floor (the body-bar regime
`d = k+1 ≥ 2`) so the `≥ 2` facts are derivable, not `decide`d.

### (c) Buildable-leaf sequence for 23a

Smallest-buildable commits, dependency-ordered. Each re-greens its file(s)
on the still-green tree (the lift is additive/restating, not deleting).

- **Leaf 0 — `screwDim` arithmetic kit** (`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`). **DONE
  (c2669b3).** Added `one_le_screwDim {k} : 1 ≤ screwDim k`,
  `two_le_screwDim {k} (hk : 1 ≤ k) : 2 ≤ screwDim k` (the floor-conditioned
  `≥2`), and `screwDim_sub_two_le_mul {k m} (hm : 2 ≤ m) : screwDim k - 2 ≤ screwDim k * (m-1)`
  (the `_nested_rank_lower` l.641/643 `decide` replacements). Tiny `Nat.choose`
  lemmas; no carrier content. Touches Basic only; no consumers yet, so
  trivially green. **Two corrections to this recon spec at build:**
  `screwDim_sub_two_le_mul` takes **`2 ≤ m`**, not the `1 ≤ m` originally
  written — the latter is *provably false* at `m = 1` (RHS `= D·0 = 0 < D−2`
  for `k ≥ 1`); the call site (`case_III_nested_rank_lower`) has `2 ≤ |V'|` in
  scope. And its `(hk)` is unused (`D−2 ≤ D = D·1 ≤ D·(m−1)` needs nothing
  about `k`), so dropped.
- **Leaf 1 — `Fin 4` panel-incidence geometry → `Fin (k+2)`** (`PanelLayer.lean`,
  ll.357–838 band). **Split at build into two commits** (see corrections below):
  - **Leaf 1a (DONE)** — the duality-free rank-nullity core. Landed the general
    brick `exists_linearIndependent_perp_of_normals {r m} (N : Fin r → Fin (k+2)
    → ℝ) (hmr : m + r ≤ k + 2)` (`m` LI vectors in `⋂ⱼ Nⱼ^⊥`, `mulVecLin` kernel
    + `finrank_range_add_finrank_ker`, `Module.finrank_pi`+`Fintype.card_fin` at
    `k+2`); `exists_two_perp_of_linearIndependent_normals` (`r=2,m=2`),
    `exists_three_perp` (`r=1,m=3`), and `exists_extensor_in_two_panels`
    (`r=2,m=2`) now reduce to it (triplicated rank-nullity proof deleted).
  - **Leaf 1b (next)** — the grade-`k` extensor remainder: lift
    `exists_linearIndependent_extensor_pair_perp` and
    `exists_extensor_in_two_panels` to produce `ScrewSpace k` extensors of
    `Fin k`/`Fin (k+1)`-tuples (the `Fin k`-arity geometry, off
    `exists_linearIndependent_perp_of_normals`), with `k=2` wrappers keeping
    `theorem_55_base`/cut-edge green. Detail: `notes/Phase23a.md` *Hand-off*.
  - **DROPPED to CHAIN:** `exists_extensor_eq_panelSupportExtensor` (+ its
    corollary `extensorInPanel_panelSupportExtensor`, helper
    `panelSupportExtensor_join_eq_zero_of_eq_zero`) — routes through `Meet.lean`'s
    `extensor_join_eq_zero_of_complementIso_eq_zero_dotProduct` →
    `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join`, the `⋀²ℝ⁴` point-join↔panel-meet
    duality this recon assigns to CHAIN. Lifts only *with* the `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})`
    duality finish.
  - **23a-OD-A — RESOLVED, recommendation was WRONG.** `ExtensorInPanel C n`
    (`Basic.lean:276`) needs `C.val = extensor p` with `p : Fin k → Fin (k+2) →
    ℝ`; the perp arity is the **extensor grade `k`**, not the codim-2 hinge. So
    the extensor-bearing bricks need `Fin k`/`Fin (k+1)` tuples at general `k`
    (Leaf 1b), *not* the ambient-only `Fin 2` the recommendation claimed.
- **Leaf 2 — `Fin 4` incidence/extensor bricks in Claim612 + the shared LI
  brick** (`RigidityMatrix/Claim612.lean`, `CaseIII/Realization.lean` l.99).
  Lift `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top`, `omitTwoExtensor_eq_extensor_kept`,
  `omitTwoExtensor_homogenize_eq_extensor_kept`, `exists_independent_perp_pair`
  (the incidence bricks the spine — not the dispatch duality — consumes) and
  `linearIndependent_normals_of_algebraicIndependent` (Realization l.99) to
  `Fin (k+2)`. **Leave the `⋀²ℝ⁴`-duality lemmas
  (`exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals`,
  `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence`,
  `exists_hduality_witness_of_panel_incidence`) at `Fin 4` — they are
  dispatch-only (CHAIN).** Re-green Claim612 (the general-`k` family is
  untouched). **23a-OD-B:** `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` is stated
  `{pbar : Fin 4 → Fin 4 → ℝ}` (a *square* `(k+2)×(k+2)` system) — confirm its
  proof generalizes (it should: it is `omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent_of_li {e:ℕ}`
  applied + a `span = top` dimension count, both already general).
- **Leaf 3 — CaseII rank-arithmetic numeral pass** (`CaseII.lean`). Restate
  `case_II_realization_all_k` and its lemmas at `screwDim k` /
  `HasGenericFullRankRealization k`, routing the eq.-(6.12) ℤ/ℕ cast plumbing
  through the (already `{D V N:ℕ}`-parametric) Basic helpers and the Leaf-0
  kit for the `≥2` facts. Re-green CaseII.
- **Leaf 4 — Case-III spine lift with the dispatch left explicit**
  (`CaseIII/Realization.lean` + `CaseIII/Arms.lean`). Restate
  `case_III_nested_rank_lower`, `case_III_realization_0dof`,
  `case_III_realization` at `screwDim k`/`Fin (k+2)`/`… k`; their proofs
  compose general bricks + the Leaf-0 kit, **except** the
  `case_III_candidate_dispatch` call. **Re-state `case_III_realization` (and
  `case_III_hsplit_producer`'s `hcand` slot) to take the chain dispatch as an
  explicit hypothesis** `hcand`/`hdispatch` of the general-`k` shape (boundary
  (d)). Re-green CaseIII.
- **Leaf 5 — Theorem55 spine lift, dispatch threaded up** (`Theorem55.lean`).
  Restate `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k` to `HasGenericFullRankRealization k`
  with `hn : bodyBarDim n = screwDim k` + the `k≥1`/`hD`-floor, lift its
  base/cut/CaseI/CaseII/CaseIII callback wiring numeral-wise, and **thread the
  green-modulo `hcand` hypothesis** through to `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k`'s
  own signature (its callers CHAIN discharges). Keep a `theorem_55_d3` wrapper
  that specializes `k:=2` and discharges the dispatch via the *existing*
  `case_III_candidate_dispatch` (so the `d=3` line stays fully green through
  23a — no regression). Re-green Theorem55. **This leaf closes 23a.**

Carrier-API additions preceding consumers: **none** (OD-5 verbatim). The only
"add" is Leaf-0's three `screwDim` arithmetic lemmas — not carrier API, pure
`Nat.choose`.

### (d) Green-modulo boundary 23a leaves for CHAIN

`case_III_realization` (and through it `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k`) **cannot be
closed at general `k` until CHAIN supplies the chain dispatch**, because the body
calls `case_III_candidate_dispatch` (the fixed-3-candidate `d=3` argument).
23a's boundary: lift `case_III_realization` / `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k` to
carry the dispatch as an **explicit `hcand`/`hdispatch` hypothesis** of the
general-`k` `case_III_hsplit_producer.hcand` shape — i.e. *"given the chain
data + a fresh `e₀` + the IH-generic `v`-split realization at dimension `k`,
produce `HasGenericFullRankRealization k n G`."* (The standing explicit-`h…`
crux idiom; never a `sorry`.) The **`d=3` line stays fully green** because the
`theorem_55_d3` wrapper specializes `k:=2` and fills `hcand` from the existing
`case_III_candidate_dispatch`. CHAIN replaces the fixed-3-candidate dispatch with
the length-`d` chain dispatch + `⋀^{d-1}(ℝ^{d+1})` duality, discharging the
hypothesis at general `k`.

**Boundary as actually built (23a Leaf 5 — wider than this (d) anticipated).**
The dispatch is only one of **six** green-modulo carries `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k_all_k`
takes; the others (base/cut/Case-I/M4-forget producers `d=3`-pinned → CHAIN's
duality; the `6 ≤ bodyBarDim n` chain-extraction floor → ENTRY) are recorded in
the **Scope expansion** note under §"CHAIN" above and in `notes/Phase23a.md`
*Hand-off*. (a)'s per-file claims that base/cut/Case-I and the forgetful map
"lift with the numeral pass" are **superseded** by that finding.

### (e) 23a-specific open decisions

- **23a-OD-A (Leaf 1 point-arity) — RESOLVED at the Leaf-1a build: the
  point-arity IS `d`-dependent; the "ambient-only" recommendation was wrong.**
  `ExtensorInPanel C n` (`Basic.lean:276`) requires `C.val = extensor p` with
  `p : Fin k → Fin (k+2) → ℝ` — the perp tuple's length is the **extensor grade
  `k`**, not the codim-2 hinge. So the extensor-bearing bricks
  (`exists_linearIndependent_extensor_pair_perp`, `exists_extensor_in_two_panels`)
  need `Fin k`/`Fin (k+1)` perp tuples at general `k` (Leaf 1b). The *ambient*
  `Fin 4 → Fin (k+2)` lift and the rank-nullity count are arity-clean (the
  general brick `exists_linearIndependent_perp_of_normals` carries them); only
  the extensor construction is `k`-arity.
- **23a-OD-B (`span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` squareness).** Its `Fin 4×Fin 4`
  system generalizes to `(k+2)×(k+2)` via the already-general
  `omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent_of_li {e:ℕ}` + a `span=top` count.
  Confirm the dimension count ports; expected clean.
- **23a-OD-C (cap regressions under symbolic `k`).** OD-5 is verbatim for
  *correctness*; the LSP cannot confirm the 0-override perf state survives the
  full numeral substitution. *Recommendation:* treat any regressed cap as a
  local `maxHeartbeats` bump at that decl (standing idiom), not an OD-5
  reopening. Not a blocker.

### OD-2 / OD-3 resolution (secondary; for ENTRY scoping)

In tree under `Molecular/Induction/`:
- **KT Lemma 4.6** (chain-or-cycle / degree-2 vertex): `exists_low_degree_vertex`
  + `exists_adjacent_degree_two_pair` (`ReducibleVertex.lean:620/814`, cited
  "KT Lemma 4.6 at `d=3`") and `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`
  (`ForestSurgery/Reduction.lean:383`).
- **KT Lemma 4.8** (split-off minimality): `splitOff_removeVertex_minimalKDof`
  (`Reduction.lean:1492`) + `lem:reduction-step-pos` (1736), cited "KT Lemma
  4.8(i)/(ii)".

**Verdict (OD-3):** 4.6/4.8 **exist, but only in their fixed-tuple `d=3`
form** — `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` produces a **fixed `v,a,b,c` 4-tuple**
(`exists_adjacent_degree_two_pair` + two `exists_splitOff_data_of_degree_eq_two`),
**not** a length-`d` chain `v₀…v_d`. So the general-`d` chain producer is a
**new combinatorial leaf for ENTRY**, *not* subsumed; OD-2's "does Phase-20
produce a length-`d` chain?" answer is **no — only the single degree-2 split**.
**Verdict (OD-1, corroborating):** no dedicated Lemma 5.4 short-cycle decl
exists; the `d=3` Case III handles its `|V|=3` floor via the triangle base
`hasGenericFullRankRealization_of_triangle` (Arms.lean), confirming the `d=3`
assembly **dodged 5.4** — whether the general-`d` formalization can likewise
dodge it stays open for ENTRY.

## CHAIN — detailed leaf-level recon

**Status:** detailed-recon done (docs only, 2026-06-17, source-verified +
KT §6.4.2 read end-to-end against the landed tree; the minted letter is
**23b**, work log `notes/Phase23b.md`). Decomposes the CHAIN layer (§2) into
buildable leaves with exact target signatures, decides **OD-6**, settles/flags
**OD-4**, and scopes the lift of the four 23a-carried producers + the
`hdispatch` carry. The general-recon §1–§5 and the §"CHAIN" scope note are the
parent; this section is the leaf plan `notes/Phase23b.md` hands off to.

**KT §6.4.2 read (verified 2026-06-17, PDF pp. 692–698 = pdf pages 45–51,
offset −647).** The general-`d` argument, eqs. (6.46)–(6.67): a chain
`v₀v₁…v_d` with `d_G(vᵢ)=2` for `1≤i≤d−1`; one base framework `(G₁,q₁)` on the
split-off `G₁ = G^{v₀v₂}_{v₁}` with `R(G₁,q₁)=D(|V|−2)` (6.46); `d` candidate
frameworks `(G,p₀),…,(G,p_{d−1})` (6.47/6.48/6.57/6.59) built from `(G₁,q₁)`
and the isos `ρᵢ` (6.54)/(6.56); each `R(G,pᵢ)` reduced by column+row ops to a
top-left `D×D` block `Mᵢ` plus `R(G₁∖(v₀v₂)_{i*}, q₁)` (6.50/6.53/6.64), using
the **always-existing redundant `(v₀v₂)_{i*}` row from Claim 6.11** (6.51/6.52);
the ±r chain `∑ⱼλ rⱼ(q(vᵢvᵢ₊₁)) = ±r` for `2≤i≤d−1` (6.66, "in a manner
similar to (6.44)", the degree-2 fact); whence `Mᵢ` fails full rank iff
`r ⊥ C(Lᵢ)`. The eq. (6.67) finish: take `d+1` points `p₀…p_d` with `pᵢ ∈
⋂_{j≠i}Πⱼ ∖ Πᵢ` and `p_d = ⋂ⱼΠⱼ`; they are affinely independent, every
`(d−1)`-subset's `(d−2)`-flat lies in `⋃ⱼΠⱼ`, so the `(d−1)`-extensors of
`(d−1)`-subsets span a `(d+1 choose d−1) = D`-dim space by **Lemma 2.1**,
forcing some `Mᵢ` to have full rank, i.e. `rank R(G,pᵢ) = D + D(|V|−2) =
D(|V|−1)`. KT, p. 692: *"The proof strategy is exactly the same as `d = 3`."*

### (a) Per-file reach-in enumeration along the CHAIN surface

The carrier + arm-realization layer **is already general-`k`** (23a lifted the
spine; the M₁/M₂/M₃ arm closers were authored `(k:ℕ)` from Phase 22h). The
`Fin 4`/`⋀²ℝ⁴`/`screwDim 2`/`Fin 3`-pins that remain are concentrated in **the
dispatch and its `⋀²ℝ⁴` discriminator** — exactly the surface §1/§"CHAIN"
isolate as the new argument. Source-verified per-decl:

| Decl | File:line | Grade as landed | CHAIN action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `case_III_candidate_dispatch` | `CaseIII/Realization.lean:201` | `q : α × Fin 4 → ℝ`, fixed `v,a,b,c`, `na/nb/nc`, `ScrewSpace 2`, `screwDim 2`, `Fin 3` dispatch (`fin_cases u`), `h622lb` over `Fin 4` — **`d=3`-pinned AND structurally fixed-3-candidate** | **REPLACE** by the `d`-chain dispatch (eqs. 6.46–6.67) |
| `exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals` | `Claim612.lean:393` | `n : Fin 3 → Fin 4 → ℝ`, returns `pbar : Fin 4 → Fin 4 → ℝ` with the **`d+1`(=4)-point incidence pattern** (`pbar 0 ⊥ all`, `pbar i+1 ⊥ all but n i`) | re-state at `Fin d → Fin (d+1) → ℝ` → `pbar : Fin (d+1) → Fin (d+1) → ℝ` (the eq. 6.67 `d+1` points) |
| `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence` | `Claim612.lean:1179` | `r : Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace 2)`, `n : Fin 3`, returns `u : Fin 3` + `n'` with `r(complementIso(k:=2)(j:=2) ⟨extensor ![n u, n'], …⟩) ≠ 0` | re-state at `ScrewSpace (d−1)`, `Fin d`, `complementIso(k:=d−1)(j:=d−1)`, `(d−1)`-extensor `extensor (Fin.cons (n u) n' …)` |
| `exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence` | `Claim612.lean:522` | `Fin 4` joins, `omitTwoExtensor pbar`, `exists_independent_perp_pair`, `omitTwoExtensor_eq_extensor_kept` | re-state at `Fin (d+1)`; routes through the duality leaves below |
| `case_III_claim612` | `Claim612.lean` | `Fin 4`/`ScrewSpace 2`, the six-join existential via `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` (general `k`, landed Leaf 2) + the join↔meet duality | re-state at `ScrewSpace (d−1)`/`Fin (d+1)`; **N1 brick `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` already general** |
| `omitTwoExtensor_eq_extensor_kept`, `…_homogenize_…`, `exists_independent_perp_pair` | `Claim612.lean:482/283/319` | `Fin 4`-pinned incidence/extensor bricks (dispatch-internal, 23a moved to CHAIN) | re-state at `Fin (d+1)` (mechanical; the `Fin 4`-arity geometry → `Fin (d+1)`) |
| `extensor_mem_range_map_subtype_of_mem`, `exists_smul_eq_of_mem_range_map_subtype` | `Meet.lean:648/676` | `W : Submodule ℝ (Fin 4 → ℝ)`, `⋀[ℝ]^2`, `finrank_exteriorPower_two_eq_one`, `finrank(range)=2.choose 2=1` | **re-state at** `⋀[ℝ]^{d−1}(Fin (d+1)→ℝ)` with `finrank(⋀^{d−1}W)=(dim W choose d−1)` (W of `dim = d−1` ⟹ `=1`); the route is general mathlib, the lemmas re-state at concrete grade |
| `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` | `Meet.lean:1075` | `n_u n' pi pj : Fin 4 → ℝ`, `complementIso(k:=2)(j:=2)`, `Φ̃ = wedgeFixedLeft n_u ⊔ wedgeFixedLeft n'` `dim 5`, `Ω = dualAnnihilator Φ̃` `dim 1`, `extensor ![…]` (2-extensors) | re-state at `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})`: `pi…` = `d−1` points, `n_u n'` → the `d−1` panel normals of `Π(u)`; the `dim Ω = 1` count generalizes (`finrank ⋀^{d−1} = D`, `Φ̃` codim 1) |
| `exteriorPower_basis_toDual_eq_pairingDual_comp_map` | `Meet.lean:866` | `(Pi.basisFun ℝ (Fin 4)).exteriorPower n` — `Fin 4`-pinned base | re-state at `Fin (d+1)` (the proof is `Module.Basis.ext` + `pairingDual_ιMulti_ιMulti`, dimension-generic) |
| `exists_extensor_eq_panelSupportExtensor` | `PanelLayer.lean` (23a Leaf-1b DROP) | the `⋀²ℝ⁴` point-join↔panel-meet bridge consumer; **the M4-forget unblocker** | lift **with** the duality finish (the four-producer lift, §"CHAIN"(d)) |
| `case_III_arm_realization`, `_M2`, `_M3` | `Arms.lean:72`, `Relabel.lean` | **ALREADY general `k`** (`q : α × Fin (k+2)`, `ScrewSpace k`, `screwDim k`) — the per-candidate certify-then-rebase + relabel transport | **reuse verbatim** as the per-candidate engine the `d`-chain dispatch feeds |
| `linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow` | `RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean:1231` | **general `k`, graph-free**; augments by **one** `Unit` candidate | **generalize** to a `d`-fold `Sum`/`Fin d`-indexed augment (CHAIN-1) |

**The central structural finding (verified, reshapes the cut): the
arm-realization engine is general-grade; only the DISPATCH (candidate count +
`⋀²ℝ⁴` discriminator) is `d=3`-fixed.** The `d=3` dispatch
(`case_III_candidate_dispatch`) builds the three normals `na,nb,nc`, runs the
`Fin 3`-discriminator (`exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals` →
`exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence`) to pick a discriminating
panel `u : Fin 3` and transversal `n'`, then `fin_cases u` dispatches to the
three (already general-`k`) arm closers W7/W8/W9c. So CHAIN's new content is the
`d`-candidate generalization of *that dispatch shell* + the `⋀^{d−1}` duality
the discriminator rests on — **not** a rewrite of the arm-realization layer.

### (b) The producer-shape mismatch — the load-bearing flag (clause (ii))

**FLAG (motive/producer-level; do NOT force a leaf signature past it).** The
23a-carried `hdispatch` (`Theorem55.lean:2225`, =
`case_III_realization_all_k.hdispatch`, = `case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k.hcand`)
takes a **fixed `v,a,b,c` 4-tuple** with the `d=3` chain shape (`eₐ:va`,
`e_b:vb`, `e_c:ac`, the two degree-2 closures `hclv`/`hcla`). This is the data
`case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k` extracts via `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`
(`Reduction.lean:383`) — which, verified, produces **only a fixed 4-tuple, not a
length-`d` chain** (the OD-2/OD-3 verdict). But KT's general-`d` Lemma 6.13
**needs the whole length-`d` chain `v₀…v_d`** to build the `d` candidates
(6.54/6.56/6.57). At `d=3` the chain `v₀v₁v₂v₃` *is* exactly `c—a—v—b` (the
4-tuple `v,a,b,c` with `v₁=v` deg-2, `v₂=a` deg-2 in `G₁`, `v₀=b`, `v₃=c`
endpoints), so the fixed-4-tuple dispatch *is* the length-3 chain dispatch and
the carried shape is faithful. At `d≥4` it is **not**: the fixed 4-tuple is too
short, and the carried `hdispatch` cannot be discharged from it.

**Consequence.** CHAIN cannot be a pure "discharge the carried `hdispatch` at
general `k`" — the *producer/extractor that supplies `hdispatch`'s premises must
be reshaped* to extract and pass a length-`d` chain. Concretely, three coupled
changes:
1. **the chain extractor** (`exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`) must produce a
   length-`d` chain `v₀…v_d` (a Phase-20-shape combinatorial lemma — KT Lemma
   4.6/4.8; the **ENTRY** layer, OD-2/OD-3 verdict: "new combinatorial leaf");
2. **the producer** (`case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k`) must thread that chain
   into its `hcand` slot (its `hcand`/`hdispatch` shape changes from fixed
   4-tuple to length-`d` chain);
3. **the dispatch** (CHAIN's deliverable) consumes the chain.
This is a genuine **motive/producer-shape change**, not a numeral lift, and it
**couples CHAIN to ENTRY**: the dispatch's input shape is the chain extractor's
output shape. **Recommendation:** CHAIN and ENTRY co-design the chain-data shape
at CHAIN open (the `hdispatch`/`hcand` signature is the contract between them);
23b should not freeze the dispatch signature before the chain-data record is
agreed with ENTRY. The 23a `hdispatch` carry is **correct as the `d=3` instance
contract** (the `k=2` wrapper fills it from `case_III_candidate_dispatch`), and
stays green through 23a/ASSEMBLY-at-`d=3`; it is the *general-`d`* shape that
must grow. This is exactly the "honest open decision the coordinator/user
adjudicates" clause-(ii) calls for — see OD-6 / OD-7 below.

### (c) Buildable-leaf sequence for CHAIN

Smallest-buildable, dependency-ordered. The two hard cores (chain bookkeeping
CHAIN-1/2; duality CHAIN-3/4) are **largely independent** and feed the dispatch
assembly CHAIN-5. Each leaf re-greens its file on the still-green tree (additive
restating; the `Fin 4`/`d=3` decls stay as `d=3` wrappers so the `d=3` line
never regresses). **CHAIN-0/CHAIN-5 are gated by the (b) flag** — the dispatch
signature depends on the ENTRY chain-data contract.

- **CHAIN-1 — the `d`-fold candidate augment** (`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`).
  Generalize `linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow` (one `Unit`
  candidate) to a `Fin d`-indexed / `d`-fold `Sum` augment: given the base
  family `Sum.elim rn ro` independent and `d` candidate rows each differing
  from a genuine row by a span-member, the augmented family is independent.
  Graph-free over `ScrewSpace k`; the `linearIndependent_sumElim_unit_iff`
  row-space criterion generalizes to a finite-iterated form. *Signature
  (target):* `linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow_chain {d}
  (hindep : LinearIndependent ℝ (Sum.elim (Sum.elim rn cand) ro)) … :
  LinearIndependent ℝ (Sum.elim (Sum.elim rn cand') ro)` where `cand : Fin d →
  Dual ℝ (α → ScrewSpace k)`. No `d=3` content; pure linear algebra.
- **CHAIN-2 — the chain matrix bookkeeping (eqs. 6.59–6.64)** (`CaseIII/`, new
  file or extend `Candidate`). The per-candidate-`i` reduction of `R(G,pᵢ)`
  (6.60) to the `Mᵢ ⊕ R(G₁∖(v₀v₂)_{i*},q₁)` form (6.64), via the column op
  (add `vᵢ`-cols to `vᵢ₊₁`-cols), the substitution (6.59), the row
  correspondence (6.62), and the redundant-row weights `λ` (6.52, the Claim
  6.11 redundancy — **reuse `exists_redundant_panelRow_ab_of_finrank_eq`,
  general & GREEN**). The ±r chain (6.66) is the degree-2 fact "in a manner
  similar to (6.44)". *This is the index-heavy generalization of the
  `caseIIICandidate`/`case_III_old_new_blocks`/`case_III_rank_certification`
  chain (now `q : α × Fin 4`-shaped) to a `Fin d`-indexed candidate family.*
  Heaviest mechanical leaf; KT calls it "exactly the same as `d=3`."
- **CHAIN-3 — the `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})` duality bricks** (`Meet.lean`).
  Re-state `extensor_mem_range_map_subtype_of_mem`,
  `exists_smul_eq_of_mem_range_map_subtype`,
  `exteriorPower_basis_toDual_eq_pairingDual_comp_map`,
  `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` at `⋀[ℝ]^{d−1}(Fin (d+1)→ℝ)` with the
  general `finrank(⋀^{d−1}W) = (finrank W).choose (d−1)`
  (`exteriorPower.finrank_eq`; at `dim W = d−1` this is `1`). The route is
  general mathlib (`exteriorPower.map_injective_field`, `map_apply_ιMulti`,
  `pairingDual_ιMulti_ιMulti`, `topEquiv`/`pairingDualEquiv` mirrors); the
  `dim Φ̃ = D−1` / `dim Ω = 1` count generalizes from `wedgeFixedLeft`'s range
  count. **Build LAZILY at concrete grade `(d−1, d+1)` — do NOT build a general
  Hodge-star / regressive-product API (KT never needs it; §1/§"CHAIN" hard
  core 2).** *Risk:* `finrank_sup_range_wedgeFixedLeft` (the `dim Φ̃ = 5` at
  `d=3`) is the most `d=3`-specific count; its general form (`dim` of the sum
  of `d−1` fixed-vector-wedge ranges) is the real new lemma here.
- **CHAIN-4 — the `Fin (d+1)` incidence + Claim-6.12 discriminator**
  (`Claim612.lean`). Re-state `exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals`
  (the `d+1`-point incidence pattern of eq. 6.67), the dispatch-internal
  bricks (`omitTwoExtensor_eq_extensor_kept`, `…_homogenize_…`,
  `exists_independent_perp_pair`, `exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence`),
  `case_III_claim612` (the span-`D` existential, **reusing the general
  `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` (landed 23a Leaf 2) + Lemma 2.1
  `omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent_of_li` (general & GREEN)**), and
  `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence` at `ScrewSpace (d−1)`,
  `Fin d` candidates, `complementIso (k:=d−1)(j:=d−1)`. Consumes CHAIN-3.
  *This is the eq. (6.67) finish + the `Mᵢ`-fails-iff-`r⊥C(Lᵢ)` disjunction.*
- **CHAIN-5 — the `d`-chain dispatch assembly** (`CaseIII/Realization.lean`).
  Replace `case_III_candidate_dispatch`: given the length-`d` chain data +
  fresh `e₀` + the IH-generic base realization `(G₁,q₁)`, build the `d`
  candidates (CHAIN-2), apply the discriminator (CHAIN-4) to pick a
  full-rank `Mᵢ`, and close via the (already general-`k`) arm closer for that
  `i` (the `ρᵢ`-relabel chain generalizing W9c's single `a↔v` swap). **Gated
  by the (b) flag** — its `hdispatch`/`hcand` signature is the
  CHAIN↔ENTRY contract (the length-`d` chain record). Discharges the
  general-`d` `hdispatch` carried by `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k_all_k` (once that
  carry's shape grows to the length-`d` chain, (b)). Keep the `d=3` dispatch as
  a `k=2`/length-3 wrapper so the `d=3` line stays green.

### (d) Green-modulo boundary CHAIN hands downstream

After CHAIN, the carried `hdispatch` is **discharged at general `k`** (modulo
the (b) producer reshape, which CHAIN co-owns with ENTRY). CHAIN additionally
**unblocks the M4-forget producer** `exists_extensor_eq_panelSupportExtensor`
(it routes through the `⋀²ℝ⁴` duality `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join`,
CHAIN-3) — so once CHAIN-3 lands, **`hforget_k`** (the M4 forget map,
`hasPanelRealization_of_generic`, `GenericityDevice.lean:1936/1945`) lifts to
general `k`, and **through it `hbase_k`/`hcut_k`/`hcontract_k`** (every
conditioned-pair producer routes its bare `HasPanelRealization` half through the
forget map — the 23a Leaf-5 finding). **So the four 23a-carried producers fold
into CHAIN's tail** (after CHAIN-3's duality), as the §"CHAIN" scope expansion
predicted — see (e) OD-7 for the fold-vs-successor decision. What CHAIN does
**not** discharge, leaving to downstream:
- **ENTRY** owns the length-`d` chain *extraction* (the reshaped
  `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` → chain; Lemma 4.6 dichotomy + Lemma 4.8
  split-off + the short-cycle base Lemma 5.4 branch) and the `hD : 6 ≤
  bodyBarDim n` floor lift. The chain-data record shape is the CHAIN↔ENTRY
  contract ((b)).
- **ASSEMBLY** composes the honest general-`d` Theorem 5.5 (the `hdispatch`/
  four-producer carries now discharged), re-greens `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`
  + `hub`, derives Thm 5.6, states Conjecture 1.2.

### (e) CHAIN-specific open decisions

- **OD-6 — DECIDED: two leaves within one CHAIN sub-phase (no new letter for
  the duality), but with a CHAIN/ENTRY co-design dependency.** The two hard
  cores are dependency-ordered into one layer: the `⋀^{d−1}` duality (CHAIN-3)
  is *consumed by* the Claim-6.12 discriminator (CHAIN-4), which is *consumed
  by* the dispatch assembly (CHAIN-5); the chain bookkeeping (CHAIN-1/2) feeds
  CHAIN-5 in parallel. They are five leaves of **one** sub-phase 23b, not a
  split — the arm-realization engine they all feed is already general-`k`
  (verified (a)), so neither core stands alone as a deliverable. *Rationale for
  not minting a separate duality letter:* the duality is not a self-contained
  target (it has no consumer outside CHAIN-4/5 and the M4-forget lift), unlike
  21a's meet foundations (which seeded the whole panel layer). If CHAIN-2's
  index bookkeeping proves larger than estimated, **split at contact** into 23b
  (duality + discriminator CHAIN-3/4, which also unblocks the four producers)
  + a later-minted letter (chain bookkeeping CHAIN-1/2/5) — but open as one.
- **OD-7 — DECIDED: the four 23a-carried producers fold into CHAIN's tail
  (after CHAIN-3), not a dedicated successor sub-phase.** Verified ((d)): the
  M4-forget `exists_extensor_eq_panelSupportExtensor` is *the same `⋀²ℝ⁴`
  duality* CHAIN-3 lifts, and `hbase_k`/`hcut_k`/`hcontract_k` route through M4
  for their bare half. So the producer lift is a **direct corollary of CHAIN-3**
  (numeral pass on the producers once their one `Fin 4`-duality reach-in lifts),
  not new mathematics — folding it avoids a successor sub-phase that would
  re-open the same files. *Caveat:* the producers also carry `Fin 4` panel
  geometry beyond the forget call (the 23a Leaf-5 finding said they "bottom out
  in `q : α × Fin 4` panel geometry **and** the duality"); the detailed-build
  recon at CHAIN open must confirm the *only* genuinely-`d=3` reach-in is the
  duality (i.e. the rest is the numeral pass), else the fold is larger than a
  corollary. Present as a fold with this caveat flagged.
- **OD-4 — FLAGGED (genuinely open; do NOT pre-commit a route).** KT's eq.
  (6.67) `d+1`-points step is stated **via algebraic independence** (p. 698,
  verbatim: *"the set of the coefficients … is algebraically independent over
  the rational field. Therefore, for any `j` hyperplanes among them, their
  intersection forms a `(d−j)`-dimensional affine space."*). The `d=3` N3a was
  **AVOIDED** (existence/Zariski route — one explicit seed with the 4 points
  affinely independent, via explicit triple-intersection + cross-products,
  `AlgebraicIndependence.md` row #106). *Unsettled at general `d`:* whether an
  explicit `d+1`-point construction exists (existence route again) or the
  symbolic `j`-hyperplanes-meet-in-`(d−j)`-flat genuinely forces the
  alg-independence hammer. The `d=3` explicit construction (`p₁` = triple
  intersection, `pᵢ = p₁ + sᵢ·(nⱼ×nₖ)`) does **not** obviously generalize: at
  `d+1` panels in `ℝ^d` the "intersection of `d−1` of them is a line" needs the
  `j`-hyperplanes-meet-in-`(d−j)`-flat fact, which is *exactly* the
  alg-independence consequence KT states. **Cross-check `AlgebraicIndependence.md`
  row #107(b):** that row already scopes this as "uncertain whether a NEW site"
  and defers the confirm to CHAIN open — this recon **does not resolve it**;
  it confirms the question is real (the `d=3` explicit route is not obviously
  liftable) and routes the decision to the CHAIN detailed-build recon. *If the
  symbolic route is forced,* it is a new alg-independence site (a `Fin (d+1)`
  generalization of the existence brick `exists_affineIndependent_of_det_…`,
  possibly needing `AlgebraicIndependent`-driven non-vanishing of the `d+1`
  homogenization determinants) — a CHAIN-4 sub-leaf, not new infra (the
  alg-independence machinery is live from 22d). **Note (b) interaction:** the
  seed `q` is the IH-generic base `(G₁,q₁)` realization, already
  `AlgebraicIndependent ℚ`-carrying (the 23a-lifted `case_III_nested_rank_lower`
  consumes it), so the symbolic route's hypothesis is in hand if needed.
- **OD-1 (carried from §4, re-confirmed for CHAIN/ENTRY).** The short-cycle
  base (KT Lemma 5.4, "if `G` is a cycle of length ≤ `d`, done by Lemma 5.4")
  is a **real branch of the general-`d` chain entry** (KT p. 692), unlike `d=3`
  (triangle floor handled inline). Whether CHAIN's dispatch can assume the chain
  branch (ENTRY discharging the cycle branch separately) or must handle a degenerate
  chain is an ENTRY-contract question — flag at CHAIN open, do not pre-commit.

## CHAIN↔ENTRY chain-data contract

**Status:** settled 2026-06-17 (docs-only design-settle pass, source-verified
against KT §6.4.2 eqs. 6.46–6.67 read end-to-end + the landed `d=3` producer/
consumer/dispatch in tree). This section freezes the **shared interface** the
recon's flag (b) (§"CHAIN"(b)) left open: the length-`d` chain-data shape that
the ENTRY extractor produces and the CHAIN-5 dispatch consumes. **Authoritative
for the interface only** — it does NOT build any leaf, does NOT decide OD-4 (the
eq.-6.67 alg-independence route), and does NOT mint ENTRY. Every CHAIN leaf and
the ENTRY extractor is to be authored against the frozen shape below.

### C.0 — Where the chain data actually flows (the producer reshape, verified)

The recon's flag (b) located the carried `hdispatch` shape, but the
**load-bearing structural fact for the contract is one level deeper**: the chain
*extraction* does **not** live in a separate ENTRY lemma feeding the dispatch —
it lives **inside the producer** `case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k`
(`CaseIII/Arms.lean:777`). Verified in tree (Arms.lean:828–857, the `|V(G)| ≥ 4`
arm): the producer (i) calls `Graph.exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`
(`Reduction.lean:383`) to get the 4-tuple `v,a,b,c` + edges, (ii) picks a fresh
`e₀`, (iii) proves `G.splitOff v a b e₀` is a smaller minimal-0-dof graph + is
simple, (iv) pulls its **generic** realization `hsplitGP` from the IH's GP
conjunct, and (v) feeds all of that to `hcand`. So the **producer is the chain
extractor's only consumer**, and the `hcand`/`hdispatch` premise bundle is the
*output type of the extractor* re-expressed as the *input type of the dispatch*.

**Consequence for the contract.** The reshape is **three decls changing in
lockstep, all carrying the identical premise bundle** (verified byte-identical
across the three):
1. `Graph.exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` (`Reduction.lean:383`) — the **producer
   side** (ENTRY): its `∃`-output tuple is the record.
2. `case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k.hcand` (`Arms.lean:797–807`) **and** the
   identical extraction-arm body (Arms.lean:828–857) — the **producer** threads
   the record into `hcand`.
3. `case_III_realization_all_k.hdispatch` (`Realization.lean:699–709`) and
   `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k_all_k.hdispatch` (`Theorem55.lean:2230–2240`,
   wrapped under a per-`G` `∀`) — the **consumer side** (CHAIN-5): the carried
   crux hypothesis whose shape must be the record.

The `d=3` premise bundle, verbatim (the four files agree):
```
(v a b c : α) (eₐ e_b e_c e₀ : β)
v ∈ V(G) → a ∈ V(G) → b ∈ V(G) → c ∈ V(G) →
a ≠ v → b ≠ v → b ≠ a → c ≠ v → c ≠ a → b ≠ c →
eₐ ≠ e_b → eₐ ≠ e_c →
G.IsLink eₐ v a → G.IsLink e_b v b → G.IsLink e_c a c →
(∀ e x, G.IsLink e v x → e = eₐ ∨ e = e_b) →
(∀ e x, G.IsLink e a x → e = eₐ ∨ e = e_c) →
e₀ ∉ E(G) →
(G.splitOff v a b e₀).deficiency n = 0 →
HasGenericFullRankRealization k n (G.splitOff v a b e₀) →
HasGenericFullRankRealization k n G
```

### C.1 — The length-`d` chain-data record (item 1)

KT §6.4.2 (eqs. 6.46–6.59, p. 692–694) needs the **whole chain `v₀v₁…v_d`** with
`d_G(vᵢ)=2` for `1≤i≤d−1`, the base framework on `G₁ = splitOff at v₁` (KT's
`G^{v₀v₂}_{v₁}`), and the redundant-`(v₀v₂)` row of Claim 6.11. The recommended
shape is a **`structure`** (not an anonymous `∃`-tuple — at `d=3` the tuple is
already 17 fields; at general `d` the vertex/edge sequences are `Fin`-indexed
families and an anonymous tuple is unmaintainable). Grounded field-by-field in
the KT chain definition + the landed `splitOff` API (`Operations.lean:579`,
`splitOff_isLink` 619):

```
/-- Length-`d` Case-III chain data (KT §6.4.2, the chain v₀v₁…v_d). -/
structure ChainData (G : Graph α β) (n : ℕ) where
  d        : ℕ                         -- the chain length = the body-bar dim index (d = k+1)
  hd       : 1 ≤ d                     -- nondegenerate chain (d ≥ 1; d=3 ⟹ 2)
  vtx      : Fin (d + 1) → α           -- v₀ … v_d  (KT 6.46: the chain vertices)
  edge     : Fin d → β                 -- the chain edges: edge i = vᵢvᵢ₊₁
  e₀       : β                         -- the fresh short-circuit label for the v₁-split (6.46)
  -- KT chain conditions:
  vtx_mem    : ∀ i, vtx i ∈ V(G)
  vtx_inj    : Function.Injective vtx                       -- the vᵢ are distinct (6.67 affine-indep prep)
  link       : ∀ i : Fin d, G.IsLink (edge i) (vtx i.castSucc) (vtx i.succ)
  edge_inj   : Function.Injective edge
  deg_two    : ∀ i : Fin d, 1 ≤ (i : ℕ) → (i : ℕ) ≤ d - 1 → -- d_G(vᵢ)=2 for 1≤i≤d−1 (6.46):
                 (∀ e x, G.IsLink e (vtx i.castSucc?) x →    -- every vᵢ-edge is edge(i−1) or edge(i)
                   e = edge (prev i) ∨ e = edge i)            -- (the degree-2 closure, KT's two-edge fact)
  e₀_fresh   : e₀ ∉ E(G)
```
(The `deg_two` field is sketched against the `splitOff_isLink` two-edge-closure
pattern the `d=3` `hclv`/`hcla` carry; the exact `Fin`-arithmetic of "the two
edges incident to `vᵢ` are `edge (i−1)` and `edge i`" is a build detail for
ENTRY — the *content* is "interior chain vertices have degree exactly two, with
their two edges being the two chain edges at that index", which is precisely
KT's `d_G(vᵢ)=2`.) **The base framework `(G₁,q₁)` is NOT a record field** — it is
produced *inside* the dispatch from the IH (as the `d=3` producer does at
Arms.lean:854, pulling `hsplitGP` from `(hIH …).1`); the record carries only the
*combinatorial* chain. The `splitOff` that builds `G₁` is `G.splitOff v₁ v₀ v₂ e₀`
(splice the `v₀v₂` edge, delete `v₁`), matching the landed `splitOff v a b e₀`
with `(v,a,b) = (v₁,v₀,v₂)` — see C.4.

**Carried minimality / conditioned-IH hypotheses** stay *outside* the record, on
the producer/dispatch signature exactly as the `d=3` bundle has them: `hG :
G.IsMinimalKDof n 0`, `hnoRigid`, `hSimple`, the IH conjunction `hIH`, and the
per-split `(G.splitOff …).deficiency n = 0`. The record is the *chain witness*;
the realization/minimality data is the surrounding induction context (this
matches the `d=3` split: `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` returns only the
combinatorial tuple, and `case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k` supplies `hG`/`hIH`/
`hsplitGP` from its own context).

### C.2 — Producer-side signature (item 2): the reshaped extractor

ENTRY reshapes `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` from the fixed 4-tuple to a
`ChainData` producer. Target signature (general `d`, against the record):
```
theorem Graph.exists_chainData_of_noRigid [DecidableEq β] [Finite α] [Finite β]
    {G : Graph α β} {n : ℕ}
    (hD : (some-D-floor) ≤ bodyBarDim n)        -- ENTRY lifts the d=3 `6 ≤ bodyBarDim n` floor
    (hV : (d + 1) ≤ V(G).ncard)                 -- enough vertices for a length-d chain
    (hG : G.IsMinimalKDof n 0)
    (hnp : ∀ H : Graph α β, ¬ H.IsProperRigidSubgraph G n) :
    G.ChainData n                                -- the record (or the cycle-branch disjunct, OD-1)
```
This is KT **Lemma 4.6 (chain) + Lemma 4.8 (split-off minimality)** at general
`d` — the "new combinatorial leaf for ENTRY" the OD-2/OD-3 verdict named (not
subsumed in Phase-20, which produces only the single degree-2 split). The
`d=3` `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` becomes the `d=3` instance / a wrapper that
fills `ChainData` with `d = 3` and `(vtx 0,1,2,3) = (b,v,a,c)` (C.4). **The
hD floor is ENTRY's to lift** (the `6 ≤ bodyBarDim n` of the `d=3` extractor is
the `d=3` regime; the general floor is the body-bar-dim ↔ chain-length relation,
a separate ENTRY obligation — see §"CHAIN"(d), `hD`-floor lift).

### C.3 — Consumer-side signature (item 3): the CHAIN-5 dispatch

CHAIN-5's dispatch (`hdispatch`/`hcand`) takes the record + the surrounding
induction context and produces the realization. Target shape:
```
(hdispatch : ∀ (cd : G.ChainData n),
    (G.splitOff (cd.vtx 1) (cd.vtx 0) (cd.vtx 2) cd.e₀).deficiency n = 0 →
    HasGenericFullRankRealization k n
        (G.splitOff (cd.vtx 1) (cd.vtx 0) (cd.vtx 2) cd.e₀) →   -- the base (G₁,q₁) seed
    HasGenericFullRankRealization k n G)
```
i.e. *"given the length-`d` chain, the deficiency-0 fact on `G₁ = splitOff at v₁`,
and the IH-generic base realization on `G₁`, build the `d` candidate frameworks
(CHAIN-2, eqs. 6.47/6.48/6.57/6.59), apply the `⋀^{d−1}`-duality discriminator
(CHAIN-3/4, eq. 6.67) to find a full-rank `Mᵢ`, and close via the (already
general-`k`) arm closer for that `i`."* The `G₁` here is `splitOff (vtx 1) (vtx
0) (vtx 2) e₀` — the `v₁`-split splicing `v₀v₂` — which is the *single* split the
`d=3` bundle's `(G.splitOff v a b e₀)` already names (C.4). The remaining `d−2`
candidate splits `Gᵢ = splitOff at vᵢ` (KT 6.54–6.56) are built *internally* by
the dispatch from `cd` and the isos `ρᵢ` (which are *derived* from the chain by
eq. 6.54, not carried — see C.5). **CHAIN-5's signature is frozen as this shape**
(per the (b) co-design gate); the only build-time latitude is the exact `Fin`
arithmetic of indexing `cd.vtx`/`cd.edge`.

### C.4 — The `d=3` specialization (item 4): zero-regression wrapper

At `d=3` the chain `v₀v₁v₂v₃` **is** `b—v—a—c` (verified against the `d=3`
extractor `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`, which returns `v,a,b,c` with `v`,`a`
the adjacent degree-2 pair via `eₐ`, `b` the other `v`-neighbour, `c` the other
`a`-neighbour). The record-to-tuple map:

| Record (`ChainData`, general `d`) | `d=3` value | `d=3` tuple field |
|---|---|---|
| `d` | `3` (= `k+1` at `k=2`) | — |
| `vtx 0` | `b` | `b` (the `v₀` endpoint) |
| `vtx 1` | `v` | `v` (interior, deg 2) |
| `vtx 2` | `a` | `a` (interior, deg 2 in `G₁`) |
| `vtx 3` | `c` | `c` (the `v₃` endpoint) |
| `edge 0` (= `v₀v₁` = `bv`) | `e_b` | `e_b` |
| `edge 1` (= `v₁v₂` = `va`) | `eₐ` | `eₐ` (the shared edge) |
| `edge 2` (= `v₂v₃` = `ac`) | `e_c` | `e_c` |
| `e₀` | `e₀` | `e₀` |

So **`G₁ = splitOff (vtx 1) (vtx 0) (vtx 2) e₀ = splitOff v b a e₀`** — but the
landed `d=3` bundle uses `splitOff v a b e₀` (note `a`,`b` swapped). `splitOff`
is symmetric in its `a,b` arguments (verified: `splitOff_isLink`,
`Operations.lean:619`, makes `v₀v₂` and `v₂v₀` the same `e₀`-link via the
`(x=a∧y=b) ∨ (x=b∧y=a)` disjunct), so `splitOff v a b e₀ = splitOff v b a e₀` as
graphs — the `d=3` wrapper instantiates cleanly either way. The degree-2 closures
`hclv` (every `v`-edge is `eₐ` or `e_b`) and `hcla` (every `a`-edge is `eₐ` or
`e_c`) are exactly `ChainData.deg_two` at `i=1` (vtx 1 = v: edges `edge 0 = e_b`,
`edge 1 = eₐ`) and `i=2` (vtx 2 = a: edges `edge 1 = eₐ`, `edge 2 = e_c`). **The
`d=3` line stays a zero-regression wrapper**: `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`
(the existing 4-tuple lemma) becomes the `d=3` `ChainData` constructor, and the
`theorem_55_d3`/`case_III_realization` wrappers fill `hdispatch` from the
existing `case_III_candidate_dispatch` via this map — no `d=3` proof changes,
only an adapter from the 4-tuple to the `ChainData` projection.

### C.5 — OD-1 reconciliation (item 5): the chain/cycle division of labor

KT p. 692: *"By Lemma 4.6, either `G` is a cycle of length at most `d` or `G`
has a chain of length `d`. If `G` is a cycle of length at most `d`, then we are
done by Lemma 5.4."* So the **dichotomy is upstream of the dispatch**. Pinned
division of labor:

- **The extractor (ENTRY) owns the dichotomy.** `exists_chainData_of_noRigid`
  (C.2) is where Lemma 4.6 fires. It has two honest shapes, and **OD-1 chooses
  between them at ENTRY-build, not now** — the contract is written so CHAIN-5
  works under **either**:
  1. *Extractor returns the chain only, ENTRY discharges the cycle branch
     separately* (preferred if Lemma 5.4 can be folded into the base/short-cycle
     case the way the `d=3` triangle floor was, §"23a"-OD verdict that `d=3`
     dodged 5.4). Then `exists_chainData_of_noRigid : G.ChainData n` returns a
     genuine chain, and CHAIN-5 **assumes the chain branch** — the cycle case
     never reaches the dispatch. **This is the contract's default assumption**:
     CHAIN-5's `hdispatch` consumes a `ChainData` and is *not* responsible for
     the cycle branch.
  2. *Extractor returns a disjunction* `G.ChainData n ⊕ (G is a short cycle,
     |V| ≤ D)`, and the producer routes the cycle disjunct to a **Lemma 5.4
     short-cycle realization** brick (a genuine new ENTRY leaf, risk #4, the
     Crapo–Whiteley cycle realization). CHAIN-5 still only sees `ChainData`.
- **CHAIN never handles the cycle branch.** Under both shapes, CHAIN-5's input
  is a `ChainData`; the cycle realization (if load-bearing) is ENTRY's. This is
  the safe pin: it does not pre-commit OD-1 (whether 5.4 is needed at all), and
  it keeps the dispatch signature stable regardless of how the dichotomy
  resolves. **ENTRY decides at build** whether the cycle branch is vacuous /
  base-folded (shape 1) or needs the 5.4 brick (shape 2); the dispatch contract
  is invariant under that choice.

### C.6 — Clause (ii): no motive/IH-level change forced by the interface

Pinning the contract did **not** surface a motive/IH-level blocker. The chain
data is purely combinatorial (`ChainData` carries no realization, no nested-IH
seed); the base framework `(G₁,q₁)` is supplied to the dispatch as the
**existing** `HasGenericFullRankRealization k n (G.splitOff …)` premise (the
`d=3` `hsplitGP` shape, already general-`k` from 23a), pulled from the *same*
0-dof IH conjunct the `d=3` producer uses (Arms.lean:854). The `d`-candidate
splits `Gᵢ` are *smaller* minimal-0-dof graphs realized by the same IH at the
same dof — **no higher-dof `G_v` GAP-6 pattern, no conditioned-pair data the
0-dof motive cannot supply**. The one genuine open question the interface
*touches* but does **not** resolve is **OD-4** (the eq.-6.67 `d+1`-points step:
existence route vs. the alg-independence hammer) — that is a CHAIN-4 *internal*
build decision, not an interface field, and the contract is invariant under it
(the record carries the chain; OD-4 concerns how the dispatch *uses* the
generic base `(G₁,q₁)`, whose `AlgebraicIndependent ℚ` data the 23a-lifted
`case_III_nested_rank_lower` already consumes). **The interface is frozen; the
two honest unknowns it routes downstream are OD-1 (ENTRY's dichotomy shape, C.5)
and OD-4 (CHAIN-4's alg-independence route), both build-time, neither a motive
change.**
