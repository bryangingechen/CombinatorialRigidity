# Phase 23 — Case III general `d` (KT Lemma 6.13): general design recon

**Status:** live design recon (decision-support doc). This is the *general,
layer-level* sub-phase-division recon for Phase 23 — the first stage of a
two-stage recon (a later dispatch does the leaf-level recon of the FIRST
sub-phase before any build). It sketches the cut-points, their dependency
order, hard cores, and the reuse/replace/add map; it does **not** attempt
full leaf-level signatures for every sub-phase. Authoritative recon for
Phase 23; `notes/Phase23a.md` / `notes/Phase23b.md` are the per-layer work logs
and point here. **Detailed leaf-level recons done so far:** §"23a" (CARRIER,
closed) and §"CHAIN — detailed leaf-level recon" (the minted **23b**, open
2026-06-17 — decides OD-6/OD-7, flags OD-4 + the producer-shape mismatch (b)).

**Audience:** the agent opening the first Phase-23 sub-phase (and the
detailed-recon dispatch that decomposes it into buildable leaves).

**Source-verified, 2026-06-17.** Every load-bearing claim below was checked
against (i) the KT paper directly — §6.4.2 Lemma 6.13, eqs. (6.46)–(6.67),
cross-read against §6.4.1 (the `d=3` Lemma 6.10 it generalizes), §4 (Lemmas
4.6/4.8/4.9), §5.1–5.2 (Lemmas 5.1–5.4, Theorems 5.5/5.6) — and (ii) the
actual landed `def`/`theorem` in tree (grade, conclusion shape). The KT
read corrected several §1.33(C) sketch cells; the corrections are flagged
inline and in *Open decisions*.

## 0. What Phase 23 is, in one paragraph

KT prove Theorem 5.5 (every minimal `k`-dof-graph has a panel-hinge
realization at rank `D(|V|−1)−k`) by induction on `|V|`, four cases. Three
cases (base, not-2-edge-connected, proper-rigid-subgraph = Case I, `k>0`
split = Case II) are dimension-general and already green in the
**`screwDim 2` / `ScrewSpace 2` / `Fin 4`-pinned** `d=3` spine. The fourth,
**Case III** (`k=0`, 2-edge-connected, no proper rigid subgraph; KT §6.4),
is the crux, and is the only case whose **argument** is currently written
`d=3`-specific: KT §6.4.1 (Lemma 6.10) does it with a *fixed* 3-candidate
dispatch (vertices `v,a,b,c`), and §6.4.2 (Lemma 6.13) generalizes it to a
length-`d` chain `v₀v₁…v_d` with `d` candidate frameworks `(G,pᵢ)` and
isomorphisms `ρᵢ`. KT, p. 692: *"The proof strategy is exactly the same as
`d = 3`."* The mathematical heart of Phase 23 is **two things**: (a) lift
the whole `screwDim 2`-pinned spine to general `screwDim k`, and (b) replace
the `d=3` Case-III dispatch with the general-`d` chain dispatch + the
`⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})` duality finish. Then complete Theorem 5.5 (general `d`),
derive Theorem 5.6 (KT §5.2 strip + projective-move-free re-add), and state
Conjecture 1.2 as a theorem.

KT's general-`d` proof, **verbatim from p. 692** (the load-bearing claim
this recon rests on): *"By Lemma 4.6, either `G` is a cycle of length at
most `d` or `G` has a chain of length `d`. If `G` is a cycle of length at
most `d`, then we are done by Lemma 5.4. Hence, let us consider the case
where `G` has a chain `v₀v₁v₂…v_d` of length `d` (where `d_G(vᵢ)=2` for
`1≤i≤d−1`)."* So the **chain entry is a genuine new dichotomy** (Lemma 4.6),
the **short-cycle base is genuinely needed** (Lemma 5.4), and the chain
interior split is **Lemma 4.8**. None of these three appear `d=3` because
`d=3` runs a fixed 3-chain `v→a→b→c` and never invokes 4.6/4.8/5.4 on the
load-bearing path (see Open decision OD-1, OD-2).

## 1. The carrier-grade fault line — the single biggest scoping fact

§1.33(C)'s row *"genericity device, prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11,
theorem_55 skeleton, Cases I & II — general & GREEN — the spine is `k`-free"*
is **wrong about the spine**, and this is the recon's most consequential
correction. The graph-side combinatorics is `n`-parametric, but the
**realization spine carries `screwDim 2` / `ScrewSpace 2` / `Fin 4`
literally**. Source-verified grades of the spine decls (the table names
them at general grade; the tree pins them at `d=3`):

| Decl | File | Grade as landed | Phase-23 action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `theorem_55_all_k`, `theorem_55_d3` | `AlgebraicInduction/Theorem55.lean:2248/2266` | `HasGenericFullRankRealization 2 n`, `hn : bodyBarDim n = screwDim 2` — **`d=3`-pinned** | re-state at `screwDim k` motive |
| `case_III_realization`, `case_III_realization_0dof` | `CaseIII/Realization.lean:665/518` | `HasGenericFullRankRealization 2 n`, `screwDim 2` — **`d=3`-pinned** | re-state at `screwDim k` |
| `case_III_nested_rank_lower` | `CaseIII/Realization.lean:561` | `q : α × Fin 4 → ℝ`, `screwDim 2` — **`d=3`-pinned**; *already consumes* `AlgebraicIndependent ℚ q` | re-state at `Fin (k+2)` / `screwDim k` |
| `case_III_candidate_dispatch` | `CaseIII/Realization.lean:181` | `q : α × Fin 4 → ℝ`, fixed `v,a,b,c` 3-candidate, `screwDim 2`, `h622lb` over `Fin 4` — **`d=3`-pinned AND structurally fixed-3-candidate** | **REPLACE** by the chain dispatch |
| `case_II_placement_eq612` | `AlgebraicInduction/CaseII.lean:71` | `screwDim k`-stated already? (check) | confirm grade in detailed recon |

**Two distinct lifts are bundled in the table's one "spine" row.** (i) A
*mechanical carrier lift* — re-state the `screwDim 2`-pinned spine decls
(`theorem_55_*`, `case_III_realization*`) at `screwDim k`; their *proofs*
compose general-grade bricks, so this is plumbing once the carrier API is
general. (ii) A *genuinely new argument* — `case_III_candidate_dispatch`
is not merely `d=3`-graded but **structurally a fixed 3-candidate dispatch**
(`v,a,b,c`, `e_a,e_b,e_c`), which is exactly KT's §6.4.1; the general-`d`
Lemma 6.13 replaces it with the `d`-candidate chain dispatch (eqs.
6.46–6.67). The recon's sub-phase cut runs **along this fault line**.

**The general-`d` carrier API (ScrewSpaceCarrier §6) is a prerequisite for
both.** The opaque `ScrewSpace k` `def` landed (22l) with a general-`k`
`mk`/`val`/`equivExteriorPower`/instance API (`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`),
but every *consumer* in the spine was migrated at `k=2` only. The
general-`d` "part 2" (ScrewSpaceCarrier-design.md §6) is the migration of
those consumers to symbolic `k` — and §6 flags the real unknown: at `k=2`,
`screwDim 2 = 6` is concrete and many proofs lean on `fin_cases`/`decide`;
at general `k`, `screwDim k = (k+2).choose 2` is symbolic and the
`screwBasis`/`annihRow` coordinate machinery (hard-part (d)) gets exercised
symbolically for the first time. **This recon folds the general-`d`
carrier-API work into sub-phase 23a (below), not a standalone sub-phase** —
the migration surface *is* the carrier-lift surface, and §6's whole point
was to shape the API against the general-`d` usage rather than freeze it
speculatively.

---

## 2. The sub-phase division

Four layers, dependency-ordered, tracked by **stable codes** —
**`CARRIER`**, **`CHAIN`**, **`ENTRY`**, **`ASSEMBLY`**. The cut isolates the
**mechanical carrier lift** (`CARRIER`) from the **new chain argument**
(`CHAIN`), puts the **base ingredients** the chain entry needs (`ENTRY`) where
they actually block, and ends with **assembly + Thm 5.6 + Conjecture 1.2**
(`ASSEMBLY`). The first layer is `CARRIER`; rationale in §3.

> **Naming convention (set 2026-06-17).** Layers are referred to by these
> codes until they open; a **letter (23a, 23b, …) plus a `notes/Phase23X.md`
> work log are minted only when a layer is about to open**, so a later split
> (e.g. `CHAIN` into two) does not renumber-churn the rest. **`CARRIER` is the
> opening layer = the minted `23a`** (its leaf-level recon is §"23a" below, its
> work log is `notes/Phase23a.md`); `CHAIN`/`ENTRY`/`ASSEMBLY` stay code-only
> until their turn. This is the project's standing "mint a sub-letter only when
> its turn comes" discipline (`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`; top-level
> `CLAUDE.md` *When this commit opens a phase*), refined to use codes meanwhile.

### `CARRIER` (the opening layer = sub-phase 23a) — General-`d` carrier lift of the spine

**Scope.** Lift the `screwDim 2`/`ScrewSpace 2`/`Fin 4`-pinned realization
spine to symbolic `screwDim k`, and complete the ScrewSpaceCarrier §6
general-`d` consumer migration in step. This is the carrier-API "part 2"
the 22l refactor unblocked but deferred. Concretely: re-state
`theorem_55_all_k` / `theorem_55_d3` (→ a general `theorem_55` at the
`screwDim k` motive), `case_III_realization` / `_0dof` /
`case_III_nested_rank_lower`, the `case_II_*` placement bricks, and the
GenericityDevice / Coupling / CaseI consumers, replacing `Fin 4` →
`Fin (k+2)`, `screwDim 2` → `screwDim k`, `HasGenericFullRankRealization 2`
→ `… k`, and re-greening each file along the import spine
(RigidityMatrix → PanelLayer → Pinning → PanelHinge → GenericityDevice →
Coupling → CaseI → CaseII → CaseIII → Theorem55). The Case-III *graph
dispatch* (`case_III_candidate_dispatch`) is **out of 23a scope** — it is
replaced wholesale in CHAIN, so 23a leaves the Case-III `hsplit` arm carrying
the `d=3` dispatch as an explicit hypothesis (green-modulo, the project's
standing idiom) and lifts everything else.

**Hard core.** The symbolic-`k` stress on the `screwBasis`/`annihRow`
coordinate machinery (ScrewSpaceCarrier §6, hard-part (d)) and on the
`screwDim k = (k+2).choose 2` arithmetic that `d=3` discharged by `decide`.
Not deep mathematics — but the *largest* mechanical surface in Phase 23, and
the one most likely to surface a needs-thought transport (per §6, the
general-`k` coordinate transport is unproven at symbolic grade; the d=3
probe found it defeq-free at `k=2` only).

**Dependency position.** First — everything downstream is stated over the
carrier, so the chain dispatch (CHAIN) and the duality (also CHAIN) must be
written at general grade, which presupposes the spine is general grade.

**Reuse/replace/add map** (keyed to §1.33(C), source-corrected):
- *Reuse verbatim, already general & GREEN:* Lemma 2.1
  `omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent_of_li` (`Extensor.lean:563`, `{e:ℕ}`),
  Claim 6.11 `exists_redundant_panelRow_ab_of_finrank_eq`
  (`CaseIII/Candidate.lean:126`, `screwDim k`/`ScrewSpace k`/`Fin (k+2)` —
  **verified general**), `linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow`
  (`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean:1231`, `ScrewSpace k`, graph-free), the
  `complementIso`/`topEquiv`/`pairingDualEquiv` meet API (`Meet.lean`,
  `{j:ℕ} (hj : j ≤ k+2)` — dimension-parametric).
- *Re-state at general grade (lift, this sub-phase):* the spine table in §1.
- *Add:* the general-`k` consumer migration (ScrewSpaceCarrier §6).

### CHAIN — The general-`d` Case-III chain dispatch + the `⋀^{d−1}` duality

**Scope.** Replace the fixed-3-candidate `case_III_candidate_dispatch` with
the general-`d` chain dispatch of Lemma 6.13: given the base framework
`(G₁,q₁)` on the chain-split `G₁` and the isos `ρᵢ` (eq. 6.54), build the
`d` candidate frameworks `(G,p₀),…,(G,p_{d−1})` (eqs. 6.47/6.48/6.57/6.59),
do the matrix bookkeeping (eqs. 6.49–6.64) that embeds `R(G₁,q₁)` as a
submatrix and reduces each `R(G,pᵢ)` to a top-left `D×D` block `Mᵢ` plus
`R(G₁∖(v₀v₂)_{i*}, q₁)`, establish the "±r chain" (eq. 6.66) so each `Mᵢ`
fails full rank iff `r ⊥ C(Lᵢ)`, and finish via the `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})`
duality + Lemma 2.1 (eq. 6.67): take `d+1` points `p₀…p_d` (one per panel
incidence pattern), whose `(d−1)`-extensors of `d−1`-subsets span a
`(d+1 choose d−1) = D`-dimensional space, forcing some `Mᵢ` to have full
rank.

**Scope expansion (23a Leaf-5 build-contact finding — corrects §"23a"(a)/(d)
and §1).** The recon assumed the realization spine was "general & GREEN" modulo
*only* this chain dispatch. False: lifting the spine (23a Leaf 5,
`theorem_55_minimalKDof_k_all_k`) found that the **base / cut / Case-I / M4-
forgetful-map** realization producers — `theorem_55_base_producer`,
`case_cut_edge_realization{,_gp}`, `case_I_dispatch` (+ `case_I_realization_h65`),
and `hasPanelRealization_of_generic` — are **also `d=3`-pinned**: each bottoms
out in `Fin 4` panel geometry and the `⋀²ℝ⁴` duality
`exists_extensor_eq_panelSupportExtensor` (the forget map provably calls it,
`GenericityDevice.lean:1936/1945`; every conditioned-pair producer routes
through the forget map for its bare `HasPanelRealization` half). They are **not**
liftable by 23a's numeral pass (unlike the inductive CaseII/CaseIII arms, which
transport the IH realization additively). 23a therefore carries them as four
further explicit `h…` hypotheses (`hbase_k`/`hcut_k`/`hcontract_k`/`hforget_k`,
all green-modulo, never `sorry`; the `d=3` wrapper fills them zero-carry). **So
CHAIN's `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})` duality is the prerequisite to lift these four
producers off `Fin 4`** — that lift is added to CHAIN's deliverables (**OD-7
decided 2026-06-17: fold into CHAIN's tail after the duality CHAIN-3, not a
dedicated successor — they are a direct corollary of the duality lift; caveat
flagged in §"CHAIN — detailed leaf-level recon" (e)**), on top of the chain
dispatch below. Detail: `notes/Phase23a.md` *Hand-off* + Leaf-5 *Decisions*
entry; the leaf plan + the producer-shape flag (b) are §"CHAIN — detailed
leaf-level recon".

**Hard core.** Two parts, both genuinely new:
1. **The `d`-fold chain bookkeeping (eqs. 6.59–6.64).** Index-heavy but
   KT calls it "exactly the same as `d=3`." The reusable graph-free
   `linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow` augments by **one** Unit
   candidate; the chain needs `d` candidates indexed `0…d−1`, so this is
   the augment generalized to a `d`-fold `Sum`/`Fin d`-indexed family +
   the row-correspondence eq. (6.62)/(6.66) along the chain. The
   `case_III_candidate_dispatch` body (a fixed `v,a,b,c` term, ~hundreds of
   lines) is the `d=3` template to generalize.
2. **The `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})` duality (the N3b analog).** Replaces the
   bespoke `⋀²ℝ⁴` route. Per §1.33(D) (source-confirmed): do **NOT** build
   a general Hodge-star / regressive-product / star-operator API — KT never
   needs it; the whole content is "the join of `d−1` points spanning a
   `(d−2)`-flat = the meet of the panels containing it, as the same Plücker
   line," which is the **top-power-is-1-dimensional** fact. The route that
   generalizes is the 22f "happy accident":
   `extensor_mem_range_map_subtype_of_mem` +
   `exists_smul_eq_of_mem_range_map_subtype` (`Meet.lean:648/676`) — place
   both members in `range(exteriorPower.map (d−1) W.subtype)`, which is
   `(W choose d−1)`-dim. **Source-verified nuance / correction to (D):**
   those two lemmas as landed are **`Fin 4`/`⋀²`-PINNED**
   (`W : Submodule ℝ (Fin 4 → ℝ)`, `⋀[ℝ]^2`, `finrank_exteriorPower_two_eq_one`).
   The *route* generalizes (it rests on general mathlib —
   `exteriorPower.finrank_eq`, `exteriorPower.map_injective_field`,
   `map_apply_ιMulti` + the general `topEquiv`/`pairingDualEquiv` mirrors),
   but the lemmas themselves must be **re-stated** at `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})`
   with the general `finrank (⋀^{d−1} W) = (dim W choose d−1)`. This is
   "modest, mostly-mathlib API at concrete grade," not a verbatim reuse —
   the (D) cell "ALREADY PARTLY LANDED" is true only as a *template*.

**Dependency position.** After 23a (needs the general-grade carrier + spine
to state its conclusion `HasGenericFullRankRealization k n G`). **OD-6 decided
at the CHAIN open (23b, 2026-06-17): five leaves within ONE sub-phase** (the
arm-realization engine they feed is already general-`k`, so neither hard core
stands alone as a deliverable; split at contact only if the chain bookkeeping
proves larger than estimated). The detailed leaf plan + the load-bearing
producer-shape flag are §"CHAIN — detailed leaf-level recon" below.

**Reuse/replace/add map:**
- *Reuse verbatim:* Claim 6.11 (the chain's redundant `(v₀v₂)_{i*}` row is
  "always exists by Claim 6.11," KT p. 693), Lemma 2.1 (the eq. 6.67
  span-`D` finish, KT p. 698).
- *Replace:* `case_III_candidate_dispatch` (fixed-3 → `d`-chain); the
  `⋀²ℝ⁴` N3b leaf (`complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join`,
  `exteriorPower_basis_toDual_eq_pairingDual_comp_map`, both `Fin 4`-pinned
  in `Meet.lean`) → `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})`.
- *Add:* the `d`-fold candidate augment; the chain row-correspondence
  (eq. 6.62), the ±r chain (eq. 6.66); the `d+1`-points-in-general-position
  construction (eq. 6.67) — a **new algebraic-independence site** (the
  panel coefficients are alg-indep over ℚ so any `j` hyperplanes meet in a
  `(d−j)`-flat; AlgebraicIndependence.md row, see OD-4).

### ENTRY — Chain-entry ingredients: Lemma 4.6 dichotomy + Lemma 5.4 short-cycle base + Lemma 4.8 split-off

**Scope.** The three ingredients KT's general-`d` Case III invokes *to
enter* the chain argument, which `d=3` did not need on the load-bearing
path: (4.6) the chain-or-short-cycle dichotomy (a degree-2 minimal-0-dof
graph with no proper rigid subgraph is a short cycle or has a length-`d`
chain), (5.4) the short-cycle base (a cycle of length `3≤|V|≤D` realizes as
an infinitesimally rigid nonparallel panel-hinge framework — Crapo–Whiteley
[4]/[34]), and (4.8) the chain-interior split-off minimality (`Gᵢ = splitOff
at vᵢ` is minimal 0-dof). **Whether this is a standalone sub-phase or folds
into CHAIN is an open decision (OD-1/OD-2/OD-3)** — it hinges on whether 4.6/
4.8 already exist subsumed in the green Phase-20 `minimal_kdof_reduction`
machinery and whether 5.4 is genuinely on the Lean-load-bearing path or a
KT-narrative dependency (the `d=3` Case III dodged 5.4 entirely — §1.33(B.1)).

**Hard core.** Lemma 5.4 (the cycle realization) if it is genuinely
load-bearing: it is its own deferred sub-phase per risk #4 (the
panel-realization of a cycle with independent hinge extensors = the
Crapo–Whiteley projective fact), the one piece here that is real new panel
content rather than a Phase-20 graph fact. 4.6/4.8 are combinatorial and may
already be in tree.

**Dependency position.** Feeds CHAIN's chain entry (the dispatch needs to know
it is in the chain case, with a valid length-`d` chain and the base
framework on `G₁`). Could land *before* CHAIN if 5.4 is the bottleneck, or
*concurrently* if 4.6/4.8 are subsumed and 5.4 is narrative-only — see OD.

**Reuse/replace/add map:**
- *Check Phase-20 status:* Lemma 4.6 / Lemma 4.8 — no explicit blueprint
  node found at recon time; may be subsumed in `minimal_kdof_reduction`
  (`Molecular/Induction/`). The detailed recon must `lean_local_search`
  these before scoping. (OD-3.)
- *Add (if load-bearing):* Lemma 5.4 cycle base — its own leaf/sub-phase
  (risk #4; the project decided 2026-06-03 to *formalize, not cite* it as
  genuine panel content).

### ASSEMBLY — Assembly: Theorem 5.5 (general `d`) → Theorem 5.6 → Conjecture 1.2

**Scope.** With `CARRIER`–`ENTRY` green, compose: complete `theorem_55` at general `d`
(the Case-III arm now discharged by the CHAIN chain dispatch + ENTRY entry),
re-green `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` + its `hub` at general grade, derive
**Theorem 5.6** (KT §5.2: strip `G` to a minimal `k`-dof spanning subgraph,
realize via Thm 5.5, re-add the deleted edges — the rank only grows, using
projective invariance to arrange `Π(u)∩Π(v) ≠ ∅`), and **state Conjecture
1.2 as a theorem** (the panel-hinge ⇔ body-hinge realizability equivalence,
which combined with Phase 16's Prop 1.1 is the conjecture). The `d=3`
versions of the Thm 5.5→5.6 push (`rankHypothesis_of_theorem_55_d3`,
`theorem_55_6_d3`) are the templates — mostly carrier-lift + dropping the
`hn : bodyBarDim n = screwDim 2` specialization.

**Hard core.** Mostly composition once `CARRIER`–`ENTRY` land; the genuine content is
the general-`d` `hub` partition brick of `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` (a
Phase-19-partition obligation, **Track-independent**, already noted
multi-commit in the `d=3` case) and the projective-invariance step of
Thm 5.6 at general `d` (the `d=3` re-add was "projective-move-free" because
two distinct hyperplanes through the origin always meet — confirm that holds
at general `d`; KT §5.2 uses projective invariance [4, §3.6] explicitly).

**Dependency position.** Last; gates Cor 5.7 (Phase 26). Phases 24–25 (the
`d=3` bar-joint matroid, projective duality) can proceed in parallel — they
don't gate on the rank theorem until Cor 5.7.

**Reuse/replace/add map:**
- *Reuse / lift:* `rankHypothesis_of_theorem_55_d3` (`Theorem55.lean:2312`),
  `theorem_55_6_d3`, the strip `exists_isMinimalKDof_spanning_subgraph`, the
  re-aim `reaimSub`, the monotonicity `finrank_infinitesimalMotions_le_of_graph_le`.
- *Add:* the general-`d` `hub` partition; the Conjecture 1.2 statement node;
  the general-`d` projective-invariance arrangement (if not free).

---

## 3. Recommended sequence — and why 23a is first

**Sequence: 23a → {CHAIN, ENTRY interleaved} → ASSEMBLY.** ENTRY may lead CHAIN if
Lemma 5.4 turns out to be the long pole; CHAIN may split on contact.

**Why 23a (the carrier lift) is first, not CHAIN (the chain argument):**
1. *Everything downstream is stated over the carrier.* The chain dispatch
   (CHAIN) concludes `HasGenericFullRankRealization k n G` and consumes
   `screwDim k` rank bounds; the `⋀^{d−1}` duality is stated over
   `Fin (k+2) → ℝ`. Both must be *written* at general grade, which is only
   coherent once the spine they plug into is general grade. Building CHAIN
   first would force every new lemma to carry a private `screwDim 2`→`k`
   bridge, exactly the friction the carrier lift removes once.
2. *It is the largest mechanical surface and the one most likely to surface
   a blocking transport.* ScrewSpaceCarrier §6 explicitly flags the
   symbolic-`k` `screwBasis`/`annihRow` transport as unconfirmed at general
   grade (the d=3 probe found it defeq-free only at `k=2`). Doing 23a first
   surfaces any such blocker before the hard *new* mathematics of CHAIN is
   built on top — the project's design-pass-first discipline (don't grind
   research-shaped work over an unverified foundation).
3. *It is the natural home for the deferred carrier "part 2."* 22l deferred
   the general-`d` API migration to this boundary precisely so it lands
   against the now-known general-`d` usage; 23a is that landing.

**FIRST sub-phase = 23a.** The next dispatch is the **23a detailed,
leaf-level recon** (read the spine files end-to-end, enumerate the
`screwDim 2`/`Fin 4`/`ScrewSpace 2` reach-ins along the import spine, run
the ScrewSpaceCarrier §6 opacity-probe-style per-layer readiness check at
symbolic `k`, and cut 23a into buildable leaves). Not a build.

---

## 4. Open decisions (clause-(ii) flags — honest unknowns this recon could
not settle from the source)

- **OD-1. Is Lemma 5.4 (short-cycle base) genuinely on the Lean-load-bearing
  path at general `d`?** KT p. 692 invokes it explicitly: *"If `G` is a
  cycle of length at most `d`, then we are done by Lemma 5.4."* So at
  general `d` the short-cycle base is a **real branch of the Case-III case
  split** — unlike `d=3`, where Case III's `|V|=3` floor was the triangle
  handled inline (the `d=3` assembly dodged 5.4, §1.33(B.1)). *Unsettled:*
  whether the general-`d` formalization can likewise dodge it (e.g. if the
  chain dichotomy can be arranged so the cycle branch is vacuous or folded
  into the base case) or must formalize 5.4 as KT does. If load-bearing,
  5.4 is its own leaf/sub-phase (risk #4: genuine panel content, the
  Crapo–Whiteley cycle realization). **Present as an open branch; do not
  pre-commit a cut that assumes 5.4 is free.**

- **OD-2. Does the general-`d` chain entry (Lemma 4.6 dichotomy) reduce to
  Phase-20 machinery, or is it a new combinatorial prerequisite?** KT's
  4.6 says a 2-edge-connected minimal-0-dof graph with no proper rigid
  subgraph either is a short cycle or has a length-`d` chain. The `d=3`
  assembly entered Case III with a degree-2 vertex `v` and its two
  neighbours `a,b` (the `splitOff v a b` shape) — it never needed the full
  4.6 dichotomy because the 3-candidate dispatch only needed *one* degree-2
  vertex plus its `a`-neighbour's `c`. The general chain needs the *whole*
  length-`d` chain `v₀…v_d`. *Unsettled:* whether `minimal_kdof_reduction`
  (Phase 20) already produces a chain of the needed length, or only the
  single degree-2 split. **The detailed recon must check this in tree
  before scoping ENTRY.**

- **OD-3. Do Lemmas 4.6 / 4.8 already exist (subsumed) in the green
  Phase-20 `minimal_kdof_reduction`, or are they new nodes?** §1.33(C)
  flagged "no explicit node found; may be subsumed." The recon could not
  confirm from prose alone. If subsumed, ENTRY shrinks to "Lemma 5.4 (modulo
  OD-1)"; if not, 4.6/4.8 are new combinatorial leaves. **`lean_local_search`
  for the chain dichotomy / split-off-minimality lemmas is the first
  detailed-recon task for ENTRY.**

- **OD-4. Does the general-`d` N3a (the `d+1` points in general position,
  eq. 6.67) take the existence/Zariski route like the `d=3` N3a, or does it
  force the algebraic-independence hammer?** KT p. 698 states it via alg-
  independence: *"the set of the coefficients … is algebraically independent
  over the rational field. Therefore, for any `j` hyperplanes among them,
  their intersection forms a `(d−j)`-dimensional affine space."* The `d=3`
  N3a was **AVOIDED** (existence route — exhibit one explicit seed where the
  4 points are affinely independent; AlgebraicIndependence.md row #106),
  because at `d=3` the construction is explicit (triple-intersection +
  cross-products). *Unsettled at general `d`:* whether an explicit `d+1`-
  point construction exists (giving the existence route again) or the
  symbolic `j`-hyperplanes-meet-in-`(d−j)`-flat genericity genuinely needs
  alg-independence. The seed-rank kernel (`case_III_nested_rank_lower`)
  **already** consumes `AlgebraicIndependent ℚ q` at `d=3`, so the
  alg-independence machinery is live regardless — but the *N3a points* step
  may or may not be a *new* alg-independence site. **A general-`d` row is
  added to `AlgebraicIndependence.md` either way (the standing instruction);
  the relaxation question (§2 risk (c): does the touched-subgraph family
  grow with `d`?) is exactly this OD.**

- **OD-5. Does the general-`d` carrier lift force a motive/carrier change?**
  ScrewSpaceCarrier §6's whole concern was that freezing the opaque API
  against `d=3`-only usage risks a Phase-23 reshape. *Unsettled:* whether
  the symbolic-`k` `screwBasis`/`annihRow` transport (hard-part (d), proven
  defeq-free only at `k=2`) ports verbatim or needs an API addition. **The
  23a detailed recon's opacity-readiness probe at symbolic `k` settles
  this** — and it is the load-bearing reason 23a is first.

- **OD-6. Does CHAIN split (chain bookkeeping vs duality) on contact?** The
  two hard cores (eqs. 6.59–6.64 chain bookkeeping; the `⋀^{d−1}` duality
  finish, eq. 6.67) are largely independent. Whether they are two leaves of
  one sub-phase or warrant a split is a contact decision for the CHAIN open,
  not settleable now.

## 23a — detailed leaf-level recon

**Status:** detailed-recon done (docs only, 2026-06-17, source-verified +
LSP-probed against the landed tree). Decomposes 23a (§2) into buildable
leaves with exact target signatures, settles **OD-5**, and resolves the
cheap **OD-2/OD-3** in passing. The general-recon §1–§5 above is the parent;
this section is the leaf plan `notes/Phase23a.md` hands off to.

### (a) Per-file reach-in enumeration along the import spine

Spine order (`ScrewSpaceCarrier-design.md` §5): RigidityMatrix/{Basic,
Bricks,Claim612} → PanelLayer → Pinning → PanelHinge → GenericityDevice →
Coupling → CaseI → CaseII → CaseIII/{Arms,Candidate,Relabel,Realization} →
Theorem55. The **central source-verified correction to §1**: the carrier
*infrastructure* and most *bricks* are already general-`k`; the `screwDim 2`/
`Fin 4`/`…2` pins are **numeral specializations at call sites**, not
definitional pins. The lift is therefore mechanical numeral-replacement
(`2`→`k`, `Fin 4`→`Fin (k+2)`, `screwDim 2`→`screwDim k`, `…Realization 2`→
`… k`) **plus** a small symbolic-arithmetic kit and a `Fin 4` panel-geometry
lift — *not* a structure redefinition.

Per-file, dependency-ordered (this ordering IS the leaf sequence):

| File | Pin reach-ins | Lift status for 23a |
|---|---|---|
| **RigidityMatrix/Basic** | `screwDim`=`(k+2).choose 2` (general); `ScrewSpace`/`mk`/`val`/`equivExteriorPower`/3 instances all `(k:ℕ)`; `screwSpace_finrank` uses `change`+`exteriorPower.finrank_eq` (general, no `decide`). 1×`screwDim 2`/`ScrewSpace 2` in a doc-comment only. | **already general.** Add only the `screwDim k` arithmetic kit (below). |
| **RigidityMatrix/Bricks** | none | none |
| **RigidityMatrix/Claim612** | 68×`Fin 4`, 15×`ScrewSpace 2`. **Two families:** (i) general-`k` `{k:ℕ}` algebra (`eq_zero_of_annihilates_span_top`, `mem_hingeRowBlock_iff`, `linearIndependent_sum*_candidateRow*`, `candidateRow_ne_zero`, …) — done; (ii) **`Fin 4` panel-geometry/duality** (`span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top`, `omitTwoExtensor_*`, `exists_independent_perp_pair`, `exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals`, `exists_*complementIso*`, `exists_hduality_witness*`). | family (ii) splits: the **incidence/extensor** lemmas feeding the spine lift in 23a; the **`⋀²ℝ⁴` duality** lemmas (`exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals`, `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence`, `exists_hduality_witness*`) are **consumed only inside `case_III_candidate_dispatch`** → CHAIN. |
| **PanelLayer** | 46×`Fin 4` vs **174×`Fin (k+2)`** — mostly general. `Fin 4` cluster is the `d=3` **panel-incidence geometry** (≈ll.357–838): `exists_two_perp_of_linearIndependent_normals`, `exists_three_perp`, `exists_linearIndependent_extensor_pair_perp`, `exists_extensor_eq_panelSupportExtensor`, `exists_extensor_in_two_panels`. The `fin_cases`/`decide` (33) are all in this band. | **`screwBasis`/`annihRow`/`annihRowPoly`/`panelSupportExtensor`/`panelSupportPoly`/`triLI_subpairs`/`exists_triangle_normals` are ALL already `(k:ℕ)`** (ll.232,960,1091,1164,1252,1271,1408). Lift only the `Fin 4` incidence band (the dimension count `finrank ℝ (Fin 4→ℝ)=4` → `=k+2`). |
| **Pinning** | 0 `Fin 4`/`screwDim 2`; 1 `fin_cases` (general). | none (general). |
| **PanelHinge** | 0. `PanelHingeFramework (k:ℕ)`, `HasGenericFullRankRealization (k n:ℕ)`, `HasPanelRealization (k n:ℕ)`, `ofNormals (q:α×Fin (k+2)→ℝ)`, `IsGeneralPosition` all parametric. | none (general — and opacity-neutral, L3 probe). |
| **GenericityDevice** | 0 `Fin 4`/`screwDim 2`; the 4×`…Realization 2` are in the forgetful map `hasPanelRealization_of_generic`. The 5× `change … (Pi.single a (screwBasis k t))` blocks (hard-part (d)) are **already `screwBasis k`**; `exists_good_realization_ofParam` is the device proof, stated `screwDim k * card α`. | none for the device; the forgetful-map `2`-pins lift with the `HasGenericFullRankRealization` numeral pass. |
| **Coupling** | **0 `screwDim 2`/`Fin 4`/`…2`** — fully general (`extProj`, `degeneratePlacement (nrm:α→Fin (k+2)→ℝ)`, all coupling producers `ScrewSpace k`). | **none.** |
| **CaseI** | **0 `screwDim 2`/`Fin 4`/`…2`** — fully general (`case_I_realization {n k:ℕ}` is dof-`k`; dimension general). | **none.** |
| **CaseII** | 26×`screwDim 2`, 8×`ScrewSpace 2`, 4×`…Realization 2`. All in `case_II_realization_all_k`'s **rank arithmetic** (`screwDim 2 * (|V|-1) - (k-1)`, the eq.-(6.12) ℤ/ℕ-cast plumbing) + the conclusion numeral. No `decide`/`fin_cases`. | lift: numeral pass + the `screwDim k` arithmetic kit (the cast plumbing is `toNat_le_of_add_pred_eq`-style, already `{D V N:ℕ}`-parametric in Basic). |
| **CaseIII/{Arms,Candidate,Relabel}** | Arms: 8×`…Realization 2` (incl. `case_III_hsplit_producer`, which calls `hasGenericFullRankRealization_of_triangle (k:=2)` — the triangle brick is **already `(k)`-parametric**) + 8 `fin_cases`/`decide` in the M2/M3-arm geometry. Candidate: 0 literal pins, but the Claim-6.11 family is `ScrewSpace k`/`Fin (k+2)` (general); `caseIIICandidate`/`case_III_old_new_blocks`/`case_III_rank_certification` consume the `q : α × Fin 4` dispatch shape. Relabel: 0 pins (general `ofNormals_relabel` machinery). | numeral pass on Arms' `…Realization 2`; the M2/M3 geometry + `caseIIICandidate` chain bookkeeping is **CHAIN** (it is the dispatch internals). 23a stops at the producer *skeleton* `case_III_hsplit_producer` shape, leaving `hcand` explicit. |
| **CaseIII/Realization** | 13×`Fin 4`, 12×`screwDim 2`, 11×`…Realization 2`, 7×`fin_cases`/`decide`. **`case_III_candidate_dispatch` (181–517)** is the structurally-fixed-3-candidate body (`q:α×Fin 4`, fixed `v,a,b,c`, the `linearIndependent_normals_of_algebraicIndependent` (l.99, `Fin 4`-pinned) + `exists_homogeneousIncidence`+`exists_complementIso` `⋀²ℝ⁴` discriminator at ll.351–353) → **CHAIN replace.** `case_III_nested_rank_lower` (561), `case_III_realization_0dof` (518), `case_III_realization` (665) are `screwDim 2`/`q:α×Fin 4`-pinned **spine** decls. | lift `_nested_rank_lower`/`_realization`/`_0dof` (numeral + arithmetic kit); their proofs compose general bricks **except** the `case_III_candidate_dispatch` call → that call becomes the green-modulo `hcand` hypothesis (boundary (d) below). |
| **Theorem55** | 27×`Fin 4`, 73×`screwDim 2`, 40×`…Realization 2`, 21×`…Framework 2`, 6 `decide`. `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k` (2176) is the dof-`k` induction spine, **dimension-pinned at `screwDim 2`** via `hn`; its callback map wires base/cut/CaseI/CaseII/CaseIII bricks at `(k:=2)`. The `theorem_55_d3`/`_all_k` wrappers discharge `hD`/`hn` by `decide`. The cut/coupling helpers carry the assembly `q:α×Fin 4` / `Pi.single 0 1 : Fin 4→ℝ` / `Set.powersetCard (Fin 4) 2`. | the **largest numeral surface**; lift `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k` to `HasGenericFullRankRealization k`, restate `hn:bodyBarDim n = screwDim k` + an `hD` floor giving `screwDim k ≥ 2` (see kit), thread the green-modulo `hcand` up. `rankHypothesis_of_theorem_55_d3` / Thm-5.6 push is **ASSEMBLY** (not 23a). |

`linearIndependent_normals_of_algebraicIndependent` (Realization l.99,
`Fin 4`-pinned) is consumed **both** inside the dispatch (CHAIN) **and** by
`Theorem55.lean:565/678` (cut/base spine) and `Pinning` — so it is a **shared
brick 23a must lift** to `Fin (k+2)` (it is the "any `k`+1 distinct-body
normals are LI from alg-indep" fact; generalizes by the same Vandermonde/
projection argument, no `d=3` content).

### (b) OD-5 verdict — **PORTS VERBATIM. No carrier-API addition; no spike.**

The coordinate transport (hard-part (d): `screwBasis`/`annihRow`) **is already
written at symbolic `k` in the landed tree and already compiles.** Three
source facts, each verified, settle it:

1. **`screwBasis (k:ℕ)`** (PanelLayer:1252)
   `= (Pi.basisFun ℝ (Fin (k+2))).exteriorPower k |>.map (equivExteriorPower k).symm`;
   **`screwBasis_repr_apply := rfl`** at general `k` (1261); the whole
   `annihRow`/`_apply`/`_self`/`_add`/`_smul`/`span_annihRow_eq_dualAnnihilator`/
   `annihRowPoly`/`_eval` family (1271–1419+) is `(k:ℕ)`, proved through
   **abstract `Module.Basis` API** (`repr_self_apply`, `coord_apply`,
   `Basis.ext`, `sum_repr`) — zero `k=2`-concreteness, zero `decide`/`fin_cases`.
2. **`GenericityDevice.exists_good_realization_ofParam`** — the device proof
   exercising the dual-basis coordinate machinery — is stated
   `screwDim k * Fintype.card α` over `Set.powersetCard (Fin (k+2)) k` /
   `Pi.basis (fun _ => screwBasis k)`, with the 5× hard-part-(d)
   `change … (Pi.single a (screwBasis k t)) = …` blocks **already symbolic**
   and green in HEAD.
3. **Carrier API + instances** are `(k:ℕ)` with `inferInstanceAs`
   (ScrewSpaceCarrier §5 OQ4 confirmed instances resolve symbolically);
   `equivExteriorPower` is the `cast (ScrewSpace_def k)` form, `k`-parametric.

So ScrewSpaceCarrier §6's worry — "hard-part (d) gets exercised symbolically
*for the first time* in Phase 23" — is **already false in the landed source**:
the coordinate layer was authored general from the start and the `d=3` usage
only ever specialized the *numerals around it*, never the transport. **OD-5
resolves to "ports verbatim"; 23a needs no carrier-API addition and no
build-spike.** *Residual flag:* the LSP can't prove a clean cap stays at
default under the full general-`k` numeral substitution end-to-end (the same
class of unconfirmable as ScrewSpaceCarrier OQ1) — but that is a perf
observation, not a correctness blocker, and every cap is already at default
(0 overrides). If a lifted file regresses a cap, raise it locally (the
standing idiom), do not treat it as an OD-5 reopening.

**The genuinely-new symbolic surface 23a DOES introduce** is *not* the
coordinate machinery but the **`screwDim k` numeric arithmetic**: at `k=2`
the spine discharges `2 ≤ screwDim 2`, `screwDim 2 - 2 ≤ screwDim 2·(m-1)`,
`screwDim 2 = 6` by `decide`; at symbolic `k` these become `screwDim k`
obligations. **LSP-probed (2026-06-17):** `omega` does **not** close
`2 ≤ screwDim k` after `unfold screwDim` (the `choose 2 = n(n-1)/2` integer
division defeats it), and **`2 ≤ screwDim k` is FALSE at `k=0`**
(`screwDim 0 = (2).choose 2 = 1`); it holds only from the dimension floor
`k ≥ 1` (`screwDim 1 = 3`). `1 ≤ screwDim k` *does* close
(`Nat.one_le_iff_ne_zero.mpr (by simp [screwDim, Nat.choose_eq_zero_iff])`).
⟹ **23a's Leaf 0 is a tiny `screwDim`-arithmetic kit** (below), and the
spine's `hn`/`hD` hypotheses must thread a `k ≥ 1` floor (the body-bar regime
`d = k+1 ≥ 2`) so the `≥ 2` facts are derivable, not `decide`d.

### (c) Buildable-leaf sequence for 23a

Smallest-buildable commits, dependency-ordered. Each re-greens its file(s)
on the still-green tree (the lift is additive/restating, not deleting).

- **Leaf 0 — `screwDim` arithmetic kit** (`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`). **DONE
  (c2669b3).** Added `one_le_screwDim {k} : 1 ≤ screwDim k`,
  `two_le_screwDim {k} (hk : 1 ≤ k) : 2 ≤ screwDim k` (the floor-conditioned
  `≥2`), and `screwDim_sub_two_le_mul {k m} (hm : 2 ≤ m) : screwDim k - 2 ≤ screwDim k * (m-1)`
  (the `_nested_rank_lower` l.641/643 `decide` replacements). Tiny `Nat.choose`
  lemmas; no carrier content. Touches Basic only; no consumers yet, so
  trivially green. **Two corrections to this recon spec at build:**
  `screwDim_sub_two_le_mul` takes **`2 ≤ m`**, not the `1 ≤ m` originally
  written — the latter is *provably false* at `m = 1` (RHS `= D·0 = 0 < D−2`
  for `k ≥ 1`); the call site (`case_III_nested_rank_lower`) has `2 ≤ |V'|` in
  scope. And its `(hk)` is unused (`D−2 ≤ D = D·1 ≤ D·(m−1)` needs nothing
  about `k`), so dropped.
- **Leaf 1 — `Fin 4` panel-incidence geometry → `Fin (k+2)`** (`PanelLayer.lean`,
  ll.357–838 band). **Split at build into two commits** (see corrections below):
  - **Leaf 1a (DONE)** — the duality-free rank-nullity core. Landed the general
    brick `exists_linearIndependent_perp_of_normals {r m} (N : Fin r → Fin (k+2)
    → ℝ) (hmr : m + r ≤ k + 2)` (`m` LI vectors in `⋂ⱼ Nⱼ^⊥`, `mulVecLin` kernel
    + `finrank_range_add_finrank_ker`, `Module.finrank_pi`+`Fintype.card_fin` at
    `k+2`); `exists_two_perp_of_linearIndependent_normals` (`r=2,m=2`),
    `exists_three_perp` (`r=1,m=3`), and `exists_extensor_in_two_panels`
    (`r=2,m=2`) now reduce to it (triplicated rank-nullity proof deleted).
  - **Leaf 1b (next)** — the grade-`k` extensor remainder: lift
    `exists_linearIndependent_extensor_pair_perp` and
    `exists_extensor_in_two_panels` to produce `ScrewSpace k` extensors of
    `Fin k`/`Fin (k+1)`-tuples (the `Fin k`-arity geometry, off
    `exists_linearIndependent_perp_of_normals`), with `k=2` wrappers keeping
    `theorem_55_base`/cut-edge green. Detail: `notes/Phase23a.md` *Hand-off*.
  - **DROPPED to CHAIN:** `exists_extensor_eq_panelSupportExtensor` (+ its
    corollary `extensorInPanel_panelSupportExtensor`, helper
    `panelSupportExtensor_join_eq_zero_of_eq_zero`) — routes through `Meet.lean`'s
    `extensor_join_eq_zero_of_complementIso_eq_zero_dotProduct` →
    `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join`, the `⋀²ℝ⁴` point-join↔panel-meet
    duality this recon assigns to CHAIN. Lifts only *with* the `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})`
    duality finish.
  - **23a-OD-A — RESOLVED, recommendation was WRONG.** `ExtensorInPanel C n`
    (`Basic.lean:276`) needs `C.val = extensor p` with `p : Fin k → Fin (k+2) →
    ℝ`; the perp arity is the **extensor grade `k`**, not the codim-2 hinge. So
    the extensor-bearing bricks need `Fin k`/`Fin (k+1)` tuples at general `k`
    (Leaf 1b), *not* the ambient-only `Fin 2` the recommendation claimed.
- **Leaf 2 — `Fin 4` incidence/extensor bricks in Claim612 + the shared LI
  brick** (`RigidityMatrix/Claim612.lean`, `CaseIII/Realization.lean` l.99).
  Lift `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top`, `omitTwoExtensor_eq_extensor_kept`,
  `omitTwoExtensor_homogenize_eq_extensor_kept`, `exists_independent_perp_pair`
  (the incidence bricks the spine — not the dispatch duality — consumes) and
  `linearIndependent_normals_of_algebraicIndependent` (Realization l.99) to
  `Fin (k+2)`. **Leave the `⋀²ℝ⁴`-duality lemmas
  (`exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals`,
  `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence`,
  `exists_hduality_witness_of_panel_incidence`) at `Fin 4` — they are
  dispatch-only (CHAIN).** Re-green Claim612 (the general-`k` family is
  untouched). **23a-OD-B:** `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` is stated
  `{pbar : Fin 4 → Fin 4 → ℝ}` (a *square* `(k+2)×(k+2)` system) — confirm its
  proof generalizes (it should: it is `omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent_of_li {e:ℕ}`
  applied + a `span = top` dimension count, both already general).
- **Leaf 3 — CaseII rank-arithmetic numeral pass** (`CaseII.lean`). Restate
  `case_II_realization_all_k` and its lemmas at `screwDim k` /
  `HasGenericFullRankRealization k`, routing the eq.-(6.12) ℤ/ℕ cast plumbing
  through the (already `{D V N:ℕ}`-parametric) Basic helpers and the Leaf-0
  kit for the `≥2` facts. Re-green CaseII.
- **Leaf 4 — Case-III spine lift with the dispatch left explicit**
  (`CaseIII/Realization.lean` + `CaseIII/Arms.lean`). Restate
  `case_III_nested_rank_lower`, `case_III_realization_0dof`,
  `case_III_realization` at `screwDim k`/`Fin (k+2)`/`… k`; their proofs
  compose general bricks + the Leaf-0 kit, **except** the
  `case_III_candidate_dispatch` call. **Re-state `case_III_realization` (and
  `case_III_hsplit_producer`'s `hcand` slot) to take the chain dispatch as an
  explicit hypothesis** `hcand`/`hdispatch` of the general-`k` shape (boundary
  (d)). Re-green CaseIII.
- **Leaf 5 — Theorem55 spine lift, dispatch threaded up** (`Theorem55.lean`).
  Restate `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k` to `HasGenericFullRankRealization k`
  with `hn : bodyBarDim n = screwDim k` + the `k≥1`/`hD`-floor, lift its
  base/cut/CaseI/CaseII/CaseIII callback wiring numeral-wise, and **thread the
  green-modulo `hcand` hypothesis** through to `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k`'s
  own signature (its callers CHAIN discharges). Keep a `theorem_55_d3` wrapper
  that specializes `k:=2` and discharges the dispatch via the *existing*
  `case_III_candidate_dispatch` (so the `d=3` line stays fully green through
  23a — no regression). Re-green Theorem55. **This leaf closes 23a.**

Carrier-API additions preceding consumers: **none** (OD-5 verbatim). The only
"add" is Leaf-0's three `screwDim` arithmetic lemmas — not carrier API, pure
`Nat.choose`.

### (d) Green-modulo boundary 23a leaves for CHAIN

`case_III_realization` (and through it `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k`) **cannot be
closed at general `k` until CHAIN supplies the chain dispatch**, because the body
calls `case_III_candidate_dispatch` (the fixed-3-candidate `d=3` argument).
23a's boundary: lift `case_III_realization` / `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k` to
carry the dispatch as an **explicit `hcand`/`hdispatch` hypothesis** of the
general-`k` `case_III_hsplit_producer.hcand` shape — i.e. *"given the chain
data + a fresh `e₀` + the IH-generic `v`-split realization at dimension `k`,
produce `HasGenericFullRankRealization k n G`."* (The standing explicit-`h…`
crux idiom; never a `sorry`.) The **`d=3` line stays fully green** because the
`theorem_55_d3` wrapper specializes `k:=2` and fills `hcand` from the existing
`case_III_candidate_dispatch`. CHAIN replaces the fixed-3-candidate dispatch with
the length-`d` chain dispatch + `⋀^{d-1}(ℝ^{d+1})` duality, discharging the
hypothesis at general `k`.

**Boundary as actually built (23a Leaf 5 — wider than this (d) anticipated).**
The dispatch is only one of **six** green-modulo carries `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k_all_k`
takes; the others (base/cut/Case-I/M4-forget producers `d=3`-pinned → CHAIN's
duality; the `6 ≤ bodyBarDim n` chain-extraction floor → ENTRY) are recorded in
the **Scope expansion** note under §"CHAIN" above and in `notes/Phase23a.md`
*Hand-off*. (a)'s per-file claims that base/cut/Case-I and the forgetful map
"lift with the numeral pass" are **superseded** by that finding.

### (e) 23a-specific open decisions

- **23a-OD-A (Leaf 1 point-arity) — RESOLVED at the Leaf-1a build: the
  point-arity IS `d`-dependent; the "ambient-only" recommendation was wrong.**
  `ExtensorInPanel C n` (`Basic.lean:276`) requires `C.val = extensor p` with
  `p : Fin k → Fin (k+2) → ℝ` — the perp tuple's length is the **extensor grade
  `k`**, not the codim-2 hinge. So the extensor-bearing bricks
  (`exists_linearIndependent_extensor_pair_perp`, `exists_extensor_in_two_panels`)
  need `Fin k`/`Fin (k+1)` perp tuples at general `k` (Leaf 1b). The *ambient*
  `Fin 4 → Fin (k+2)` lift and the rank-nullity count are arity-clean (the
  general brick `exists_linearIndependent_perp_of_normals` carries them); only
  the extensor construction is `k`-arity.
- **23a-OD-B (`span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` squareness).** Its `Fin 4×Fin 4`
  system generalizes to `(k+2)×(k+2)` via the already-general
  `omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent_of_li {e:ℕ}` + a `span=top` count.
  Confirm the dimension count ports; expected clean.
- **23a-OD-C (cap regressions under symbolic `k`).** OD-5 is verbatim for
  *correctness*; the LSP cannot confirm the 0-override perf state survives the
  full numeral substitution. *Recommendation:* treat any regressed cap as a
  local `maxHeartbeats` bump at that decl (standing idiom), not an OD-5
  reopening. Not a blocker.

### OD-2 / OD-3 resolution (secondary; for ENTRY scoping)

In tree under `Molecular/Induction/`:
- **KT Lemma 4.6** (chain-or-cycle / degree-2 vertex): `exists_low_degree_vertex`
  + `exists_adjacent_degree_two_pair` (`ReducibleVertex.lean:620/814`, cited
  "KT Lemma 4.6 at `d=3`") and `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`
  (`ForestSurgery/Reduction.lean:383`).
- **KT Lemma 4.8** (split-off minimality): `splitOff_removeVertex_minimalKDof`
  (`Reduction.lean:1492`) + `lem:reduction-step-pos` (1736), cited "KT Lemma
  4.8(i)/(ii)".

**Verdict (OD-3):** 4.6/4.8 **exist, but only in their fixed-tuple `d=3`
form** — `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` produces a **fixed `v,a,b,c` 4-tuple**
(`exists_adjacent_degree_two_pair` + two `exists_splitOff_data_of_degree_eq_two`),
**not** a length-`d` chain `v₀…v_d`. So the general-`d` chain producer is a
**new combinatorial leaf for ENTRY**, *not* subsumed; OD-2's "does Phase-20
produce a length-`d` chain?" answer is **no — only the single degree-2 split**.
**Verdict (OD-1, corroborating):** no dedicated Lemma 5.4 short-cycle decl
exists; the `d=3` Case III handles its `|V|=3` floor via the triangle base
`hasGenericFullRankRealization_of_triangle` (Arms.lean), confirming the `d=3`
assembly **dodged 5.4** — whether the general-`d` formalization can likewise
dodge it stays open for ENTRY.

## CHAIN — detailed leaf-level recon

**Status:** detailed-recon done (docs only, 2026-06-17, source-verified +
KT §6.4.2 read end-to-end against the landed tree; the minted letter is
**23b**, work log `notes/Phase23b.md`). Decomposes the CHAIN layer (§2) into
buildable leaves with exact target signatures, decides **OD-6**, settles/flags
**OD-4**, and scopes the lift of the four 23a-carried producers + the
`hdispatch` carry. The general-recon §1–§5 and the §"CHAIN" scope note are the
parent; this section is the leaf plan `notes/Phase23b.md` hands off to.

**KT §6.4.2 read (verified 2026-06-17, PDF pp. 692–698 = pdf pages 45–51,
offset −647).** The general-`d` argument, eqs. (6.46)–(6.67): a chain
`v₀v₁…v_d` with `d_G(vᵢ)=2` for `1≤i≤d−1`; one base framework `(G₁,q₁)` on the
split-off `G₁ = G^{v₀v₂}_{v₁}` with `R(G₁,q₁)=D(|V|−2)` (6.46); `d` candidate
frameworks `(G,p₀),…,(G,p_{d−1})` (6.47/6.48/6.57/6.59) built from `(G₁,q₁)`
and the isos `ρᵢ` (6.54)/(6.56); each `R(G,pᵢ)` reduced by column+row ops to a
top-left `D×D` block `Mᵢ` plus `R(G₁∖(v₀v₂)_{i*}, q₁)` (6.50/6.53/6.64), using
the **always-existing redundant `(v₀v₂)_{i*}` row from Claim 6.11** (6.51/6.52);
the ±r chain `∑ⱼλ rⱼ(q(vᵢvᵢ₊₁)) = ±r` for `2≤i≤d−1` (6.66, "in a manner
similar to (6.44)", the degree-2 fact); whence `Mᵢ` fails full rank iff
`r ⊥ C(Lᵢ)`. The eq. (6.67) finish: take `d+1` points `p₀…p_d` with `pᵢ ∈
⋂_{j≠i}Πⱼ ∖ Πᵢ` and `p_d = ⋂ⱼΠⱼ`; they are affinely independent, every
`(d−1)`-subset's `(d−2)`-flat lies in `⋃ⱼΠⱼ`, so the `(d−1)`-extensors of
`(d−1)`-subsets span a `(d+1 choose d−1) = D`-dim space by **Lemma 2.1**,
forcing some `Mᵢ` to have full rank, i.e. `rank R(G,pᵢ) = D + D(|V|−2) =
D(|V|−1)`. KT, p. 692: *"The proof strategy is exactly the same as `d = 3`."*

### (a) Per-file reach-in enumeration along the CHAIN surface

The carrier + arm-realization layer **is already general-`k`** (23a lifted the
spine; the M₁/M₂/M₃ arm closers were authored `(k:ℕ)` from Phase 22h). The
`Fin 4`/`⋀²ℝ⁴`/`screwDim 2`/`Fin 3`-pins that remain are concentrated in **the
dispatch and its `⋀²ℝ⁴` discriminator** — exactly the surface §1/§"CHAIN"
isolate as the new argument. Source-verified per-decl:

| Decl | File:line | Grade as landed | CHAIN action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `case_III_candidate_dispatch` | `CaseIII/Realization.lean:201` | `q : α × Fin 4 → ℝ`, fixed `v,a,b,c`, `na/nb/nc`, `ScrewSpace 2`, `screwDim 2`, `Fin 3` dispatch (`fin_cases u`), `h622lb` over `Fin 4` — **`d=3`-pinned AND structurally fixed-3-candidate** | **REPLACE** by the `d`-chain dispatch (eqs. 6.46–6.67) |

Full leaf §(j) CHAIN-4d |
| `exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence` | `Claim612.lean:522` | `Fin 4` joins, `omitTwoExtensor pbar`, `exists_independent_perp_pair`, `omitTwoExtensor_eq_extensor_kept` | re-state at `Fin (d+1)`; routes through the duality leaves below |
| `case_III_claim612` | `Claim612.lean` | `Fin 4`/`ScrewSpace 2`, the six-join existential via `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` (general `k`, landed Leaf 2) + the join↔meet duality | re-state at `ScrewSpace (d−1)`/`Fin (d+1)`; **N1 brick `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` already general** |
| `omitTwoExtensor_eq_extensor_kept`, `…_homogenize_…`, `exists_independent_perp_pair` | `Claim612.lean:482/283/319` | `Fin 4`-pinned incidence/extensor bricks (dispatch-internal, 23a moved to CHAIN) | re-state at `Fin (d+1)` (mechanical; the `Fin 4`-arity geometry → `Fin (d+1)`) |
| `extensor_mem_range_map_subtype_of_mem`, `exists_smul_eq_of_mem_range_map_subtype` | `Meet.lean:648/676` | `W : Submodule ℝ (Fin 4 → ℝ)`, `⋀[ℝ]^2`, `finrank_exteriorPower_two_eq_one`, `finrank(range)=2.choose 2=1` | **re-state at** `⋀[ℝ]^{d−1}(Fin (d+1)→ℝ)` with `finrank(⋀^{d−1}W)=(dim W choose d−1)` (W of `dim = d−1` ⟹ `=1`); the route is general mathlib, the lemmas re-state at concrete grade |
| `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` | `Meet.lean:1075` | `n_u n' pi pj : Fin 4 → ℝ`, `complementIso(k:=2)(j:=2)`, `Φ̃ = wedgeFixedLeft n_u ⊔ wedgeFixedLeft n'` `dim 5`, `Ω = dualAnnihilator Φ̃` `dim 1`, `extensor ![…]` (2-extensors) | **re-prove** at `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})` via the **`⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line** route (§(f), NOT the `Φ̃` lift): `n_u, n'` stay **2** normals (`complementIso(k:=d−1)(j:=2)`), `pi…` → **`d−1`** points; both members in `range(⋀^{d−1}W ↪)`, a line. `Φ̃`/`Ω`/`finrank_sup_range` route is **dead at `d≥4`** — keep d=3 body as the wrapper |
| `exteriorPower_basis_toDual_eq_pairingDual_comp_map` | `Meet.lean:866` | `(Pi.basisFun ℝ (Fin 4)).exteriorPower n` — `Fin 4`-pinned base | re-state at `Fin (d+1)` (the proof is `Module.Basis.ext` + `pairingDual_ιMulti_ιMulti`, dimension-generic) |
| `exists_extensor_eq_panelSupportExtensor` | `PanelLayer.lean` (23a Leaf-1b DROP) | the `⋀²ℝ⁴` point-join↔panel-meet bridge consumer; **the M4-forget unblocker** | lift **with** the duality finish (the four-producer lift, §"CHAIN"(d)) |
| `case_III_arm_realization`, `_M2`, `_M3` | `Arms.lean:72`, `Relabel.lean` | **ALREADY general `k`** (`q : α × Fin (k+2)`, `ScrewSpace k`, `screwDim k`) — the per-candidate certify-then-rebase + relabel transport | **reuse verbatim** as the per-candidate engine the `d`-chain dispatch feeds |
| `linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow` | `RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean` | **general `k`, graph-free**; augmented by **one** `Unit` candidate | **DONE (CHAIN-1, 2026-06-18):** generalized to the `ιc`-block augment `linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow_block` (+ the abstract `…_pinned_block_augment_block`); this is now the `ιc := Unit` corollary |

**The central structural finding (verified, reshapes the cut): the
arm-realization engine is general-grade; only the DISPATCH (candidate count +
`⋀²ℝ⁴` discriminator) is `d=3`-fixed.** The `d=3` dispatch
(`case_III_candidate_dispatch`) builds the three normals `na,nb,nc`, runs the
`Fin 3`-discriminator (`exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals` →
`exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence`) to pick a discriminating
panel `u : Fin 3` and transversal `n'`, then `fin_cases u` dispatches to the
three (already general-`k`) arm closers W7/W8/W9c. So CHAIN's new content is the
`d`-candidate generalization of *that dispatch shell* + the `⋀^{d−1}` duality
the discriminator rests on — **not** a rewrite of the arm-realization layer.

### (b) The producer-shape mismatch — the load-bearing flag (clause (ii))

**FLAG (motive/producer-level; do NOT force a leaf signature past it).** The
23a-carried `hdispatch` (`Theorem55.lean:2225`, =
`case_III_realization_all_k.hdispatch`, = `case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k.hcand`)
takes a **fixed `v,a,b,c` 4-tuple** with the `d=3` chain shape (`eₐ:va`,
`e_b:vb`, `e_c:ac`, the two degree-2 closures `hclv`/`hcla`). This is the data
`case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k` extracts via `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`
(`Reduction.lean:383`) — which, verified, produces **only a fixed 4-tuple, not a
length-`d` chain** (the OD-2/OD-3 verdict). But KT's general-`d` Lemma 6.13
**needs the whole length-`d` chain `v₀…v_d`** to build the `d` candidates
(6.54/6.56/6.57). At `d=3` the chain `v₀v₁v₂v₃` *is* exactly `c—a—v—b` (the
4-tuple `v,a,b,c` with `v₁=v` deg-2, `v₂=a` deg-2 in `G₁`, `v₀=b`, `v₃=c`
endpoints), so the fixed-4-tuple dispatch *is* the length-3 chain dispatch and
the carried shape is faithful. At `d≥4` it is **not**: the fixed 4-tuple is too
short, and the carried `hdispatch` cannot be discharged from it.

**Consequence.** CHAIN cannot be a pure "discharge the carried `hdispatch` at
general `k`" — the *producer/extractor that supplies `hdispatch`'s premises must
be reshaped* to extract and pass a length-`d` chain. Concretely, three coupled
changes:
1. **the chain extractor** (`exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`) must produce a
   length-`d` chain `v₀…v_d` (a Phase-20-shape combinatorial lemma — KT Lemma
   4.6/4.8; the **ENTRY** layer, OD-2/OD-3 verdict: "new combinatorial leaf");
2. **the producer** (`case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k`) must thread that chain
   into its `hcand` slot (its `hcand`/`hdispatch` shape changes from fixed
   4-tuple to length-`d` chain);
3. **the dispatch** (CHAIN's deliverable) consumes the chain.
This is a genuine **motive/producer-shape change**, not a numeral lift, and it
**couples CHAIN to ENTRY**: the dispatch's input shape is the chain extractor's
output shape. **Recommendation:** CHAIN and ENTRY co-design the chain-data shape
at CHAIN open (the `hdispatch`/`hcand` signature is the contract between them);
23b should not freeze the dispatch signature before the chain-data record is
agreed with ENTRY. The 23a `hdispatch` carry is **correct as the `d=3` instance
contract** (the `k=2` wrapper fills it from `case_III_candidate_dispatch`), and
stays green through 23a/ASSEMBLY-at-`d=3`; it is the *general-`d`* shape that
must grow. This is exactly the "honest open decision the coordinator/user
adjudicates" clause-(ii) calls for — see OD-6 / OD-7 below.

### (c) Buildable-leaf sequence for CHAIN

Smallest-buildable, dependency-ordered. The two hard cores (chain bookkeeping
CHAIN-1/2; duality CHAIN-3/4) are **largely independent** and feed the dispatch
assembly CHAIN-5. Each leaf re-greens its file on the still-green tree (additive
restating; the `Fin 4`/`d=3` decls stay as `d=3` wrappers so the `d=3` line
never regresses). **CHAIN-0/CHAIN-5 are gated by the (b) flag** — the dispatch
signature depends on the ENTRY chain-data contract.

- **CHAIN-1 — the `d`-fold candidate machinery** (`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`).
  **CLOSED 2026-06-18** (Phase23b rows 211–212). Two bricks: (1) the
  row-correspondence swap `linearIndependent_sumElim_candidateBlock_swap` + mirror
  `linearIndependent_sumElim_block_swap` (KT eq. 6.62 — correct an `ιc`-block of
  candidate rows by base-span members); (2) the `ιc`-block candidate augment
  `linearIndependent_sum_pinned_block_augment_block` +
  `linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow_block` (the `+|ιc|` count lift; the
  single-`Unit` `…_augment{,…_candidateRow}` re-derived as `ιc := Unit` corollaries,
  blueprint pins unmoved). Graph-free over `ScrewSpace k`, no `d=3` content. The
  heterogeneous-chain per-candidate column-op (each `i` its own `Φᵢ`) is **CHAIN-2's**
  bookkeeping — the augment fires one body at a time at the chosen split body `v`.
- **CHAIN-2 — the chain matrix bookkeeping (eqs. 6.59–6.64)** (`CaseIII/`, new
  file or extend `Candidate`). The per-candidate-`i` reduction of `R(G,pᵢ)`
  (6.60) to the `Mᵢ ⊕ R(G₁∖(v₀v₂)_{i*},q₁)` form (6.64), via the column op
  (add `vᵢ`-cols to `vᵢ₊₁`-cols), the substitution (6.59), the row
  correspondence (6.62), and the redundant-row weights `λ` (6.52, the Claim
  6.11 redundancy — **reuse `exists_redundant_panelRow_ab_of_finrank_eq`,
  general & GREEN**). The ±r chain (6.66) is the degree-2 fact "in a manner
  similar to (6.44)". *This is the index-heavy generalization of the
  `caseIIICandidate`/`case_III_old_new_blocks`/`case_III_rank_certification`
  chain (now `q : α × Fin 4`-shaped) to a `Fin d`-indexed candidate family.*
  Heaviest mechanical leaf; KT calls it "exactly the same as `d=3`."
- **CHAIN-3 — the `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})` duality bricks** (`Meet.lean` + `MeetHodge.lean`).
  **CLOSED 2026-06-17** — the assembly `extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet`
  (`MeetHodge.lean`) landed on the three `_grade` bricks + the OD-8 route-(α) leaf chain h-0…h-3;
  the `⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line route as recon'd in §(f). The d=3 `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join`
  stays the green d=3 wrapper. Original recon (kept for the CHAIN-4 reach-in reference):
  Re-state `extensor_mem_range_map_subtype_of_mem`,
  `exists_smul_eq_of_mem_range_map_subtype`,
  `exteriorPower_basis_toDual_eq_pairingDual_comp_map`,
  `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` at `⋀[ℝ]^{d−1}(Fin (d+1)→ℝ)` with the
  general `finrank(⋀^{d−1}W) = (finrank W).choose (d−1)`
  (`exteriorPower.finrank_eq`; at `dim W = d−1` this is `1`). The route is
  general mathlib (`exteriorPower.map_injective_field`, `map_apply_ιMulti`,
  `pairingDual_ιMulti_ιMulti`, `topEquiv`/`pairingDualEquiv` mirrors); the
  the proportionality lives in the line `⋀^{d−1}W` (`dim W = d−1`). **Build
  LAZILY at concrete grade `(d−1, d+1)` — do NOT build a general Hodge-star /
  regressive-product API (KT never needs it; §1/§"CHAIN" hard core 2).**
  **CORRECTED by the CHAIN-3-finish recon §(f) (2026-06-17):** the route is the
  **`⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line** route (point-join + panel-meet both in `range(⋀^{d−1}W
  ↪)`, a line), NOT the d=3 `Φ̃ = dualAnnihilator` route. The panel-meet is
  `complementIso (k:=d−1)(j:=2)` (`j=2` — a line has **2** normals at every `d`,
  not `d−1`). **`finrank_sup_range_wedgeFixedLeft` / `extensor_toDual_extensor_eq
  _zero_of_perp` do NOT generalize and are NOT needed** (they are the d=3-only
  `Φ̃`/`Ω` route, sound only because `dim Ω = C(d−1,2) = 1` at `d=3`). The one
  genuinely-new leaf is the **panel-meet range-membership** (OD-8). Pinned
  signatures + leaf sequence: §(f); the open route choice: OD-8 §(g).
- **CHAIN-4 — the `Fin (d+1)` incidence + Claim-6.12 discriminator**
  (`Claim612.lean`). **Two mechanical bricks LANDED 2026-06-18**
  (`exists_independent_perp_pair_gen`, `omitTwoExtensor_eq_extensor_kept_gen`);
  **OD-4 RESOLVED 2026-06-18 (§(i)): existence/homogeneous, alg-independence NOT
  forced**. **Remainder decomposed into four leaves with exact signatures in
  §(j):** CHAIN-4a `exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals` at `Fin (k+1) →
  Fin (k+2)` (the OD-4 sub-leaf, clean lift), CHAIN-4b
  `exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence` (clean lift; carries the §(i)
  one residual — the per-join panel-membership must close combinatorially),
  CHAIN-4c `case_III_claim612` (the span-`D` existential, **reusing the general
  `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` (landed 23a Leaf 2) + Lemma 2.1** — pure numeral
  lift), CHAIN-4d `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence` at
  `ScrewSpace (k)`/`Fin (k+1)` candidates, `complementIso (k:=k)(**j:=2**)` (the
  §(f)/§(i) correction — a line has 2 normals at every `d`; **not** `(j:=d−1)`),
  **consuming the landed CHAIN-3 (h-4)** `extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet`.
  *This is the eq. (6.67) finish + the `Mᵢ`-fails-iff-`r⊥C(Lᵢ)` disjunction.*
  **First buildable OD-4 leaf = CHAIN-4a.**
- **CHAIN-5 — the `d`-chain dispatch assembly** (`CaseIII/Realization.lean`).
  Replace `case_III_candidate_dispatch`: given the length-`d` chain data +
  fresh `e₀` + the IH-generic base realization `(G₁,q₁)`, build the `d`
  candidates (CHAIN-2), apply the discriminator (CHAIN-4) to pick a
  full-rank `Mᵢ`, and close via the (already general-`k`) arm closer for that
  `i` (the `ρᵢ`-relabel chain generalizing W9c's single `a↔v` swap). **Gated
  by the (b) flag** — its `hdispatch`/`hcand` signature is the
  CHAIN↔ENTRY contract (the length-`d` chain record). Discharges the
  general-`d` `hdispatch` carried by `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k_all_k` (once that
  carry's shape grows to the length-`d` chain, (b)). Keep the `d=3` dispatch as
  a `k=2`/length-3 wrapper so the `d=3` line stays green.

### (d) Green-modulo boundary CHAIN hands downstream

After CHAIN, the carried `hdispatch` is **discharged at general `k`** (modulo
the (b) producer reshape, which CHAIN co-owns with ENTRY). CHAIN additionally
**unblocks the M4-forget producer** `exists_extensor_eq_panelSupportExtensor`
(it routes through the `⋀²ℝ⁴` duality `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join`,
CHAIN-3) — so once CHAIN-3 lands, **`hforget_k`** (the M4 forget map,
`hasPanelRealization_of_generic`, `GenericityDevice.lean:1936/1945`) lifts to
general `k`, and **through it `hbase_k`/`hcut_k`/`hcontract_k`** (every
conditioned-pair producer routes its bare `HasPanelRealization` half through the
forget map — the 23a Leaf-5 finding). **So the four 23a-carried producers fold
into CHAIN's tail** (after CHAIN-3's duality), as the §"CHAIN" scope expansion
predicted — see (e) OD-7 for the fold-vs-successor decision. What CHAIN does
**not** discharge, leaving to downstream:
- **ENTRY** owns the length-`d` chain *extraction* (the reshaped
  `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` → chain; Lemma 4.6 dichotomy + Lemma 4.8
  split-off + the short-cycle base Lemma 5.4 branch) and the `hD : 6 ≤
  bodyBarDim n` floor lift. The chain-data record shape is the CHAIN↔ENTRY
  contract ((b)).
- **ASSEMBLY** composes the honest general-`d` Theorem 5.5 (the `hdispatch`/
  four-producer carries now discharged), re-greens `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`
  + `hub`, derives Thm 5.6, states Conjecture 1.2.

### (e) CHAIN-specific open decisions

- **OD-6 — DECIDED: two leaves within one CHAIN sub-phase (no new letter for
  the duality), but with a CHAIN/ENTRY co-design dependency.** The two hard
  cores are dependency-ordered into one layer: the `⋀^{d−1}` duality (CHAIN-3)
  is *consumed by* the Claim-6.12 discriminator (CHAIN-4), which is *consumed
  by* the dispatch assembly (CHAIN-5); the chain bookkeeping (CHAIN-1/2) feeds
  CHAIN-5 in parallel. They are five leaves of **one** sub-phase 23b, not a
  split — the arm-realization engine they all feed is already general-`k`
  (verified (a)), so neither core stands alone as a deliverable. *Rationale for
  not minting a separate duality letter:* the duality is not a self-contained
  target (it has no consumer outside CHAIN-4/5 and the M4-forget lift), unlike
  21a's meet foundations (which seeded the whole panel layer). If CHAIN-2's
  index bookkeeping proves larger than estimated, **split at contact** into 23b
  (duality + discriminator CHAIN-3/4, which also unblocks the four producers)
  + a later-minted letter (chain bookkeeping CHAIN-1/2/5) — but open as one.
- **OD-7 — DECIDED: the four 23a-carried producers fold into CHAIN's tail
  (after CHAIN-3), not a dedicated successor sub-phase.** Verified ((d)): the
  M4-forget `exists_extensor_eq_panelSupportExtensor` is *the same `⋀²ℝ⁴`
  duality* CHAIN-3 lifts, and `hbase_k`/`hcut_k`/`hcontract_k` route through M4
  for their bare half. So the producer lift is a **direct corollary of CHAIN-3**
  (numeral pass on the producers once their one `Fin 4`-duality reach-in lifts),
  not new mathematics — folding it avoids a successor sub-phase that would
  re-open the same files. *Caveat:* the producers also carry `Fin 4` panel
  geometry beyond the forget call (the 23a Leaf-5 finding said they "bottom out
  in `q : α × Fin 4` panel geometry **and** the duality"); the detailed-build
  recon at CHAIN open must confirm the *only* genuinely-`d=3` reach-in is the
  duality (i.e. the rest is the numeral pass), else the fold is larger than a
  corollary. Present as a fold with this caveat flagged.
- **OD-4 — RESOLVED 2026-06-18: existence/homogeneous route, alg-independence
  NOT forced.** Full verdict + reasoning in §(i) below. The prior "forced" lean
  followed KT's *affine* phrasing (p. 698: `d+1` affinely-independent points →
  `(d−2)`-flats in `⋃Πⱼ` → "any `j` hyperplanes meet in a `(d−j)`-flat" by
  alg-independence). But the **landed d=3 formalization never takes that route**:
  it works homogeneously (§1.42 R1-affine), so the eq.-(6.67) `dim = D` is driven
  by **linear independence of `d+1` homogeneous vectors** (`span_omitTwoExtensor_
  eq_top`, already general-`k`, only hyp `LinearIndependent ℝ pbar`, via Lemma
  2.1) — **no affine independence, no alg-independence, no `(d−j)`-flat fact.**
  The row #106 cross-product construction (whose non-generalization motivated the
  "forced" lean) is **dead — zero live call sites** (verified); the live d=3
  dispatch consumes `exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals` (linear, only hyp
  `LinearIndependent ℝ n`). The per-join panel-membership generalizes purely
  combinatorially (join `{a,b}` ⊂ `Πᵢ` iff `i+1∈{a,b}`; §(i)). **No new
  `AlgebraicIndependent`-driven lemma needed.** Alg-independence stays live only
  at site (a) (the nested seed-rank transfer, `AlgebraicIndependence.md` row #107,
  carrier-lifted, unchanged); site (b)/eq.-(6.67) is **not** a site. CHAIN-4
  decomposition: §(j). One build-time residual flagged (the §(i) per-join
  membership must close from the orthogonality hyps alone — CHAIN-4b's job).
- **OD-1 (carried from §4, re-confirmed for CHAIN/ENTRY).** The short-cycle
  base (KT Lemma 5.4, "if `G` is a cycle of length ≤ `d`, done by Lemma 5.4")
  is a **real branch of the general-`d` chain entry** (KT p. 692), unlike `d=3`
  (triangle floor handled inline). Whether CHAIN's dispatch can assume the chain
  branch (ENTRY discharging the cycle branch separately) or must handle a degenerate
  chain is an ENTRY-contract question — flag at CHAIN open, do not pre-commit.

### (f) CHAIN-3-finish recon — the `⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line route (corrects the `Φ̃` pin)

**Status:** detailed-build recon, docs-only, 2026-06-17, source-verified against
KT §6.4.1/§6.4.2 (eqs. 6.45–6.67 read end-to-end, page 698 the eq.-6.67 finish)
+ the landed `Meet.lean` bodies + the three already-landed `_grade` bricks. This
sub-section settles the route for CHAIN-3's two remaining pieces
(`finrank_sup_range_wedgeFixedLeft` and `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` at
general `d`) and **overturns the prior pin** (checklist + *Hand-off*) on both.

**The geometry, corrected (the load-bearing fact the prior pin got wrong).** The
per-line duality is about a single line `L = Lᵢ` — KT's `(d−2)`-dimensional
affine subspace, homogeneous span `dim = d−1` in `ℝ^{d+1}`. Two counts follow
and they are **fixed across `d`, not growing**:
- **Normals: exactly 2 at every `d`.** `dim L^⊥ = (d+1) − (d−1) = 2`. The panel-
  meet is the meet of the **2** hyperplanes through `L`: `complementIso(extensor
  ![n_u, n']) ∈ ⋀^{d−1}`, input grade `j = 2` (NOT `j = d−1`), output grade
  `(d+1) − 2 = d−1`. *The prior pin's `complementIso (k:=d−1)(j:=d−1)` is wrong;*
  it is `complementIso (k:=d−1)(j:=2)` (`k=2,j=2` at `d=3` by `d−1=2`, masking
  the error). The d=3 `exists_independent_perp_pair` (find the 2nd normal in
  `L^⊥`) lifts cleanly (ambient `Fin (d+1)`, point family `Fin (d−1)`; the common
  perp has `dim ≥ 2`, so a 2nd independent normal always exists).
- **Points: `d−1` (not 2).** `L` is spanned by `d−1` points; the point-join is
  the **`(d−1)`-extensor** `extensor (p : Fin (d−1) → ℝ^{d+1}) ∈ ⋀^{d−1}` (KT
  p. 698 verbatim: *"any `(d−1)`-extensor obtained from `d−1` points"*). At `d=3`,
  `d−1 = 2` — the two points `![pᵢ, pⱼ]` of the d=3 code.

Both the point-join and the panel-meet are grade `d−1` (NOT grade 2 — at `d=3`
the coincidence `d−1 = 2` collapses them). For `d ≥ 4` a grade-2 point-join and a
grade-`(d−1)` panel-meet **cannot** be proportional — so the d=3 framing where
both are grade-2 is a `d−1=2` artifact.

**The route that DOES generalize (and the dead-end it replaces).** Both members
are the Plücker coordinate of the same `(d−1)`-dim subspace `W = span(L) =
{n_u, n'}^⊥`, i.e. both lie in **`⋀^{d−1}W`, which is a line** (`dim ⋀^{d−1}W =
(d−1).choose (d−1) = 1`). With the point-join nonzero, the two are proportional.
This is **exactly the route the three already-landed `_grade` bricks were built
for** (they have NO consumers in tree — grep-confirmed — they were landed
*forward* for this): `extensor_mem_range_map_subtype_of_mem_grade` (point-join ∈
`range(⋀^{d−1}W ↪ ⋀^{d−1}ℝ^{d+1})`), `exteriorPower_map_subtype_injective_grade`
+ `finrank_exteriorPower_self_eq_one` (that range is a line), and
`exists_smul_eq_of_mem_range_map_subtype_grade` (two members of it are
proportional). The `exists_smul_…_grade` docstring already says the
proportionality *"lives in `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})` itself, so no pull-back … is
needed."*

**Consequence — the two prior-pinned leaves are DEAD ENDS at general `d`:**
- **`finrank_sup_range_wedgeFixedLeft` (the `dim Φ̃ = 5` count) does NOT
  generalize and is NOT needed.** Its `Φ̃ = n_u ∧ ℝ⁴ ⊔ n' ∧ ℝ⁴` /
  `Ω = dualAnnihilator Φ̃` machinery is the **d=3-only "route A-corrected"
  (Phase 22f)**. `Φ̃` is built from the **2** normals, so `dim Φ̃ =
  dim(span{n_u,n'} ∧ ℝ^{d+1}) = C(d+1,2) − C(d−1,2)`, giving `dim Ω = C(d−1,2)`,
  which is `1` **only at `d=3`** (`C(2,2)=1`); for `d≥4` it is `> 1`, so the
  `Ω`-is-a-line argument breaks. The prior pin's "`(d−1)`-summand inclusion–
  exclusion / `A ∧ ℝ^{d+1}` codimension `D−1`" both rest on the false `dim A =
  d−1` (`A` has dim 2, not `d−1`). **Do not generalize this lemma.** Leave the
  d=3 `finrank_sup_range_wedgeFixedLeft` / `inf_range_wedgeFixedLeft` /
  `wedgeFixedLeft` / `extensor_toDual_extensor_eq_zero_of_perp` /
  `complementIso_toDual_extensor_eq_zero_of_shared_vector` as the green d=3
  route (the `d=3` `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` keeps using them).
- **`extensor_toDual_extensor_eq_zero_of_perp` does NOT lift either** — it is the
  Gram-determinant orthogonality feeding the dead `Ω`-route; the general-`d`
  finish never calls it.

**The one genuinely-new leaf: the panel-meet range-membership** `complementIso
(k:=d−1)(j:=2) ⟨extensor ![n_u, n'], _⟩ ∈ range(⋀^{d−1}W ↪ ⋀^{d−1}ℝ^{d+1})` for
`W = {n_u, n'}^⊥` (`dim W = d−1`). This is the never-completed **N3b-2b-α** (at
`d=3` the assembly bypassed it via the `Φ̃`/`Ω` route, so it was *never proved at
any `d`*). Geometrically true (the complement of the decomposable `n_u ∧ n'` is
the `(d−1)`-extensor of `(n_u ∧ n')^⊥ = W`). **Two candidate sub-routes, OD-8
below — flagged, not pre-committed.** What IS in hand: the general
`complementIso_toDual_eq_zero_of_wedgeProd_eq_zero` ({j} hj, LANDED) gives
`toDual`-*annihilation* of the panel-meet by any `(d−1)`-extensor sharing a
factor with `n_u ∧ n'`; range-*membership* is the upgrade.

**Pinned signatures (the CHAIN-3 finish).**
**Phrase `k`-parametrically (`k = d−1`), ambient `Fin (k+2)`, conclusion `⋀^k`.**
This matches the all-`k` engine convention (`ScrewSpace k`, `complementIso (k:=…)`,
`screwDim k`) AND **dodges a real cast trap** (verified in scratch): with `k` written
as `d−1`, the ambient `Fin ((d−1)+2)` is NOT defeq to `Fin (d+1)` for a *variable* `d`
(`(d−1)+2` reduces only under `d ≥ 1`), so `extensor n` (typed `Fin (d+1)`) clashes with
`complementIso (k:=d−1)`'s `Fin ((d−1)+2)` domain. Writing the lemma in `k` with ambient
`Fin (k+2)` makes `k+2−2 = k` and the domains defeq; the `d=3` wrapper instantiates
`k := 2` (then `k+2 = 4 = 3+1` defeq). The `d−1` points spanning `L`, with `k = d−1`, are
the family `p : Fin k → Fin (k+2) → ℝ`; the point-join `extensor p ∈ ⋀^k (Fin (k+2))` — grade
`k`, matching the panel-meet's output grade `(k+2)−2 = k`. ✓
1. The general-`d` per-line duality (replaces the d=3
   `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join`; the d=3 line becomes the `k=2` wrapper):
   ```
   theorem extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet {k : ℕ}
       (n : Fin 2 → Fin (k + 2) → ℝ)         -- the two line-normals n_u, n'
       (p : Fin k → Fin (k + 2) → ℝ)         -- the k = d−1 points spanning L
       (hp  : LinearIndependent ℝ p)         -- so the point-join ≠ 0
       (hpair : LinearIndependent ℝ n)
       (hperp : ∀ i j, (Pi.basisFun ℝ (Fin (k+2))).toDual (p i) (n j) = 0) :
       ∃ c : ℝ, c • (complementIso (k := k) (j := 2) (by omega)
           ⟨extensor n, extensor_mem_exteriorPower n⟩)
         = (⟨extensor p, extensor_mem_exteriorPower p⟩ : ⋀[ℝ]^k (Fin (k+2) → ℝ))
   ```
   Body: set `W = {n_u,n'}^⊥` (`dim W = (k+2)−2 = k` by rank–nullity on the 2
   functionals `⟨·,n_u⟩,⟨·,n'⟩`, `= k` since the `k` independent points `p` lie in it);
   point-join ∈ `range(⋀^k W)` by `extensor_mem_range_map_subtype_of_mem_grade`
   (each `p i ∈ W` from `hperp`; **note** that brick is stated at grade `d−1`/ambient
   `d+1` — its `k`-form is `(d := k+1)`, `d−1 = k`, `d+1 = k+2`, defeq); panel-meet ∈
   `range(⋀^k W)` by the new leaf (2); point-join ≠ 0 by `hp` +
   `extensor_ne_zero_iff_linearIndependent`; close by
   `exists_smul_eq_of_mem_range_map_subtype_grade` (its `(d := k+1)` form). The d=3
   `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` becomes `:= …_meet (k := 2) …` (`k = 2`,
   `Fin 4`, the 2-point case `p = ![pi, pj]`).
2. The new range-membership leaf (the one genuinely-new piece):
   ```
   theorem complementIso_extensor_mem_range_map_subtype {k : ℕ}
       (n : Fin 2 → Fin (k + 2) → ℝ) (W : Submodule ℝ (Fin (k + 2) → ℝ))
       (hWperp : ∀ w ∈ W, ∀ j, (Pi.basisFun ℝ (Fin (k+2))).toDual w (n j) = 0)
       (hWdim : Module.finrank ℝ W = k) :
       (complementIso (k := k) (j := 2) (by omega)
           ⟨extensor n, extensor_mem_exteriorPower n⟩)
         ∈ LinearMap.range (exteriorPower.map k W.subtype)
   ```

**Buildable-leaf sequence (CHAIN-3 finish), dependency-ordered:**
1. *(no-op)* confirm the d=3 `finrank_sup_range_wedgeFixedLeft` /
   `extensor_toDual_extensor_eq_zero_of_perp` stay as the **green d=3** route —
   do NOT touch (the prior checklist's "generalize these" items are withdrawn).
2. `complementIso_extensor_mem_range_map_subtype` — **the new leaf** (route per
   OD-8). Consumes the general `complementIso_toDual_eq_zero_of_wedgeProd_eq_zero`
   (LANDED) + `finrank_exteriorPower_self_eq_one` (LANDED).
3. `extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet` — the assembly; consumes (2) +
   the three landed `_grade` bricks. **Zero new count work.**
4. The `d=3` wrapper (zero regression): the existing
   `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` (the `Φ̃`-route body) stays as-is and the
   d=3 discriminator keeps calling it; OR re-point the discriminator at the new
   general lemma's `d=3` instance once (2)/(3) land. *Recommend keeping the d=3
   body* (it is green and the new route needs (2) first) — re-point is a CHAIN-4
   decision, not forced here.

**Hands to CHAIN-4.** CHAIN-4's discriminator
(`exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence`, the contrapositive that
some `Mᵢ` has full rank) consumes the per-line duality (3) the way the d=3
`extensor_join_eq_zero_of_complementIso_eq_zero_dotProduct` consumes the d=3
`complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join`. The eq.-(6.67) `D`-span (the `d+1`-point /
Lemma-2.1 argument, which IS the `dim = D` count — and is **separate** from the
per-line `Φ̃`) stays CHAIN-4's, gated by **OD-4** (the alg-independence route,
still flagged open).

**Coordinator KT-route check (2026-06-17, against KT p. 697–698, eqs. 6.65–6.67
read end-to-end).** Confirmed the `⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line route IS KT's argument, not
a convenient substitute. KT proves (6.65) some `Mᵢ` is full rank by: (6.66) `Mᵢ`
fails full rank ⟺ `r ⊥ span C(Lᵢ)`, where `C(Lᵢ)` is *the `(d−1)`-extensor of the
flat `Lᵢ`*; (6.67) so none is full rank ⟺ `r ⊥ span(⋃ᵢ C(Lᵢ))`, and
`dim span(⋃ C(Lᵢ)) = C(d+1, d−1) = D` via `d+1` affinely-independent points (any
`(d−1)`-extensor of `d−1` of them is some `C(Lᵢ)`) **by Lemma 2.1**. The faithfulness
point: **KT writes `C(Lᵢ)` agnostically** — as the *meet* of the 2 panels cutting
out `Lᵢ` (the rank side, 6.66 / CHAIN-2) AND as the *join* of `d−1` points spanning
`Lᵢ` (the `D`-span side, 6.67 / CHAIN-4). **CHAIN-3's
`extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet` formalizes the join=meet equality KT
leaves implicit** — the one step the Lean must spell out (a BlueprintExposition-grade
node). The withdrawn `Φ̃`/`finrank_sup_range`/`Ω = dualAnnihilator` machinery is a
`d=3`-only *formalization* artifact (Phase 22f's "route A-corrected"), **not** in KT
— KT works directly with the `C(Lᵢ)` extensors, so the re-route moves the
formalization *toward* KT. (The per-line rank↔orthogonality ±r chain, 6.66, is
CHAIN-2; the `D`-span, 6.67's `d+1` points + Lemma 2.1, is CHAIN-4 / OD-4.)

### (g) CHAIN-specific open decision OD-8 (the panel-meet range-membership route)

- **OD-8 — FLAGGED (genuinely open; the one design call the CHAIN-3 finish
  cannot settle from the source alone).** `complementIso (j:=2) ⟨n_u ∧ n', _⟩ ∈
  range(⋀^{d−1}W ↪)` for `W = {n_u, n'}^⊥`. In hand:
  `complementIso_toDual_eq_zero_of_wedgeProd_eq_zero` gives the *annihilation*
  (the panel-meet is `toDual`-killed by every `(d−1)`-extensor sharing a factor
  with `n_u ∧ n'`). Two candidate routes to upgrade annihilation → membership:
  - **(α) Hodge/complement-direct.** Prove `complementIso (k:=d−1)(j:=2)` carries
    `⋀²(span{n_u,n'})` into `⋀^{d−1}({n_u,n'}^⊥) = ⋀^{d−1}W` — a "the complement
    of a decomposable lives in the exterior power of its orthogonal complement"
    fact. Cleanest geometrically; needs a `complementIso`-image-of-`⋀²S` lemma
    not currently in `Meet.lean` (a small new `complementIso` API leaf, NOT a new
    mathlib-level fact — built from the landed `complementIso_toDual` dictionary).
  - **(β) annihilator = range, via the perfect pairing.** `range(⋀^{d−1}W ↪)` is
    a line (LANDED bricks); show it *equals* the annihilator subspace the
    panel-meet is known (by the in-hand annihilation) to lie in, by a dimension match
    (`dim range = 1 = dim {Z : ⋀^{d−1} | Z ⊥ …}`). Reuses the landed annihilator-
    count machinery but needs the right "`⋀^{d−1}W` = annihilator of `⋀^{d−1}` of
    the `wedge-with-n` images" identification — closer to the d=3 `Φ̃` idea but
    in the correct grade `d−1` with `dim W = d−1`.
  - *Recommendation:* (α) is the cleaner target (a 1–2-decl `complementIso` API
    addition); attempt (α) first, fall back to (β). **Neither needs a new
    mathlib-level fact** (clause (ii) clear: no missing `dim(A∧V)` lemma, no
    Hodge-star API — the count is the LANDED `finrank_exteriorPower_self_eq_one`,
    not a `finrank_sup`). The decision is the *internal* `complementIso`-image
    characterization, settled at build. **This is the only genuinely-open piece
    of the CHAIN-3 finish.**

  > **OD-8 SETTLED by §(h) below (2026-06-17 OD-8 design-pass).** The §(g)
  > recommendation is **superseded**: (α) is the right route but is **NOT** "a
  > 1–2-decl `complementIso` API addition" — its load-bearing step is
  > `complementIso`'s **O(n)-equivariance**, a substantial new sub-lemma flagged
  > as its own leaf. (β) is **not** a safe fallback (its dimension count is the
  > grade-2-vs-grade-`k` `dim Φ̃` trap §(f) already withdrew). See §(h) for the
  > pinned decomposition and the clause-(ii) flag.

### (h) OD-8 design-pass — the route decision for the panel-meet range-membership

**Status:** OD-8 design-pass, docs-only, 2026-06-17. Source-verified against the
**landed** `Meet.lean` bodies (the `complementIso` `def`/`wedgePairing`/
`screwAlgebraTopEquiv` construction read end-to-end, the in-hand annihilation
`complementIso_toDual_eq_zero_of_wedgeProd_eq_zero`, the three landed `_grade`
bricks, the landed base case + standard-frame membership) and against mathlib
(`lean_loogle`/`lean_leanfinder`: no Hodge-star / decomposable-complement API).
LSP-probed: the proportionality engine `exists_smul_eq_of_mem_range_map_subtype_grade`
and the line count `finrank (range (⋀^k W ↪)) = 1` for `dim W = k` both close at
general `k` (scratch, reverted) — **so the entire OD-8 crux reduces to one
membership: `complementIso (j:=2) n ∈ range(⋀^k W.subtype)`.** Everything else of
the CHAIN-3 finish is free once that lands.

**The decisive structural fact (verified against the landed `def`).**
`complementIso` is built as `(wedgePairing as equiv) ≪≫ toDualEquiv.symm`, where
`wedgePairing k hj A B = screwAlgebraTopEquiv (A ∨ₑ B)` and `screwAlgebraTopEquiv
= exteriorPower.topEquiv (k+2)` is the **standard volume form**, and the dual side
uses `(Pi.basisFun …).exteriorPower (…).toDual`, whose `Pi.basisFun.toDual` is the
**standard dot product** (`Module.Basis.toDual_apply` = Kronecker δ). So
`complementIso` **is the Hodge star `⋆` for the standard Euclidean structure on
`ℝ^{k+2}`** (volume form + dot product), up to the unit volume normalization. The
target `complementIso (n₀∧n₁) ∈ ⋀^k W` for `W = {n₀,n₁}^⊥` is therefore the
genuine **Hodge fact**: *`⋆` of a decomposable is the decomposable of the
orthogonal complement* (`⋆(n₀∧n₁) = ±` the `k`-extensor of an oriented orthonormal
basis of `(span{n₀,n₁})^⊥ = W`). This is **true and standard**, but it is the
central nontrivial content — the §(g) framing "cleanest geometrically; a small
`complementIso`-image leaf" **understated it** by reading the in-hand
*annihilation* as if it already were *membership* (it is not — see below).

**Why the in-hand annihilation does NOT directly give membership.** The LANDED
`complementIso_toDual_eq_zero_of_wedgeProd_eq_zero` gives: `b.toDual (complementIso
n) B = vol(n ∨ₑ B) = 0` whenever `n ∨ₑ B = 0`. Equivalently `complementIso n`
lies in the `b.toDual`-annihilator `Ann(Φ)` of `Φ := span{B ∈ ⋀^k : n ∨ₑ B = 0}`
(the `B` sharing a factor with `span{n₀,n₁}`). The point-join `x = extensor(w)`
(`w` a basis of `W`) also lies in `Ann(Φ)` and in the line `L = range(⋀^k W ↪)`.
**To conclude `complementIso n ∈ L` from this one needs `L = Ann(Φ)`, i.e.
`dim Ann(Φ) = 1`, i.e. `dim Φ = D − 1`.** That count is exactly the
**withdrawn `finrank_sup_range_wedgeFixedLeft`/`dim Φ̃` family** — §(f) proved it
does NOT generalize off `d=3` (at grade `k`, `dim Ann(Φ) = C(d−1,2) > 1` for
`d ≥ 4` if `Φ` is taken the d=3 way). **So the annihilation→membership upgrade is
NOT a free dimension match; it is the Hodge fact itself.** This kills the §(g)
"(β) is a clean fallback" sentence — restated honestly below.

**Route decision: (α), via `complementIso`'s O(n)-equivariance.** The route that
genuinely closes — and the only one not re-introducing a withdrawn count — is:

1. **`complementIso` is O(n)-equivariant** (the new sub-leaf, flagged clause (ii)).
   For `O : Fin (k+2) → ℝ` an orthogonal change of frame (preserves the standard
   dot product, so `det O = ±1`), `complementIso (j:=2)` intertwines
   `exteriorPower.map 2 O` and `exteriorPower.map k O` up to the sign `det O`:
   `complementIso (exteriorPower.map 2 O X) = (det O) • exteriorPower.map k O
   (complementIso X)`. This rests on two transformation facts: the volume form
   transforms by the determinant (`screwAlgebraTopEquiv (map (k+2) O · ) = det O ·
   screwAlgebraTopEquiv`, **no ready mathlib lemma** — build from
   `exteriorPower.map`/`topEquiv` + `det`; cf. `LinearMap.det` /
   `exteriorPower.alternatingMapToDual_apply_ιMulti`) and the dot product is
   O-invariant (`Pi.basisFun.toDual (O w) (O v) = Pi.basisFun.toDual w v`,
   `O` orthogonal). This is the substantive new mathematics; it is **not** a
   1–2-decl API addition — it is the genuine reason `complementIso` (Hodge `⋆`)
   is *O(n)*-natural but **not** *GL*-natural (the §(g)/checklist warning).
2. **Frame alignment.** Build an orthogonal `O` carrying `span{n₀,n₁}` to the
   coordinate `2`-plane `span{e₀,e₁}` (Gram–Schmidt on `n₀,n₁`, extend to an
   orthonormal basis of `ℝ^{k+2}`; mathlib `Basis`/orthonormal-extension API).
   Under `O`, `W = {n₀,n₁}^⊥` maps to `span{e₂,…,e_{k+1}}` (a coordinate
   subspace), `extensor n` maps (up to scalar) to the coordinate blade `e_{01}`.
3. **Invoke the LANDED standard-frame membership.**
   `complementIso_exteriorPower_basis_mem_range_map_subtype` gives the conclusion
   for the coordinate blade `e_{01}` and the coordinate `W' = O(W)`; transport
   back along `O` (a linear iso, so `range(⋀^k W ↪)` transports) by (1)+(2).

This honestly names a remaining obstacle (the O(n)-equivariance + the
volume-form-determinant fact) rather than asserting a one-liner a build would
faithfully mis-scope. **It needs no new *mathlib-level* fact** in the sense of a
missing Hodge-star *API* — every ingredient (`exteriorPower.map`, `topEquiv`,
`LinearMap.det`, orthonormal extension) is in mathlib — **but it does need a
genuine new *project-side* sub-lemma** (the equivariance), which is itself the
crux. Clause (ii) verdict: **flag the O(n)-equivariance as its own buildable leaf
(`complementIso_map_orthogonal_eq`-shaped); do not pre-commit it as cheap.**

**Pinned leaf sequence for OD-8 (route α), dependency-ordered:**
- **(h-0)** `screwAlgebraTopEquiv_map_eq_det_smul` (or inline) — the volume form
  transforms by the determinant under `exteriorPower.map (k+2) f`. New; mathlib
  has the pieces, not the fused lemma. *Flagged: confirm the cleanest mathlib
  handle at build (`exteriorPower.map`+`topEquiv`+`det`).*
- **(h-1)** `complementIso_map_orthogonal_eq` — `complementIso`'s O(n)-equivariance
  (the substantive leaf). Consumes (h-0) + dot-product O-invariance. **The OD-8
  clause-(ii) flag lives here.**
- **(h-2)** `exists_orthogonal_map_span_pair_eq_coordPlane` — orthonormal
  alignment carrying `span{n₀,n₁}` to `span{e₀,e₁}` (Gram–Schmidt / orthonormal
  extension; mathlib `Basis` API). Combinatorial-geometry, no `complementIso`.
- **(h-3)** `complementIso_extensor_mem_range_map_subtype` — the target leaf
  (signature §(f) item 2): assemble (h-1)+(h-2)+the LANDED
  `complementIso_exteriorPower_basis_mem_range_map_subtype`. The `extensor n = 0`
  (dependent `n`) case is trivial (`complementIso 0 = 0 ∈ range`); the work is the
  `n`-independent case, where `dim W = k` holds (rank–nullity on the 2 functionals).
  **The build surfaced an input step §(h) glossed** (`extensor n = c • blade`): it
  needs a genuine grade-2 proportionality + a grade-decoupled membership brick, now
  **LANDED** (`exists_smul_extensor_eq_of_mem_span_range` +
  `extensor_mem_range_map_subtype_of_mem_jgrade`, `Meet.lean`, 2026-06-17). The remaining
  (h-3) work is the metric composition; the `W = {n}^⊥` dimension step is the one untested
  piece (rolling detail in `notes/Phase23b.md` *Hand-off*).
- **(h-4)** `extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet` — the assembly
  (signature §(f) item 1): consumes (h-3) + the three LANDED `_grade` bricks. Zero
  new count. **Hands the CHAIN-4 discriminator the join=meet proportionality**
  (the step KT leaves implicit — a BlueprintExposition-grade node per the
  coordinator KT-route check §(f)).
- **(h-5)** the `d=3` wrapper `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` stays green
  (its `Φ̃`-route body unchanged; re-point is a CHAIN-4 decision, not forced).

**Honest fallback if (h-1) proves a long pole.** Route (β) is **rejected as a
fallback** (it re-introduces the withdrawn `dim Φ` count, §(f)). The genuine
fallback is to **state (h-3) as an explicit green-modulo hypothesis** on the
CHAIN-4 discriminator (the project's standing idiom) and land (h-1)/(h-3) in a
dedicated follow-on sitting — i.e. if the O(n)-equivariance does not close in one
build, it becomes its own leaf carried as an `h…` premise, never a `sorry`. This
keeps CHAIN-1/2/4/5 unblocked while (h-1) is the one open math obligation.

**What the finished OD-8 leaf hands the assembly.** `complementIso_extensor_mem_
range_map_subtype` (h-3) places the panel-meet `complementIso (n₀∧n₁)` in the line
`range(⋀^k W ↪)`; with the point-join already there (LANDED
`extensor_mem_range_map_subtype_of_mem_grade`) and the proportionality engine
(LANDED), (h-4) yields `extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet` — the
per-line point-join↔panel-meet duality CHAIN-4's discriminator
(`exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence`) consumes (the way the
d=3 discriminator consumes `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join`). That closes
CHAIN-3; the eq.-(6.67) `D`-span finish (the `d+1`-points / Lemma-2.1 argument)
stays CHAIN-4, gated by OD-4.

### (i) OD-4 design-pass — the eq.-(6.67) N3a route is RESOLVED: existence/homogeneous, NOT alg-independence

**Status:** OD-4 detailed-build recon, docs-only, 2026-06-18, source-verified
against (i) the KT 2011 PDF p. 698 (eq. 6.67, the `d+1`-points / alg-independence
finish, read verbatim) and (ii) the **landed** `Claim612.lean` bodies —
`exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals` (393), `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top`
(58), `case_III_claim612` (1064), `exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence`
(549), the live d=3 dispatch call site (`Realization.lean:371`) — and the three
existence-route bricks (`exists_ne_zero_dotProduct_eq_zero` 119,
`exists_affineIndependent_of_det_polynomial_ne_zero` 161,
`exists_detPolynomial_of_pointPolynomial` 190). The prior pin (OD-4 in §(e),
`AlgebraicIndependence.md` row #107(b)) leaned **"forced"**; this pass **overturns
that lean**: alg-independence is **NOT forced** — the formalization's d=3 route
already sidesteps KT's alg-independence argument, and that re-route generalizes.

**VERDICT: existence/homogeneous route — alg-independence is NOT a new site.**
The eq.-(6.67) N3a step (showing `dim span ⋃ C(Lᵢ) = D`, forcing some `Mᵢ` full
rank) lifts as a **mechanical numeral generalization of the already-green d=3
bricks**, with no `AlgebraicIndependent` obligation. The only genuinely-new work
is the `Fin (d+1)` re-statement of `exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals` and
its line-data dispatch — both combinatorial/linear-algebra, no genericity device.

**Why the prior "forced" lean was wrong (the decisive structural fact).** The
prior reasoning followed **KT's affine phrasing** — KT (p. 698) takes `d+1`
*affinely-independent points* `p₀…p_d`, observes any `(d−1)` of them span a
`(d−2)`-flat lying in `⋃Πⱼ`, and gets `dim = D` "by Lemma 2.1" — and the
`(d−2)`-flat-in-union step *is* where KT invokes alg-independence ("for any `j`
hyperplanes their intersection forms a `(d−j)`-flat"). But the **landed d=3
formalization never takes this route.** It works at the **homogeneous-vector
layer** (the §1.42 R1-affine decision), and the D-span is driven by **linear
independence of `d+1` homogeneous vectors**, not affine independence of `d+1`
points:
- `case_III_claim612` (the D-span existential) calls
  `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top hp` whose **only** hypothesis is
  `hp : LinearIndependent ℝ pbar` (pbar : Fin (k+2) → Fin (k+2) → ℝ). The `D =
  (k+2 choose 2)` omit-two extensors of `k+2` LI homogeneous vectors are LI by
  **Lemma 2.1** (`omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent_of_li`, `{e:ℕ}`, general) and
  hence a basis of the D-dim `ScrewSpace k` — they span. **`span_omitTwoExtensor_
  eq_top` is ALREADY general-`k` (line 58); zero affine independence, zero
  alg-independence, zero `(d−2)`-flat-in-union.**
- The `pbar` itself comes from `exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals`, which
  produces `LinearIndependent ℝ pbar` from the **row-matrix surjectivity** of the
  `d × (d+1)` panel-normal matrix (`LinearIndependent.rank_matrix` ⟹ rank `d` ⟹
  `mulVecLin` surjective onto `ℝ^d` ⟹ preimages of standard targets) plus a
  triangular LI argument. Its **only** genericity input is `LinearIndependent ℝ n`
  (the `d` chain-panel normals nonparallel) — read off the GP split-leg. **No
  cross-products, no triple-intersection, no alg-independence.**

So the row #106 explicit construction (`p₁` = triple-intersection via Cramer/
cross-products, `pᵢ = p₁ + sᵢ·(nⱼ×nₖ)`) and the affine-route bricks
(`exists_affineIndependent_panel_incidence`,
`exists_affineIndependent_of_det_polynomial_ne_zero`,
`exists_detPolynomial_of_pointPolynomial`,
`omitTwoExtensor_homogenize_eq_extensor_kept`,
`exists_hduality_witness_of_panel_incidence`) are **DEAD — verified zero live
call sites** on the dispatch path (grep, 2026-06-18: they appear only in
docstrings + their own defs; the live d=3 dispatch at `Realization.lean:371`
consumes `exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals`). They are abandoned earlier-
design scaffolding the §1.42 homogeneous re-route superseded. **The OD-4 question
"does the cross-product construction generalize" is moot — that construction is
not on the live route at d=3, so its non-generalization (correctly noted in row
#107(b)) does not force anything.** The question that actually matters is whether
the *homogeneous* route generalizes, and it does (below).

**The per-line panel-membership generalizes purely combinatorially (the one place
one might fear alg-independence re-enters).** The discriminator needs, for each of
the `D` spanning joins, a panel `Πᵤ` the join's line lies in (CHAIN-3's per-line
duality then transfers `r(join)≠0` to `r(C(Lᵤ))≠0`). At d=3 this is the finite
`htwo`/`hone` dispatch in `exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence`. It
generalizes from the incidence pattern alone — **no `(d−2)`-flat-in-union fact
needed.** Verified combinatorics (scratch, 2026-06-18): with the general pattern
`pbar 0 ⊥` all `d` normals and `pbar (i+1) ⊥` all but `n i`, the unique point off
`Πᵢ` is `pbar (i+1)`, so the line of join `{a,b}` (kept points = complement of
the omitted pair) lies in `Πᵢ` **iff `i+1 ∈ {a,b}`**. Hence every join lies in
**1 panel** (when `0 ∈ {a,b}`: `d` such joins, second normal from the landed
general `exists_independent_perp_pair_gen`) or **2 panels** (when `a,b ≥ 1`:
`C(d,2)` such joins) — exactly the d=3 `hone`/`htwo` split, scaled to `D = d +
C(d,2)` joins (`d=3 ⟹ 3+3=6 ✓`; `d=4 ⟹ 4+6=10`). This panel-membership is a
property of the **orthogonality hypotheses of `pbar` against `n`**, provable
directly — it does **not** reconstruct KT's geometric `(d−2)`-flat-in-union claim.
KT's affine phrasing and the homogeneous re-route are two proofs of the same
`dim = D` fact; the homogeneous one (which is what the tree runs) needs only
Lemma 2.1 + linear independence.

**Where alg-independence DOES stay live (site (a), unchanged) — not site (b).**
Per `AlgebraicIndependence.md` row #107, Phase 23 has two candidate sites: **(a)**
the footnote-6 seed-rank transfer along the chain (the general-`d` lift of
`case_III_nested_rank_lower`, which *already* consumes `AlgebraicIndependent ℚ q`
at d=3) and **(b)** the eq.-(6.67) N3a points step. This pass resolves **(b) is
NOT a site** (existence/homogeneous route). **(a) remains a live site** and is
**unchanged by this verdict** — it is the carrier-lifted nested-rank bridge,
already alg-independence-carrying from 22d, lifted in CARRIER(23a)/CHAIN; the
seed `q` of the IH-generic base `(G₁,q₁)` carries `AlgebraicIndependent ℚ`
regardless. The eq.-(6.67) finish does **not add** an alg-independence obligation
on top of (a).

**Clause (ii) — no genuinely-new math, no motive/IH change.** OD-4 needs **no**
new `AlgebraicIndependent`-driven non-vanishing lemma and **no** `(d−j)`-flat-
intersection lemma. The CARRIER lift already carries the seed's
`AlgebraicIndependent ℚ` for site (a); the eq.-(6.67) finish reuses the already-
general `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` + Lemma 2.1. The CHAIN-4 work is the
mechanical `Fin (d+1)` re-statement of the homogeneous-incidence chain (next
section). This is the honest, source-grounded resolution: the existence route the
pre-22d precedents (Claim 6.4/6.9) and the d=3 N3a used **does** carry to general
`d`, because the formalization phrases N3a homogeneously rather than affinely.

**Residual flag (the one honest caveat, not a blocker).** This verdict rests on
the per-join panel-membership being establishable from the incidence pattern at
general `d` *combinatorially* — verified at the *counting* level (the join↔panel
incidence `i+1 ∈ {a,b}` and the `D = d + C(d,2)` split) but **not yet built**.
The d=3 `exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence` discharges it with a hand
`fin_cases q` over the 6 joins; at general `d` the dispatch must be written as a
**uniform** argument over the `Fin (d+1)`-pair index (two cases on whether `0` is
in the omitted pair), not `fin_cases`. This is a writing obligation (a `Fin`-
indexed reindex of the d=3 builders), not a math one — if it surfaces a genuine
gap at build, *that* would be the place an alg-independence/geometric fact could
sneak back in, so the CHAIN-4 builder must confirm the membership closes from the
orthogonality hyps alone. **Pinned, not pre-committed away:** the verdict is
"existence route; the only new work is the homogeneous-incidence re-statement,"
with this one build-time confirmation flagged.

### (j) CHAIN-4 remainder decomposition — buildable leaves with exact signatures

**Status:** CHAIN-4 detailed-build recon, docs-only, 2026-06-18 (companion to the
OD-4 verdict §(i)). CHAIN-4's two mechanical bricks landed 2026-06-18
(`exists_independent_perp_pair_gen`, `omitTwoExtensor_eq_extensor_kept_gen`); this
decomposes the **remainder** into buildable leaves with exact `Fin (k+2)`/`Fin
(d+1)` signatures, dependency-ordered. Convention (matching §(f) and the all-`k`
engine): phrase `k`-parametrically with `k = d − 1`, ambient `Fin (k+2) =
Fin (d+1)`, the `d` chain normals `n : Fin (k+1) → Fin (k+2) → ℝ` (at d=3, `k=2`:
`Fin 3 → Fin 4`), the `d+1` homogeneous witness vectors `pbar : Fin (k+2) →
Fin (k+2) → ℝ`. Each leaf keeps the `Fin 4`/d=3 lemma as a `k:=2` wrapper (zero
d=3 regression). The leaves below feed CHAIN-5's dispatch (§C.3).

**Leaf CHAIN-4a — `exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals` at `Fin (k+1) →
Fin (k+2)` (the OD-4 sub-leaf; clean lift, no residual openness).**
```
theorem exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals_gen {k : ℕ}
    {n : Fin (k + 1) → Fin (k + 2) → ℝ} (hn : LinearIndependent ℝ n) :
    ∃ pbar : Fin (k + 2) → Fin (k + 2) → ℝ, LinearIndependent ℝ pbar ∧
      (∀ u, pbar 0 ⬝ᵥ n u = 0) ∧
      (∀ i : Fin (k + 1),
        (∀ j, j ≠ i → pbar i.succ ⬝ᵥ n j = 0) ∧ pbar i.succ ⬝ᵥ n i ≠ 0)
```
*Mechanism (verbatim lift of the d=3 body, lines 427–504).* The `(k+1) × (k+2)`
row matrix `A = of n` has LI rows (`hn`), so `A.rank = k+1 = finrank ℝ^{k+1}`
(`LinearIndependent.rank_matrix`); `A.mulVecLin` is surjective onto `ℝ^{k+1}`
(`Submodule.eq_top_of_finrank_eq`); preimages of the `k+1` standard targets
`e_i : Fin (k+1) → ℝ` give `pbar (i+1) ⊥ n j` for `j≠i` and `≠ 0` against `n i`;
`pbar 0` is the nonzero common-perp of all `k+1` normals (`exists_ne_zero_
dotProduct_eq_zero` at `m = k+1 < k+2`, **already general**, line 119). LI of
`pbar` is the triangular argument: pairing `∑ gᵢ • pbar i = 0` against `n u`
isolates `g (u+1)`, then `g 0 • pbar 0 = 0` with `pbar 0 ≠ 0`. **Clean lift** —
the only d=3-specific tactics are `Fin.sum_univ_four`/`fin_cases`, which become
`Fin.sum_univ_succ`/`Finset.sum_eq_single`-style over `Fin (k+2)`. **No residual
openness** (this is the OD-4 §(i) verdict made concrete: existence/linear, no
genericity device). The `Fin 4` `exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals` becomes
the `k:=2` wrapper (a `Fin 3`-vs-`Fin (k+1)` reindex + the `∀ i, …` unpacked to
the three explicit `hb1/hb2/hb3` conjuncts).

**Leaf CHAIN-4b — `exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence` at `Fin (k+2)`
(clean lift; carries the §(i) residual flag).**
```
theorem exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen {k : ℕ}

    {pbar : Fin (k + 2) → Fin (k + 2) → ℝ}
    (h0 : ∀ u, pbar 0 ⬝ᵥ n u = 0)
    (hi : ∀ i : Fin (k + 1), ∀ j, j ≠ i → pbar i.succ ⬝ᵥ n j = 0) :
    ∀ q : {q : Fin (k + 2) × Fin (k + 2) // q.1 < q.2},
      ∃ (u : Fin (k + 1)) (n' : Fin (k + 2) → ℝ)
        (p : Fin k → Fin (k + 2) → ℝ),
        LinearIndependent ℝ ![n u, n'] ∧ LinearIndependent ℝ p ∧

        omitTwoExtensor pbar (ne_of_lt q.2) = extensor p
```
*Mechanism.* The `d=3` builders `htwo`/`hone` generalize via the §(i) join↔panel
combinatorics: for omitted pair `q = {a,b}`, the kept points are the `k = d−1`
increasing-complement indices (`omitTwoExtensor_eq_extensor_kept_gen`, **LANDED**),
and the line lies in `Πᵢ` iff `i+1 ∈ {a,b}`. Two cases on `0 ∈ {a,b}`: if `0 ∉
{a,b}` the line lies in the **two** panels `Π_{a−1},Π_{b−1}` (take `n' = n (b−1)`,
both kept points ⊥ both normals — the `htwo` analog); if `0 ∈ {a,b}` it lies in
the **single** panel `Π_{b−1}` (take `n'` from the landed
`exists_independent_perp_pair_gen` on the `d−1 = k` kept points, needs `2 ≤ k`
i.e. `d ≥ 3` — the `hone` analog). **Carries the §(i) residual flag:** the d=3
body discharges the per-join dispatch by `fin_cases q` over 6 joins; the general
form must be a **uniform** two-case argument over the `Fin (k+2)`-pair, and the
"kept points ⊥ the shared normal(s)" step must close from `h0`/`hi`
(orthogonality) + the kept-index complement membership alone. **This is the one
leaf whose build must confirm the §(i) combinatorial claim** (the place a hidden
geometric/alg-independence need would surface if §(i) is wrong). Note the points
arity is now `Fin k` (the `k = d−1` points spanning the line), matching CHAIN-3's
`extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet` point family `p : Fin k`.

**Leaf CHAIN-4c — `case_III_claim612` at `ScrewSpace (d−1)`/`Fin (d+1)` (clean
lift; the D-span existential).**
```
theorem case_III_claim612_gen {k : ℕ} {r : Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)} (hr : r ≠ 0)
    {pbar : Fin (k + 2) → Fin (k + 2) → ℝ} (hp : LinearIndependent ℝ pbar) :
    ∃ q : {q : Fin (k + 2) × Fin (k + 2) // q.1 < q.2},
      r ⟨omitTwoExtensor pbar (ne_of_lt q.2), extensor_mem_exteriorPower _⟩ ≠ 0
```
*Mechanism (verbatim lift of the d=3 body, lines 1064–1079).* Contrapositive:
if `r` annihilated every one of the `D` joins it would annihilate their span
`= ⊤` (the **already-general** `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top hp` (23a Leaf 2) via
Lemma 2.1) hence be `0` (`eq_zero_of_annihilates_span_top`, **already general**,
line 100). **Pure numeral lift — both bricks are already `{k:ℕ}`; this is the
cleanest CHAIN-4 leaf.** No residual openness. (This is the §(i) D-span finish:
it needs only LI of `pbar`, no affine independence.)

**Leaf CHAIN-4d — `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence` at
`ScrewSpace (d−1)`/`Fin d` candidates (the discriminator; consumes CHAIN-3 (h-4)).**
```
theorem exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen {k : ℕ}

          ⟨extensor ![n u, n'], extensor_mem_exteriorPower _⟩) ≠ 0
```
*Mechanism.* Combine CHAIN-4c's witness join (`r(join q)≠0`) with CHAIN-4b's
per-join line data (the panel `n u`, second normal `n'`, the `k` kept points `p`
with `omitTwoExtensor pbar = extensor p`); the per-line **join=meet duality**
`extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet` (**CHAIN-3 (h-4), LANDED**, the
`k`-form) transfers `r(extensor p) = r(join q) ≠ 0` to `r(complementIso⟨extensor
![n u,n'],_⟩) ≠ 0` (the contrapositive of the d=3
`extensor_join_eq_zero_of_complementIso_eq_zero_dotProduct`). **Note the
discriminator's `complementIso` is `(j := 2)`, NOT `(j := d−1)`** — the §(f)/§(i)
correction: a line has exactly 2 normals at every `d`, so the panel-meet is the
meet of 2 hyperplanes (input grade 2, output grade `k`). The prior §(a)-table
entry "`complementIso(k:=d−1)(j:=d−1)`" is wrong; it is `(j:=2)`. **Residual
openness: none beyond CHAIN-4b's flag** — this leaf is the assembly of 4b+4c+(h-4),
all of whose pieces are landed or clean lifts. The `Fin 3` discriminator becomes
the `k:=2` wrapper; the d=3 `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence`
re-points at this general lemma's `k:=2` instance (or stays the green d=3 body —
a CHAIN-4-internal call, h-5 territory, not forced).

**Dependency order:** CHAIN-4a (independent) → CHAIN-4b (consumes 4a's incidence +
landed `omitTwoExtensor_eq_extensor_kept_gen` + `exists_independent_perp_pair_gen`)
→ CHAIN-4c (independent; consumes only the landed general N1) → CHAIN-4d (consumes
4b + 4c + the landed CHAIN-3 (h-4) duality). 4a and 4c are buildable now in
parallel (both clean lifts); 4b carries the one §(i) residual confirmation; 4d is
the capstone. **First buildable OD-4 leaf = CHAIN-4a** (the OD-4 verdict made
concrete; no dependency on un-landed work).

## CHAIN↔ENTRY chain-data contract

**Status:** settled 2026-06-17 (docs-only design-settle pass, source-verified
against KT §6.4.2 eqs. 6.46–6.67 read end-to-end + the landed `d=3` producer/
consumer/dispatch in tree). This section freezes the **shared interface** the
recon's flag (b) (§"CHAIN"(b)) left open: the length-`d` chain-data shape that
the ENTRY extractor produces and the CHAIN-5 dispatch consumes. **Authoritative
for the interface only** — it does NOT build any leaf, does NOT decide OD-4 (the
eq.-6.67 alg-independence route), and does NOT mint ENTRY. Every CHAIN leaf and
the ENTRY extractor is to be authored against the frozen shape below.

### C.0 — Where the chain data actually flows (the producer reshape, verified)

The recon's flag (b) located the carried `hdispatch` shape, but the
**load-bearing structural fact for the contract is one level deeper**: the chain
*extraction* does **not** live in a separate ENTRY lemma feeding the dispatch —
it lives **inside the producer** `case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k`
(`CaseIII/Arms.lean:777`). Verified in tree (Arms.lean:828–857, the `|V(G)| ≥ 4`
arm): the producer (i) calls `Graph.exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`
(`Reduction.lean:383`) to get the 4-tuple `v,a,b,c` + edges, (ii) picks a fresh
`e₀`, (iii) proves `G.splitOff v a b e₀` is a smaller minimal-0-dof graph + is
simple, (iv) pulls its **generic** realization `hsplitGP` from the IH's GP
conjunct, and (v) feeds all of that to `hcand`. So the **producer is the chain
extractor's only consumer**, and the `hcand`/`hdispatch` premise bundle is the
*output type of the extractor* re-expressed as the *input type of the dispatch*.

**Consequence for the contract.** The reshape is **three decls changing in
lockstep, all carrying the identical premise bundle** (verified byte-identical
across the three):
1. `Graph.exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` (`Reduction.lean:383`) — the **producer
   side** (ENTRY): its `∃`-output tuple is the record.
2. `case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k.hcand` (`Arms.lean:797–807`) **and** the
   identical extraction-arm body (Arms.lean:828–857) — the **producer** threads
   the record into `hcand`.
3. `case_III_realization_all_k.hdispatch` (`Realization.lean:699–709`) and
   `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k_all_k.hdispatch` (`Theorem55.lean:2230–2240`,
   wrapped under a per-`G` `∀`) — the **consumer side** (CHAIN-5): the carried
   crux hypothesis whose shape must be the record.

The `d=3` premise bundle, verbatim (the four files agree):
```
(v a b c : α) (eₐ e_b e_c e₀ : β)
v ∈ V(G) → a ∈ V(G) → b ∈ V(G) → c ∈ V(G) →

### C.1 — The length-`d` chain-data record (item 1)

KT §6.4.2 (eqs. 6.46–6.59, p. 692–694) needs the **whole chain `v₀v₁…v_d`** with
`d_G(vᵢ)=2` for `1≤i≤d−1`, the base framework on `G₁ = splitOff at v₁` (KT's
`G^{v₀v₂}_{v₁}`), and the redundant-`(v₀v₂)` row of Claim 6.11. The recommended
shape is a **`structure`** (not an anonymous `∃`-tuple — at `d=3` the tuple is
already 17 fields; at general `d` the vertex/edge sequences are `Fin`-indexed
families and an anonymous tuple is unmaintainable). Grounded field-by-field in
the KT chain definition + the landed `splitOff` API (`Operations.lean:579`,
`splitOff_isLink` 619):

```
/-- Length-`d` Case-III chain data (KT §6.4.2, the chain v₀v₁…v_d). -/
structure ChainData (G : Graph α β) (n : ℕ) where
  d        : ℕ                         -- the chain length = the body-bar dim index (d = k+1)
  hd       : 1 ≤ d                     -- nondegenerate chain (d ≥ 1; d=3 ⟹ 2)
  vtx      : Fin (d + 1) → α           -- v₀ … v_d  (KT 6.46: the chain vertices)
  edge     : Fin d → β                 -- the chain edges: edge i = vᵢvᵢ₊₁
  e₀       : β                         -- the fresh short-circuit label for the v₁-split (6.46)
  -- KT chain conditions:
  vtx_mem    : ∀ i, vtx i ∈ V(G)
  vtx_inj    : Function.Injective vtx                       -- the vᵢ are distinct (6.67 affine-indep prep)
  link       : ∀ i : Fin d, G.IsLink (edge i) (vtx i.castSucc) (vtx i.succ)
  edge_inj   : Function.Injective edge
  deg_two    : ∀ i : Fin d, 1 ≤ (i : ℕ) → (i : ℕ) ≤ d - 1 → -- d_G(vᵢ)=2 for 1≤i≤d−1 (6.46):
                 (∀ e x, G.IsLink e (vtx i.castSucc?) x →    -- every vᵢ-edge is edge(i−1) or edge(i)
                   e = edge (prev i) ∨ e = edge i)            -- (the degree-2 closure, KT's two-edge fact)
  e₀_fresh   : e₀ ∉ E(G)
```
(The `deg_two` field is sketched against the `splitOff_isLink` two-edge-closure
pattern the `d=3` `hclv`/`hcla` carry; the exact `Fin`-arithmetic of "the two
edges incident to `vᵢ` are `edge (i−1)` and `edge i`" is a build detail for
ENTRY — the *content* is "interior chain vertices have degree exactly two, with
their two edges being the two chain edges at that index", which is precisely
KT's `d_G(vᵢ)=2`.) **The base framework `(G₁,q₁)` is NOT a record field** — it is
produced *inside* the dispatch from the IH (as the `d=3` producer does at
Arms.lean:854, pulling `hsplitGP` from `(hIH …).1`); the record carries only the
*combinatorial* chain. The `splitOff` that builds `G₁` is `G.splitOff v₁ v₀ v₂ e₀`
(splice the `v₀v₂` edge, delete `v₁`), matching the landed `splitOff v a b e₀`
with `(v,a,b) = (v₁,v₀,v₂)` — see C.4.

**Carried minimality / conditioned-IH hypotheses** stay *outside* the record, on
the producer/dispatch signature exactly as the `d=3` bundle has them: `hG :
G.IsMinimalKDof n 0`, `hnoRigid`, `hSimple`, the IH conjunction `hIH`, and the
per-split `(G.splitOff …).deficiency n = 0`. The record is the *chain witness*;
the realization/minimality data is the surrounding induction context (this
matches the `d=3` split: `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` returns only the
combinatorial tuple, and `case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k` supplies `hG`/`hIH`/
`hsplitGP` from its own context).

### C.2 — Producer-side signature (item 2): the reshaped extractor

ENTRY reshapes `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` from the fixed 4-tuple to a
`ChainData` producer. Target signature (general `d`, against the record):
```
theorem Graph.exists_chainData_of_noRigid [DecidableEq β] [Finite α] [Finite β]
    {G : Graph α β} {n : ℕ}
    (hD : (some-D-floor) ≤ bodyBarDim n)        -- ENTRY lifts the d=3 `6 ≤ bodyBarDim n` floor
    (hV : (d + 1) ≤ V(G).ncard)                 -- enough vertices for a length-d chain
    (hG : G.IsMinimalKDof n 0)
    (hnp : ∀ H : Graph α β, ¬ H.IsProperRigidSubgraph G n) :
    G.ChainData n                                -- the record (or the cycle-branch disjunct, OD-1)
```
This is KT **Lemma 4.6 (chain) + Lemma 4.8 (split-off minimality)** at general
`d` — the "new combinatorial leaf for ENTRY" the OD-2/OD-3 verdict named (not
subsumed in Phase-20, which produces only the single degree-2 split). The
`d=3` `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` becomes the `d=3` instance / a wrapper that
fills `ChainData` with `d = 3` and `(vtx 0,1,2,3) = (b,v,a,c)` (C.4). **The
hD floor is ENTRY's to lift** (the `6 ≤ bodyBarDim n` of the `d=3` extractor is
the `d=3` regime; the general floor is the body-bar-dim ↔ chain-length relation,
a separate ENTRY obligation — see §"CHAIN"(d), `hD`-floor lift).

### C.3 — Consumer-side signature (item 3): the CHAIN-5 dispatch

CHAIN-5's dispatch (`hdispatch`/`hcand`) takes the record + the surrounding
induction context and produces the realization. Target shape:
```
(hdispatch : ∀ (cd : G.ChainData n),
    (G.splitOff (cd.vtx 1) (cd.vtx 0) (cd.vtx 2) cd.e₀).deficiency n = 0 →
    HasGenericFullRankRealization k n
        (G.splitOff (cd.vtx 1) (cd.vtx 0) (cd.vtx 2) cd.e₀) →   -- the base (G₁,q₁) seed
    HasGenericFullRankRealization k n G)
```
i.e. *"given the length-`d` chain, the deficiency-0 fact on `G₁ = splitOff at v₁`,
and the IH-generic base realization on `G₁`, build the `d` candidate frameworks
(CHAIN-2, eqs. 6.47/6.48/6.57/6.59), apply the `⋀^{d−1}`-duality discriminator
(CHAIN-3/4, eq. 6.67) to find a full-rank `Mᵢ`, and close via the (already
general-`k`) arm closer for that `i`."* The `G₁` here is `splitOff (vtx 1) (vtx
0) (vtx 2) e₀` — the `v₁`-split splicing `v₀v₂` — which is the *single* split the
`d=3` bundle's `(G.splitOff v a b e₀)` already names (C.4). The remaining `d−2`
candidate splits `Gᵢ = splitOff at vᵢ` (KT 6.54–6.56) are built *internally* by
the dispatch from `cd` and the isos `ρᵢ` (which are *derived* from the chain by
eq. 6.54, not carried — see C.5). **CHAIN-5's signature is frozen as this shape**
(per the (b) co-design gate); the only build-time latitude is the exact `Fin`
arithmetic of indexing `cd.vtx`/`cd.edge`.

### C.4 — The `d=3` specialization (item 4): zero-regression wrapper

At `d=3` the chain `v₀v₁v₂v₃` **is** `b—v—a—c` (verified against the `d=3`
extractor `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`, which returns `v,a,b,c` with `v`,`a`
the adjacent degree-2 pair via `eₐ`, `b` the other `v`-neighbour, `c` the other
`a`-neighbour). The record-to-tuple map:

| Record (`ChainData`, general `d`) | `d=3` value | `d=3` tuple field |
|---|---|---|
| `d` | `3` (= `k+1` at `k=2`) | — |
| `vtx 0` | `b` | `b` (the `v₀` endpoint) |
| `vtx 1` | `v` | `v` (interior, deg 2) |
| `vtx 2` | `a` | `a` (interior, deg 2 in `G₁`) |
| `vtx 3` | `c` | `c` (the `v₃` endpoint) |
| `edge 0` (= `v₀v₁` = `bv`) | `e_b` | `e_b` |
| `edge 1` (= `v₁v₂` = `va`) | `eₐ` | `eₐ` (the shared edge) |
| `edge 2` (= `v₂v₃` = `ac`) | `e_c` | `e_c` |
| `e₀` | `e₀` | `e₀` |

So **`G₁ = splitOff (vtx 1) (vtx 0) (vtx 2) e₀ = splitOff v b a e₀`** — but the
landed `d=3` bundle uses `splitOff v a b e₀` (note `a`,`b` swapped). `splitOff`
is symmetric in its `a,b` arguments (verified: `splitOff_isLink`,
`Operations.lean:619`, makes `v₀v₂` and `v₂v₀` the same `e₀`-link via the
`(x=a∧y=b) ∨ (x=b∧y=a)` disjunct), so `splitOff v a b e₀ = splitOff v b a e₀` as
graphs — the `d=3` wrapper instantiates cleanly either way. The degree-2 closures
`hclv` (every `v`-edge is `eₐ` or `e_b`) and `hcla` (every `a`-edge is `eₐ` or
`e_c`) are exactly `ChainData.deg_two` at `i=1` (vtx 1 = v: edges `edge 0 = e_b`,
`edge 1 = eₐ`) and `i=2` (vtx 2 = a: edges `edge 1 = eₐ`, `edge 2 = e_c`). **The
`d=3` line stays a zero-regression wrapper**: `exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`
(the existing 4-tuple lemma) becomes the `d=3` `ChainData` constructor, and the
`theorem_55_d3`/`case_III_realization` wrappers fill `hdispatch` from the
existing `case_III_candidate_dispatch` via this map — no `d=3` proof changes,
only an adapter from the 4-tuple to the `ChainData` projection.

### C.5 — OD-1 reconciliation (item 5): the chain/cycle division of labor

KT p. 692: *"By Lemma 4.6, either `G` is a cycle of length at most `d` or `G`
has a chain of length `d`. If `G` is a cycle of length at most `d`, then we are
done by Lemma 5.4."* So the **dichotomy is upstream of the dispatch**. Pinned
division of labor:

- **The extractor (ENTRY) owns the dichotomy.** `exists_chainData_of_noRigid`
  (C.2) is where Lemma 4.6 fires. It has two honest shapes, and **OD-1 chooses
  between them at ENTRY-build, not now** — the contract is written so CHAIN-5
  works under **either**:
  1. *Extractor returns the chain only, ENTRY discharges the cycle branch
     separately* (preferred if Lemma 5.4 can be folded into the base/short-cycle
     case the way the `d=3` triangle floor was, §"23a"-OD verdict that `d=3`
     dodged 5.4). Then `exists_chainData_of_noRigid : G.ChainData n` returns a
     genuine chain, and CHAIN-5 **assumes the chain branch** — the cycle case
     never reaches the dispatch. **This is the contract's default assumption**:
     CHAIN-5's `hdispatch` consumes a `ChainData` and is *not* responsible for
     the cycle branch.
  2. *Extractor returns a disjunction* `G.ChainData n ⊕ (G is a short cycle,
     |V| ≤ D)`, and the producer routes the cycle disjunct to a **Lemma 5.4
     short-cycle realization** brick (a genuine new ENTRY leaf, risk #4, the
     Crapo–Whiteley cycle realization). CHAIN-5 still only sees `ChainData`.
- **CHAIN never handles the cycle branch.** Under both shapes, CHAIN-5's input
  is a `ChainData`; the cycle realization (if load-bearing) is ENTRY's. This is
  the safe pin: it does not pre-commit OD-1 (whether 5.4 is needed at all), and
  it keeps the dispatch signature stable regardless of how the dichotomy
  resolves. **ENTRY decides at build** whether the cycle branch is vacuous /
  base-folded (shape 1) or needs the 5.4 brick (shape 2); the dispatch contract
  is invariant under that choice.

### C.6 — Clause (ii): no motive/IH-level change forced by the interface

Pinning the contract did **not** surface a motive/IH-level blocker. The chain
data is purely combinatorial (`ChainData` carries no realization, no nested-IH
seed); the base framework `(G₁,q₁)` is supplied to the dispatch as the
**existing** `HasGenericFullRankRealization k n (G.splitOff …)` premise (the
`d=3` `hsplitGP` shape, already general-`k` from 23a), pulled from the *same*
0-dof IH conjunct the `d=3` producer uses (Arms.lean:854). The `d`-candidate
splits `Gᵢ` are *smaller* minimal-0-dof graphs realized by the same IH at the
same dof — **no higher-dof `G_v` GAP-6 pattern, no conditioned-pair data the
0-dof motive cannot supply**. The one genuine open question the interface
*touches* but does **not** resolve is **OD-4** (the eq.-6.67 `d+1`-points step:
existence route vs. the alg-independence hammer) — that is a CHAIN-4 *internal*
build decision, not an interface field, and the contract is invariant under it
(the record carries the chain; OD-4 concerns how the dispatch *uses* the
generic base `(G₁,q₁)`, whose `AlgebraicIndependent ℚ` data the 23a-lifted
`case_III_nested_rank_lower` already consumes). **The interface is frozen; the
two honest unknowns it routes downstream are OD-1 (ENTRY's dichotomy shape, C.5)
and OD-4 (CHAIN-4's alg-independence route), both build-time, neither a motive
change.**
