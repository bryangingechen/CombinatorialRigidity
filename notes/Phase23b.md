# Phase 23b — general-`d` Case-III chain dispatch + `⋀^{d−1}` duality [CHAIN] (work log)

**Status:** open. **CHAIN-1 + CHAIN-3 + CHAIN-4 are CLOSED, and OD-7 (the four-producer tail) is
CLOSED** — all four 23a-carried producers (`hbase_k`/`hcut_k`/`hcontract_k`/`hforget_k`) + both M4
halves are general-`k`. The last OD-7 leaf, **`case_I_dispatch_gen` + the `hcontract_k` wire-up**,
**landed 2026-06-18** (a verbatim numeral pass over the d=3 `case_I_dispatch` `by_cases` plumbing,
feeding the three already-landed `_gen` producers; plus `case_I_hcontract_gen`, the general-`k` filler
for the carried `hcontract_k` slot, lifting the d=3 wrapper's `c=0`/`c>0` split — the d=3
`case_I_dispatch` is now its `k:=2` wrapper and `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k`'s inline `hcontract_k`
filler is `case_I_hcontract_gen (k:=2)`, blueprint pins unmoved). **Remaining: CHAIN-2 + CHAIN-5.**
**CHAIN-4 was closed by the CHAIN-4d commit**
(`exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen`, the discriminator capstone = assembly of
CHAIN-4c + CHAIN-4b + CHAIN-3 (h-4)). CHAIN-1 = the
`ιc`-block candidate augment + `…candidateBlock_swap`
(`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`), graph-free over `ScrewSpace k`. CHAIN-3 = the general-`d` per-line
join=meet duality `extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet` (`MeetHodge.lean`), the
`⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line route (the d=3 `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` stays the GREEN d=3
wrapper). **CHAIN-5 gated by the ENTRY-contract reshape.** The integer Phase 23 stays **in progress**
— ENTRY / ASSEMBLY remain (coordinator owns the sub-phase boundary; codes-until-open).

**Orientation.** This is the **23b (CHAIN layer)** sub-phase work log — the
*rolling* state + hand-off for the active layer only. The cross-phase
**plan/guidance** (sub-phase division, sequence, open decisions, sources) is the
canonical job of `notes/Phase23-design.md`; the **detailed leaf-level recon of
CHAIN** is its §"CHAIN — detailed leaf-level recon" ((a) per-file reach-ins, (c)
buildable-leaf sequence, (d) green-modulo boundary, (e) OD resolutions). The
program map is `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`. **Sub-phase naming convention:**
the layers are tracked by stable **codes** — `CARRIER`(=23a, closed), `CHAIN`(=
this 23b), `ENTRY`, `ASSEMBLY`; a letter + work log is minted when a layer
opens, so a later split costs no renumber-churn. `23b` is the minted letter for
CHAIN; ENTRY/ASSEMBLY stay code-only until their turn.

## Current state

**Next = CHAIN-2c-ii-graphiso — the graph-level `splitOff_isLink` iff** (the `hiso` supplier; full
signature + proof-shape caveat in *Hand-off* below + design §(o′)(A)). Both cycle halves are now
landed — `ChainData.shiftPerm` (ρ, vertex side, 2c-ii-α) and **`ChainData.shiftEdgePerm` (σ, edge
side, LANDED 2026-06-19)** — so the remaining work is the graph-level iff itself (a `Fin i`-cycle of
edge/vertex case moves, genuinely longer than the d=3 single-swap `splitOff_isLink_relabel`),
route-independent (prerequisite for both §(o′)(B) arm-closer routes).

**`shiftEdgePerm` (the σ, LANDED).** `List.formPerm` on the edge cycle `[edge 0, e₀, edge i, edge 1,
…, edge (i−1)]` (graph-free, `[DecidableEq β]`), with four action lemmas: `…apply_edge_zero`
(`edge 0 ↦ e₀`), `…apply_e₀` (`e₀ ↦ edge i`), `…apply_edge_interior` (`edge j ↦ edge (j+1)`,
`1 ≤ j`, `j+1 < i`), `…apply_edge_off` (fixes labels off `{e₀, edge 0, …, edge i}`). The two "closure"
edges `edge (i−1)`, `edge i` complete the cycle but never appear as candidate-split links (both at the
deleted `vᵢ`), so the brick won't need their action values. Same `formPerm ∘ ofFn` idiom as `shiftPerm`.
Axiom-clean.

**§(o′) FLAGS a genuine route-A/B fork in the arm-closer transport** (NOT settled by 2c-ii-β; §(o)'s
"M₃'s body" framing was wrong — the landed M₃ uses W9a/W9b/G4d-i row-span transport, not
`ofNormals_relabel`). Full statement + resolution in *Hand-off* (canonical) + design §(o′).

**Route β — LOCKED** (user-adjudicated 2026-06-18, KT-source-verified row 242): KT builds the `d`
candidates as index-shift re-views of ONE `v₁`-base; build 2c off the single base + the uniform
`Fin (k+1)` relabel arm. The §(o′) architectural fork (route A vs. B for the arm-closer *transport*)
is **within** route β — it does not re-open the locked single-base route. The **blueprint-clarity
obligation** (route β absorbs KT's isos 6.54–6.56 + the ±r chain 6.66, so the `lem:case-III`
general-`d` prose must materialize them): *Hand-off* + design §(n)/§(o)/§(o′).

**Context (closed/landed):** CHAIN-1/3/4 + OD-7 CLOSED; `G.ChainData n` record + 7 accessors landed;
**CHAIN-2a CLOSED**; **CHAIN-2c-i** + **2c-ii-α** + **2c-ii-β** + **2c-ii-graphiso edge half
(`shiftEdgePerm`)** landed. Remaining in CHAIN-2c: **2c-ii** — decomposed (§(o′)) into
**2c-ii-graphiso** (the `shiftPerm`/`shiftEdgePerm`-relabel `splitOff_isLink` brick; both cycle halves
now landed, the graph-level iff itself is next) → **2c-ii-transport** (route A's eq.-(6.66) functional
identity *or* route B's cycle W9a/W9b, adjudicated at contact) → **2c-ii-arm** (`chainData_relabel_arm`)
— then **2c-iii** (`chainData_dispatch` assembly) → **CHAIN-5** (signature frozen by the CHAIN↔ENTRY
contract) + the ENTRY extractor reshape.

**Architectural constraint (standing).** The metric-using Hodge leaves live in `MeetHodge.lean`, never
`Meet.lean`: importing `Mathlib.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.PiL2` into the metric-free `Meet.lean`
regresses `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` to a `whnf` timeout (TACTICS-QUIRKS § 59). Pure
`EuclideanSpace`↔`toDual` glue stays in the `Mathlib/` mirror; (h-4) also belongs in `MeetHodge.lean`.

**CHAIN orientation (standing).** The arm-realization engine is already general-`k`; the only
genuinely-`d=3` surface was the dispatch (`case_III_candidate_dispatch`) + its `⋀²ℝ⁴` discriminator —
CHAIN replaces it with the `d`-candidate chain dispatch + the `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})` duality finish (LANDED).
Full source-verified orientation: design §"CHAIN".

**The load-bearing flag (recon (b)) — SETTLED 2026-06-17.** The CHAIN↔ENTRY chain-data contract is
**frozen** (design §"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract"): `G.ChainData n` is the shared shape, reshaped via three
lockstep decls (ENTRY extractor / producer `…hcand` / CHAIN-5 `hdispatch`); no motive/IH change (C.6);
CHAIN-5's signature authorable, the `d=3` line a zero-regression wrapper (C.4).

## CHAIN leaf checklist

The buildable-leaf sequence (exact signatures + dependency order in
`notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN"(c)/(l)/(m)/(n)/(o)/(o′)). **CHAIN-1 + CHAIN-3 + CHAIN-4 + OD-7 +
CHAIN-2a are CLOSED; CHAIN-2c-i + 2c-ii-α + 2c-ii-β are LANDED.** Remaining: **CHAIN-2c-ii** — §(o′)
decomposed it into **2c-ii-graphiso** (the `shiftPerm`-relabel `splitOff_isLink` brick, next) →
**2c-ii-transport** (route A or B, adjudicated at contact) → **2c-ii-arm** (the closer) — then
**CHAIN-2c-iii** (assembly), and **CHAIN-5** (signature frozen by the CHAIN↔ENTRY contract; gated on
the rest of CHAIN-2 + ENTRY's extractor reshape).

      route β). Sub-leaves: **CHAIN-2c-i** (`exists_chainData_discriminator_pick`, the panel-LI + the
      one-shot discriminator pick — **LANDED 2026-06-18**, axiom-clean) → **CHAIN-2c-ii** (the uniform
      `Fin d` relabel arm = the genuinely-new crux; **§(o)/§(o′) resolved the route flag: a
      genuinely-new construction, NOT a numeral pass** — KT's `ρᵢ` is a `(i−1)`-cycle, the

      fact + the IH-generic base realization on that split. Keep the `d=3` dispatch

## Blockers / open questions

The OD resolutions (full text in `notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN"(e)/(g)):

- **OD-8 — RESOLVED 2026-06-17.** The panel-meet range-membership
  `complementIso(j:=2)⟨n_u∧n',_⟩ ∈ range(⋀^k W ↪)` for `W = {n_u,n'}^⊥` is CLOSED via route α
  (the entire leaf chain h-0…h-3 LANDED): `complementIso` IS the Hodge `⋆`, O(n)-natural; the
  target transports the standard-frame membership along an orthogonal change of frame. Route β
  stays **rejected** (the annihilation→membership upgrade is the withdrawn `dim Φ̃` count
  `= C(d−1,2) > 1` for `d≥4`). Full text `notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN"(h); landed leaf in
  *Decisions made* below.
- **OD-6 — DECIDED: five leaves within ONE sub-phase 23b** (no separate duality
  letter). The arm-realization engine they feed is already general-`k`, so
  neither hard core stands alone as a deliverable. Split at contact only if
  CHAIN-2's index bookkeeping proves larger than estimated.
- **OD-7 — DECIDED: the four 23a-carried producers fold into CHAIN's tail**
  (after CHAIN-3), not a dedicated successor — the M4-forget reach-in *is*
  CHAIN-3's duality, and the conditioned-pair producers route through M4.
  Caveat: confirm at build that the duality is their *only* `d=3` reach-in.
- **OD-4 — RESOLVED 2026-06-18 (design-pass): existence/homogeneous route,
  alg-independence NOT forced.** Verdict + reasoning: Decisions-made below +
  `notes/Phase23-design.md` §(i). KT eq. (6.67) phrases the `d+1`-points step via
  alg-independence (p. 698 verbatim, confirmed against the `.refs/` PDF), but the
  landed d=3 formalization sidesteps it: the D-span runs off the already-general
  `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` (only hyp `LinearIndependent ℝ pbar`, via Lemma
  2.1), driven by **linear** independence of `d+1` **homogeneous** vectors, not
  KT's affine points / `(d−j)`-flat fact. The row #106 cross-product construction
  is **dead (zero live call sites)**. CHAIN-4 lifts as a numeral generalization of
  green bricks; one build-time residual (per-join panel-membership, CHAIN-4b).
- **(b) producer-shape mismatch — SETTLED 2026-06-17** (the docs-only
  contract-settle pass). The CHAIN↔ENTRY interface is frozen in
  `notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract": a `G.ChainData n` `structure`
  (length-`d` chain `vtx : Fin (d+1) → α`, `edge : Fin d → β`, `e₀`, the deg-2
  closures) is the shared shape. **No motive/IH change forced** (C.6): the chain
  data is purely combinatorial, the base `(G₁,q₁)` is the existing general-`k`
  `HasGenericFullRankRealization` premise pulled from the same 0-dof IH conjunct,
  the `d` candidate splits are smaller 0-dof graphs (no higher-dof `G_v` GAP-6).
  The reshape is **three decls in lockstep** (extractor / producer-`hcand` /
  dispatch-`hdispatch`); the `d=3` line is a zero-regression wrapper (C.4 map:
  chain `v₀v₁v₂v₃ = b—v—a—c`). CHAIN-5's signature is now authorable.
- **OD-1 (re-confirmed for CHAIN/ENTRY).** KT Lemma 5.4 short-cycle base is a
  real branch of the general-`d` chain entry (unlike `d=3`'s inline triangle
  floor); whether CHAIN's dispatch assumes the chain branch (ENTRY discharging
  the cycle branch) is an ENTRY-contract question.

## Hand-off / next phase

**Edge half of CHAIN-2c-ii-graphiso landed 2026-06-19 (`ChainData.shiftEdgePerm`); the graph-level
`splitOff_isLink` iff itself is next.** CLOSED/LANDED so far (full detail in *Current state* +
*Decisions made* + the checklist): CHAIN-1/3/4 + OD-7 + CHAIN-2a CLOSED; CHAIN-2c-i
(`exists_chainData_discriminator_pick`) + 2c-ii-α (`ChainData.shiftPerm`) + 2c-ii-β
(`ofNormals_relabel_perm`) + the 2c-ii-graphiso **edge cycle** (`ChainData.shiftEdgePerm` + 4 action
lemmas) LANDED, all axiom-clean.

**Next = CHAIN-2c-ii-graphiso — the graph-level `splitOff_isLink` iff** (the `hiso` supplier;
`notes/Phase23-design.md` §(o′)(A) pins the signature). Both cycle halves are now landed —
`cd.shiftPerm i.castSucc` (ρ, vertex side, 2c-ii-α) and `cd.shiftEdgePerm i` (σ, edge side, just
landed) — so the remaining work is the iff `(G.splitOff (vtx i.castSucc)(vtx i.succ)(vtx
(i−1).castSucc) cd.e₀).IsLink e x y ↔ (G.splitOff (vtx 1)(vtx 2)(vtx 0) cd.e₀).IsLink (σ e) (ρ x)
(ρ y)` (source = the `v₁`-base = 2a-ii's `i=1` split, landed arg order; target = the candidate-`i`
interior split, same fresh `cd.e₀`; `splitOff` is `a,b`-symmetric). Hypotheses mirror
`splitOff_isLink_relabel`'s, read off the landed `ChainData` accessors (chain links, `vtx_inj`/
`edge_inj`/`pred_edge_ne`, interior `deg_two_split` at each cycle index, `e₀_fresh`). Graph-side
(`Operations.lean`, beside `splitOff_isLink_relabel`), route-independent — **the prerequisite for BOTH
arm-closer routes**, so it lands before the §(o′)(B) fork. Its proof is genuinely longer than the d=3
single-swap version (a `Fin i`-cycle of edge/vertex case moves, possibly by induction on cycle length
or a careful `splitOff_isLink` expansion driven by the `shiftEdgePerm`/`shiftPerm` action lemmas); the
*signature* is fixed.

**Then the §(o′)(B) architectural fork (FLAGGED — surface to the coordinator).** §(o′) corrected §(o)'s
"`Fin d` generalization of M₃'s body" framing: the landed M₃ does **not** route through
`ofNormals_relabel` (it keeps the shared `ρ₀`/`w`, transports row-memberships via **W9a/W9b/G4d-i**,
`Relabel.lean:546`/`653`/`813`), and 2c-ii-β is a *different* mechanism. So the arm-closer transport
has a genuine fork, **each route with its own genuinely-new piece** (2c-ii-β landing does NOT settle
it): **route A** (2c-ii-β → 2a-ii on the relabel-transported split) needs the eq.-(6.66) identity
`ρᵢ = shiftPerm`-image-of-`ρ₀` — a W6b-*functional* transport 2c-ii-β doesn't supply, since 2a-ii runs
its own W6b producing candidate `i`'s own `ρᵢ` (`Realization.lean:1006`); **route B** (M₃-style shared
`ρ₀`) needs the cycle-generalization of W9a/W9b, hard-wired to a single degree-2 transposition (the
a-column-subtraction trick, `Relabel.lean:592`–626). **Adjudicate A-vs-B at the build of the graph-iso
brick → the transport.** **No motive/IH or spine-carried-hypothesis change** on either route —
infrastructure below the dispatch (C.6/C.3 unmoved); route β (single base) stays LOCKED, the fork is
within it. Then **2c-ii-arm** (`chainData_relabel_arm`) → **CHAIN-2c-iii** (`chainData_dispatch`
assembly, unchanged by the route choice — it consumes the closer's `HasGenericFullRankRealization k n G`)
→ **CHAIN-5**.

- **CHAIN-2c — the single-base `Fin (k+1)` family dispatch (design §(n)/§(o)/§(o′)).** Route β LOCKED
  (user-adjudicated 2026-06-18, KT-source-verified): ONE base `(G₁,q₁)` (the `v₁`-split = `M₀`), ONE
  `ρ₀`, ONE W6b call, ONE discriminator call, then `fin_cases u`; eq. (6.66)'s ±r chain absorbed into
  reusing one `ρ₀`. The relabel arm (2c-ii) covers the interior candidates `2 ≤ i ≤ d−1` (a
  genuinely-new construction, NOT a numeral pass — KT's `ρᵢ` is a `(i−1)`-cycle, the d=3 engines are
  transposition-only); **M₀-arm reuse SETTLED:** 2a-ii (`chainData_split_realization`) is the `i=1`/`M₀`
  arm (its per-`i` split at `i=1` IS the `v₁`-split), the uniform arm does not subsume it (they are the
  `fin_cases`'s direct / relabel legs). The 2c-ii leaf decomposition + the §(o′)(B) route-A-vs-B fork
  are in the *Hand-off* lead above (canonical) + design §(o′). No motive/IH or spine-carry change. The
  `G.ChainData n` record + 7 accessors (C.1) are landed; ENTRY owns the extractor (C.2).

  **Blueprint-clarity obligation (owner-flagged 2026-06-18 — "absolutely clear").** Route β **absorbs**
  KT's explicit index-shift isos (6.54–6.56) + ±r chain (6.66) into the Lean `shiftPerm` relabel arm —
  so the `lem:case-III` general-`d` node's prose MUST materialize them explicitly (§(o)/§(o′) pin the
  four ordered points): (1) the single-`v₁`-base construction; (2) the index-shift iso `ρᵢ` (the
  `(i−1)`-cycle) and "exactly the same framework" via it; (3) the single redundancy `r` (eq. 6.52)
  carried ±-ly across the `d` panels (eq. 6.66) — the §(o′)(B) route-A eq.-(6.66) identity / route-B
  degree-2 mechanism is exactly this step; (4) the (6.67) discriminator (Lemma 2.1 on the `d+1`
  points). The Lean economizes; the exposition must not. Tracked in BlueprintExposition (the
  `lem:case-III` general-`d` entry, extending the d=3 `lem:case-III-claim612-eq644`); written as
  2c-ii/CHAIN-5 land + at phase-close.

Re-pointing the d=3 discriminator `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence` at CHAIN-4d's
`k:=2` instance (h-5) is now an available but **not-forced** simplification — the d=3 body + its
`complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` wrapper stay green meanwhile; defer to ASSEMBLY/cleanup. **The
OD-8 route β stays rejected** (the annihilation→membership upgrade is the withdrawn `dim Φ̃` count —
distinct from the CHAIN-2c "route β" just locked above; this is the CHAIN-3/OD-8 duality route). The CHAIN-3-finish
geometry (the `⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line route, NOT the withdrawn d=3-only `Φ̃` route) lives canonically in
`notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN"(f)/(h); the join=meet duality KT leaves implicit is captured in the
BlueprintExposition ledger (the CHAIN-3 entry).

**The CHAIN↔ENTRY contract is now settled** (`notes/Phase23-design.md`
§"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract", 2026-06-17) — the (b) build-recon gate is discharged:
CHAIN-5's `hdispatch`/`hcand` signature is frozen against the `G.ChainData n`
record (C.1/C.3), so it is now authorable. **CHAIN-2's *linear algebra* is independent
of the contract, but its *indexing* is contract-coupled** (recon §(l) overturned the
old "CHAIN-2 fully independent" claim): the `ChainData` record it indexes **is now authored
in Lean** (`Induction/Operations.lean`, 2026-06-18, the zeroth leaf — `deg_two` settled), so
the indexing prereq is discharged. CHAIN-5 is unblocked once the rest of CHAIN-2 lands
**and** ENTRY's extractor is reshaped.

**ENTRY obligation — PINNED (signature frozen; minted/built when its turn
comes).** ENTRY reshapes `Graph.exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` (`Reduction.lean:383`)
from the fixed `v,a,b,c` 4-tuple to the `G.ChainData n` producer
`exists_chainData_of_noRigid` (contract C.2 — KT Lemma 4.6 chain + Lemma 4.8
split-off minimality at general `d`, the "new combinatorial leaf" of the
OD-2/OD-3 verdict), and lifts the `6 ≤ bodyBarDim n` floor to the general
chain-length floor. The chain/cycle dichotomy (OD-1, KT Lemma 4.6 / Lemma 5.4)
is **ENTRY's to resolve at build** (contract C.5): the dispatch always consumes
a `ChainData` and never sees the cycle branch, so ENTRY's choice between
"chain-only extractor + cycle folded into base" (default) vs. "disjunction +
Lemma 5.4 short-cycle realization brick" is invariant for CHAIN-5's signature.
**The producer `case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k` (`Arms.lean:777`) is the chain
extractor's only consumer** (it calls the extractor inline at the `|V|≥4` arm,
Arms.lean:828–857) — its `hcand` slot is the third lockstep decl (C.0).

**Green-modulo boundary CHAIN hands downstream** (`notes/Phase23-design.md`
§"CHAIN"(d)): CHAIN discharges the general-`k` `hdispatch` (now against the frozen
`ChainData` contract) and lifts the four producers (OD-7). **ASSEMBLY** composes
the honest general-`d` Theorem 5.5, re-greens `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` +
`hub`, derives Thm 5.6, states Conjecture 1.2.

## Decisions made during this phase

(Phase-local choices land here as CHAIN leaves build. The opening recon's
decisions — OD-6/OD-7 resolved, OD-4 + (b) flagged — live in
`notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN"(e); the chain-data contract lives in its
§"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract".)

### Phase-local choices and proof techniques

Settled entries are one-line verdicts (decision + Lean name); proof techniques live
in git + `notes/FRICTION.md` + the design doc §"CHAIN"(f)/(g)/(h) + §"CHAIN↔ENTRY
contract". The forward detail (route to close the open leaves) is in *Current state*
/ *Hand-off* above.

**Recons / design decisions (detail in `notes/Phase23-design.md`):**
- **Opened on a leaf-level recon, not a build** — found the arm-engine already
  general-`k`, only the dispatch `d=3`; surfaced flag (b) → §"CHAIN"(a)–(e).
- **CHAIN↔ENTRY chain-data contract settled** — `G.ChainData n` structure +
  producer/`hdispatch` signatures; no motive/IH change forced (clause ii) →
  §"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract" C.0–C.6.
- **CHAIN-3-finish recon: the `⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line route, NOT the d=3 `Φ̃` route**
  (a line has **2** normals at every `d`, **d−1** points); `finrank_sup_range_wedgeFixedLeft`
  / `extensor_toDual_extensor_eq_zero_of_perp` **withdrawn** (dead d=3-only, kept green
  as the d=3 wrapper) → §"CHAIN"(f). KT-route-checked (the join=meet duality KT leaves
  implicit) → §"CHAIN"(f) *Coordinator KT-route check*.
- **OD-8 RESOLVED: route α (`complementIso` O(n)-equivariance); β rejected** — the whole
  leaf chain h-0…h-3 landed, the panel-meet range-membership is closed. `complementIso` IS the
  Hodge `⋆`; β rests on the withdrawn `dim Φ̃` count → §"CHAIN"(h).
- **OD-4 RESOLVED 2026-06-18: existence/homogeneous route, alg-independence NOT forced**
  (overturns the prior "forced" lean). The landed d=3 N3a works homogeneously (§1.42 R1-affine):
  the eq.-(6.67) D-span runs off `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` (already general-`k`, only hyp
  `LinearIndependent ℝ pbar`, via Lemma 2.1) — **linear** independence of `d+1` **homogeneous**
  vectors, never KT's affine points / `(d−j)`-flat-in-union (the alg-independence consequence is on
  the route the formalization sidesteps). Source-verified: KT p.698 verbatim (`.refs/` PDF) vs. the
  landed bodies; the row #106 cross-product construction is **dead (zero live call sites)**. No new
  `AlgebraicIndependent` lemma; site (b) is not a site (only site (a), nested seed-rank, stays live).
  Per-join panel-membership generalizes combinatorially (join `{a,b}`⊂`Πᵢ` iff `i+1∈{a,b}`). One
  build residual flagged (CHAIN-4b). CHAIN-4 decomposed into 4a–4d → §"CHAIN"(i)/(j).
- **CHAIN-2 decomposition (recon 2026-06-18, read-only Plan + coordinator source-verify) — overturns
  §(c)'s framing.** The named `caseIIICandidate`/`case_III_old_new_blocks`/`case_III_rank_certification`
  chain is **already general-`k`** (the only `d=3`-pin in `CaseIII/` is `Realization.lean`'s dispatch =
  CHAIN-5); §(c)'s "(now `q : α × Fin 4`-shaped)" was false. CHAIN-2 = the `Fin d`-indexed reduction
  *layer* (2a per-`i` / 2b ±r-chain / 2c family) on top of that chain + closed CHAIN-1 →
  §"CHAIN"(l).
- **CHAIN-2a design-pass (2026-06-18) — VERDICT: re-index, gates threaded from above** (settles the
  session-#7 open question against the landed bodies). CHAIN-2a's per-`i` reduction is a
  `case_III_arm_realization` (general-`k`) re-index, NOT a from-scratch gate construction: the gate
  family is carried as hypotheses by both the certification (`Candidate.lean:1403`) and the arm closer
  (`Arms.lean:72`), and supplied from above by two general-`k` producers (W6b
  `exists_candidateRow_bottomRows_of_rigidOn` + CHAIN-4d discriminator, fed by
  `case_III_nested_rank_lower_all_k`). Sub-leaves: CHAIN-2a-i `chainData_split_arm_gates` (the two
  producer calls) → CHAIN-2a-ii `chainData_split_realization` (the arm-closer re-index). One
  build-time wiring flag (arm form + `h622lb`/`hIH` instantiation), no motive change → §"CHAIN"(m).
- **CHAIN-2a CLOSED 2026-06-18 — the complete single-`i` reduction (re-index verdict CONFIRMED).**
  Two axiom-clean leaves in `CaseIII/Realization.lean`: `chainData_split_w6b_gates` (the W6b half — a
  `{k}`-general flat-tuple lift of the d=3 dispatch's W6b region: one
  `exists_candidateRow_bottomRows_of_rigidOn` call fed `h622lb`, producing the chain-order
  `hρe₀`/`hρGv`/`hw`/`hwmem` bundle; flat-tuple so it is reusable AND callable at `k=2`) and
  `chainData_split_realization` (the re-index core — reads the per-`i` split tuple off the `ChainData`
  accessors, produces `h622lb` from `case_III_nested_rank_lower_all_k`, consumes the W6b bundle, builds
  the `ends₁`-override congruence, calls `case_III_arm_realization`). The §(m) clause-(ii) flag resolved
  to `case_III_arm_realization` directly (no `_M3` relabel — chain `v—a`/`v—b` matches the arm closer's
  `(v,a,b)` roles). **The transversal half stays a hypothesis `htrans`** (single-`i` slot CHAIN-2c
  fills via the discriminator, whose arbitrary panel `u`↔candidate `i` match is the family glue). No
  FRICTION (verbatim d=3-dispatch template re-use over the accessors; the `Fin d`-index `.symm`s and
  the `Gv.Loopless` `haveI` are landed idioms).
- **CHAIN-2b/2c design-pass (2026-06-18) — VERDICT: single-base `Fin (k+1)` dispatch (route β), ±r
  chain absorbed (no separate 2b lemma).** Single base `(G₁,q₁)` / one `ρ₀` / one discriminator /
  `fin_cases u`; reuse 2a-ii only at `M₀`. Route β LOCKED (user-adjudicated, row 242). Detail
  `notes/Phase23-design.md` §(n).
- **CHAIN-2c-ii design-pass (2026-06-18, two passes §(o) then §(o′)) — VERDICT (clause ii): the
  uniform `Fin d` relabel arm is a genuinely-new construction, NOT a numeral pass** (KT's `ρᵢ` is a
  cycle, the d=3 engines transposition-only). §(o) decomposed 2c-ii-α (`shiftPerm`, LANDED) → 2c-ii-β
  (general-perm framework-transport, LANDED) → arm closer → 2c-iii; M₀-arm (2a-ii) reused at `i=1`
  only; no motive/IH/spine-carry change. **§(o′) (the post-landing pass) corrected §(o)'s "`Fin d`
  generalization of M₃'s body" framing** — the landed M₃ does NOT use `ofNormals_relabel` (it keeps
  the shared `ρ₀`/`w`, transports via W9a/W9b/G4d-i), so 2c-ii-β is a *different* mechanism. The arm
  closer thus has a FLAGGED route fork: route A (2c-ii-β → 2a-ii) needs the eq.-(6.66) `ρᵢ =
  shiftPerm`-image-of-`ρ₀` functional identity; route B (M₃-style) needs cycle-generalized W9a/W9b.
  The `shiftPerm`-relabel `splitOff_isLink` brick (the `hiso` supplier, signature pinned §(o′)(A)) is
  route-independent and builds first. Detail §"CHAIN"(o)/(o′).
- **CHAIN-2c-i LANDED 2026-06-18 — the single-discriminator pick (steps 1–3, route β):**
  `exists_chainData_discriminator_pick` (`CaseIII/Realization.lean`, axiom-clean) — the `Fin (k+1)`-panel
  LI feeds the one CHAIN-4d discriminator call → `(u, n')`; verbatim generalization of the green d=3
  discriminator region (`case_III_candidate_dispatch` 435–442), `u` arbitrary. Detail in git + §(o).
- **CHAIN-2c-ii-α LANDED 2026-06-18 — `ChainData.shiftPerm` (KT eq. 6.54)**, the vertex `i`-cycle
  `vtx 1 → ⋯ → vtx i → vtx 1` + action lemmas (`Induction/Operations.lean`, axiom-clean; `formPerm ∘
  ofFn` idiom in FRICTION). Git + §(o).
- **CHAIN-2c-ii-graphiso edge half LANDED 2026-06-19 — `ChainData.shiftEdgePerm` (the `σ`)**, the
  edge-side `i`-cycle `edge 0 → e₀ → edge i → edge 1 → ⋯ → edge (i−1) → edge 0`
  (`Induction/Operations.lean`, axiom-clean), the partner of `shiftPerm` the graph-iso brick's `σ`
  slot wants. `List.formPerm` on a `head :: head :: head :: ofFn` cycle list, `[DecidableEq β]`-only;
  4 action lemmas (`apply_edge_zero`/`apply_e₀`/`apply_edge_interior`/`apply_edge_off`). The closure
  edges `edge (i−1)`/`edge i` are never candidate-split links (both at the deleted `vᵢ`), so their
  action values are unneeded. Same `formPerm ∘ ofFn` idiom as 2c-ii-α (FRICTION entry extended with the
  edge-side `0 < i` length / omega-`i.isLt` / defeq index-shift sub-lessons; no new entry).
- **CHAIN-2c-ii-β LANDED 2026-06-18 — `ofNormals_relabel_perm`**, the involution-free general-`Equiv.Perm`
  framework-transport (`CaseIII/Relabel.lean`, axiom-clean): graph layer abstracted to
  `hiso : Gt.IsLink e x y ↔ Gs.IsLink (σ e) (ρ x) (ρ y)` + `hρst` (the forced `ρ.symm`/`σ.symm`
  placement in FRICTION). Git + §(o)/§(o′).
- **`G.ChainData n` record LANDED 2026-06-18 (CHAIN-2 zeroth leaf)** — the contract-C.1 length-`d`
  chain `structure` in `Induction/Operations.lean` (the `splitOff` home): fields `d`/`hd`/`vtx :
  Fin (d+1)→α`/`edge : Fin d→β`/`e₀` + `vtx_mem`/`vtx_inj`/`link`/`edge_inj`/`deg_two`/`e₀_fresh`,
  plus accessors `ChainData.pred_edge_ne`/`isLink_edge`. **`deg_two` settled:** interior vertices
  guarded by `0 < (i:ℕ)` (no `OfNat (Fin d)` literal — the `0`/`1` `Fin d` literals fail to synth at
  general `d`), predecessor edge as `edge ⟨(i:ℕ)-1, _⟩`; d=3-map (C.4) verified by `rfl`/`decide`
  (`vtx 1=v`, `vtx 2=a`; closures `edge 0=e_b`, `edge 1=eₐ`, `edge 2=e_c`). `n` is a phantom index
  (no field uses it) carried only so the contract can write `G.ChainData n`. Axiom-clean; no FRICTION.
- **`ChainData` interior-split geometry accessors LANDED 2026-06-18 (CHAIN-2 zeroth leaf, part 2)** —
  five `ChainData.{pred_succ_eq_castSucc, isLink_pred_edge, isLink_succ_edge, succ_ne_pred_castSucc,
  deg_two_split}` lemmas (`Induction/Operations.lean`) exposing, for an interior index `i` (`0 < (i:ℕ)`),
  the per-`i` `(v,a,b,e_a,e_b)` split tuple `case_III_rank_certification` consumes: split body
  `vtx i.castSucc`; the two chain edges `edge i` / `edge ⟨(i:ℕ)-1,_⟩` oriented *out of* it (the
  predecessor via `pred_succ_eq_castSucc` — `(⟨(i:ℕ)-1,_⟩).succ = i.castSucc` — then `.symm`); distinct
  neighbors `vtx i.succ ≠ vtx (⟨(i:ℕ)-1,_⟩).castSucc`; and the degree-2 closure re-oriented (`Or.symm`
  of the field). Same `0 < (i:ℕ)` + `congrArg Fin.val`/`omega` idiom as `pred_edge_ne`. Axiom-clean; no
  FRICTION (the `Fin.coe_castSucc → val_castSucc` deprecation was a one-name swap).
- **OD-7 `hcontract_k` decomposition (recon 2026-06-18, read-only Plan + coordinator source-verify):**
  5 leaves (6 if h65 splits) — `all_k`/`nonsimple`/`h65`/`dispatch` numeral passes (one `_perp_grade`
  swap; `_all_k` is all-*dof* not all-grade, a trap), the *one* genuinely-new piece LEAF-0
  `linearIndependent_normals_of_algebraicIndependent_triple` (fixed-3-row LI at `Fin (k+2)`; landed
  `…_general` gives `k+1` rows, h65 has only 3 vertices). No motive/IH change → §"CHAIN"(k).

**Landed CHAIN-3 bricks** (the `_grade` lifts are verbatim — the route is general mathlib, grade
enters nothing; `d=3` names kept as `(d:=3)` instances, no blueprint pin moved). CHAIN-3 is CLOSED;
construction internals live in git + `notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN"(f)/(h) + the
BlueprintExposition CHAIN-3 entry (the duality KT leaves implicit,
`extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet`). The two forward cleanup-candidates are the `[~]`
sub-bullet under the *CHAIN leaf checklist* CHAIN-3 entry.

**Landed OD-7 (four-producer tail) bricks** (OD-7 CLOSED 2026-06-18; per-brick names + the `hcontract_k`
five-leaf split + construction internals live in git + commit messages + `notes/Phase23-design.md`
§(k), the canonical home; all axiom-clean).
All four producers + both M4 halves are now general-`k` via verbatim numeral passes over the d=3 bodies
(`screwDim/ScrewSpace 2→k`, `Fin 4→Fin (k+2)`, dof `k→c`; d=3 lemmas now `k:=2` wrappers/instances,
blueprint pins unmoved, §58 idiom). Two settled cross-cutting notes: the *one* genuinely-new piece was
LEAF-0 `linearIndependent_normals_of_algebraicIndependent_triple` (fixed-3-row LI, **not** a numeral
pass — the landed `…_general` gives `k+1` rows, h65 has only 3 vertices); the M4-forget reach-in routes
solely through the CHAIN-3 (h-4) duality + the new slot-0 rescale `extensor_update_smul` (confirming
caveat (e): the duality *is* the only M4-forget d=3 reach-in).

**Landed CHAIN-4 bricks** (CHAIN-4 CLOSED 2026-06-18, `RigidityMatrix/Claim612.lean`; leaf names + per-leaf
verdicts + construction internals live in git + `notes/Phase23-design.md` §(i)/(j), the canonical home;
all axiom-clean). Two settled cross-cutting notes:
4d's `MeetHodge` import did NOT regress the file's `⋀²ℝ⁴` proofs to a §59 whnf timeout; 4b has two faithful
divergences from the d=3 body (off-one-panel hyp + `LinearIndependent ℝ p` conclusion via the new `hpbar`),
so the d=3 lemma stays its own green body, not a `k:=2` wrapper.

**Landed CHAIN-1 bricks** (CHAIN-1 CLOSED 2026-06-18, `RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`, graph-free over
`ScrewSpace k`, axiom-clean; both single-`Unit` predecessors re-derived as `ιc := Unit` corollaries,
blueprint pins unmoved): the eq.-6.62 row-correspondence swap `linearIndependent_sumElim_candidateBlock_swap`
(+ mirror `…_block_swap`) and the `ιc`-block candidate augment `linearIndependent_sum_pinned_block_augment_block`
(+ `…_augment_candidateRow_block`). The per-candidate column-op heterogeneity (each `i` its own `Φᵢ`) is
**CHAIN-2's** bookkeeping (augment fires one body at a time).

### Promoted to TACTICS-GOLF / TACTICS-QUIRKS / FRICTION / DESIGN

- *A finite-`i`-cycle permutation over an indexed family `vtx : Fin n → α` as `Equiv.Perm α`:
  `List.formPerm (List.ofFn …)` (needs `[DecidableEq α]`); `Nodup` via `nodup_ofFn`, action lemmas
  via `formPerm_apply_lt_getElem` / `…_getElem` + `Nat.mod_self` / `…_of_notMem`* → FRICTION [idiom]
  *A `Fin n → α` indexed-family cycle as an `Equiv.Perm`…*.
- *Dropping the involution from a `ρ = Equiv.swap`-relabel transport to a general `Equiv.Perm ρ`: the
  `ρ`/`ρ.symm` placement is forced — `qρ` keeps forward `ρ`, but `endsσρ` + the rigidity-pullback
  motion `S∘ρ.symm` flip to `.symm`; the vertex-region transport stays forward `ρ`* → FRICTION
  [idiom] *Dropping the involution from a `ρ = Equiv.swap`-relabel transport…*.
- *`rw [hidx]` on a `getElem` index `l[k]`/`l[k]'h` (the bounds proof depends on `k`) trips "motive
  is not type correct" — re-apply the indexing lemma at the new index, don't rewrite the index in
  place* → TACTICS-QUIRKS § 61.
- *`Fin d`-index arithmetic at general `d` (no `+1`): a `0 < i` guard / `i - 1` predecessor wants
  `OfNat (Fin d)` literals that don't synth — for plain index bookkeeping (not a `d=0`-false slot),
  guard `0 < (i:ℕ)` + build `⟨(i:ℕ)-1, _⟩` rather than carry `[NeZero d]`* → FRICTION [idiom]
  *`Fin d`-index arithmetic (general `d`): guard `0 < (i:ℕ)`…*.
- *Lifting a `Fin (k+2)`-point-family lemma to general `k` may need `[NeZero k]` (the `0 : Fin k`
  literal in a slot-`0` rescale; the statement is genuinely false at `k=0`) — carry the hypothesis,
  don't fight the `OfNat (Fin k) 0` synthesis* → FRICTION [idiom] *Lifting a `Fin (k+2)`-point-family
  lemma to general `k`…*.
- *`map_update_smul` on `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti` at general grade: `(M := Fin (d+1) → ℝ)` annotation +
  the `have … := …map_update_smul v i c (v i)` term form (not `rw`, which leaves `Module ℝ …`
  un-synthesized) + `Function.update_eq_self` to clear the `update v i (v i)` residual* → FRICTION
  [idiom] *`ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti ℝ n` needs `(M := ...)`…* (Phase 23b reuse).
- *The `⧸` quotient notation (`M ⧸ P`) needs a direct `import Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Quotient.Basic`
  even when `Submodule.mkQ` resolves by name (a notation must be imported, not merely reachable) —
  or drop the type ascription and let `set π := P.mkQ` infer the codomain* → TACTICS-QUIRKS § 60 /
  FRICTION [mirrored] *`linearIndependent_sumElim_block_swap`…* (Gotcha).
- *To use the mirrored `Finset.univ_orderEmbOfFin` on a `powersetCard` `default` index,
  surface `↑default = univ` with a `rfl`-`have` first (it won't `simp` out on its own)*
  → FRICTION [idiom] *To use the mirrored `Finset.univ_orderEmbOfFin` on a `powersetCard`…*.
- *A `-/` inside a docstring word (`grade-/ambient`) closes the doc comment early
  → "unexpected identifier; expected 'lemma'" inside the prose* → TACTICS-QUIRKS § 57.
- *After lifting an in-place numeral-pinned `def` to implicit `{d}`, a numeral
  consumer's `omega` mis-atomizes the `(d:=3)`-vs-numeral elaborations of one term
  (free-variable counterexample, never reads the bridging hyp) — use `linarith` /
  `simpa using h`* → TACTICS-QUIRKS § 58 / FRICTION [idiom] *Generalizing an in-place
  numeral-pinned `def`…*.
- *`Set.powersetCard.compl` inside a hypothesis (no expected `powersetCard _ m` type)
  leaves the target cardinality `m` a stuck metavariable — pin `(m := …)` explicitly*
  → FRICTION [idiom] *`Set.powersetCard.compl` inside a hypothesis…*.
- *`set b := e` folds `e` out of the goal too, so a later `rw`/`simp only [lib_lemma]`
  whose LHS pattern mentions `e` silently fails (`simp only` reports args "unused") —
  the goal-side / library-lemma variant of the `set` fold; drop the `set`* →
  TACTICS-QUIRKS § 43 (goal-side / library-lemma variant).
- *A new `InnerProductSpace`/`EuclideanSpace` import poisons a pre-existing exterior-algebra proof
  in the same file to a `whnf` timeout (the `PiLp 2` instances become defeq-visible to `⋀`-term
  elaboration) — keep the bridge in a `Mathlib/` mirror, house metric-using leaves in a downstream
  file* → TACTICS-QUIRKS § 59 / FRICTION [mirrored] *`EuclideanSpace.inner_eq_basisFun_toDual`…*.
- *`induction h using Submodule.span_induction` fails on an applied membership subject (`n j`) —
  hoist a `∀ y ∈ span, …` helper, induct on the bound `y`* → FRICTION [idiom] *`induction h using
  Submodule.span_induction` fails …*.
- *`EuclideanSpace.equiv` is a `ContinuousLinearEquiv`, not a `LinearEquiv` — round-trips need the
  `ContinuousLinearEquiv.*` forms (a `LinearEquiv.apply_symm_apply` `simp only` no-ops)* → FRICTION
  [idiom] *`EuclideanSpace.equiv` is a `ContinuousLinearEquiv`…*.
- *Re-orienting a proportionality `c • x = y` into `c⁻¹ • y = x` — use `inv_smul_eq_iff₀ hcne` on the
  goal, not `rw [← hc, smul_smul]` (the nested-`•` `rw` chain fails on `⋀`-subtype elements)* →
  TACTICS-GOLF § 19.
- *Recovering a permuted-incidence `Fin n` wrapper from a general `_gen` lemma — feed `_gen` the
  reordered indexed family (`n ∘ ![…]`, LI via `hn.comp _ (by decide)`) and read the pairings back
  through the (definitional) reorder, rather than re-proving the d=3 body* → FRICTION [idiom]
  *Recovering a permuted-incidence `Fin n` wrapper…*.
- *Pushing a functional through `c • x` on an `abbrev`'d carrier (`ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k …`): `rw
  [map_smul]` (even a concrete `rw [hsmul]`) mis-fires on the smul instance — close with `exact
  (r.map_smul c _).trans …`* → TACTICS-GOLF § 19 (companion) / FRICTION [idiom] *Pushing a functional
  through a `c • x` on an `abbrev`'d carrier…*.
