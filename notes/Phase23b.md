# Phase 23b — general-`d` Case-III chain dispatch + `⋀^{d−1}` duality [CHAIN] (work log)

**Status:** open. **CHAIN-1 + CHAIN-3 + CHAIN-4 are CLOSED, and OD-7 (the four-producer tail) is
CLOSED** — all four 23a-carried producers (`hbase_k`/`hcut_k`/`hcontract_k`/`hforget_k`) + both M4
halves are general-`k`. The last OD-7 leaf, **`case_I_dispatch_gen` + the `hcontract_k` wire-up**,
**landed 2026-06-18** (a verbatim numeral pass over the d=3 `case_I_dispatch` `by_cases` plumbing,
feeding the three already-landed `_gen` producers; plus `case_I_hcontract_gen`, the general-`k` filler
for the carried `hcontract_k` slot, lifting the d=3 wrapper's `c=0`/`c>0` split — the d=3
`case_I_dispatch` is now its `k:=2` wrapper and `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k`'s inline `hcontract_k`
filler is `case_I_hcontract_gen (k:=2)`, blueprint pins unmoved). **Remaining: CHAIN-2 + CHAIN-5.**
**CHAIN-4 was closed by the CHAIN-4d commit**
(`exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen`, the discriminator capstone = assembly of
CHAIN-4c + CHAIN-4b + CHAIN-3 (h-4)). CHAIN-1 = the
`ιc`-block candidate augment + `…candidateBlock_swap`
(`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`), graph-free over `ScrewSpace k`. CHAIN-3 = the general-`d` per-line
join=meet duality `extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet` (`MeetHodge.lean`), the
`⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line route (the d=3 `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` stays the GREEN d=3
wrapper). **CHAIN-5 gated by the ENTRY-contract reshape.** The integer Phase 23 stays **in progress**
— ENTRY / ASSEMBLY remain (coordinator owns the sub-phase boundary; codes-until-open).

**Orientation.** This is the **23b (CHAIN layer)** sub-phase work log — the
*rolling* state + hand-off for the active layer only. The cross-phase
**plan/guidance** (sub-phase division, sequence, open decisions, sources) is the
canonical job of `notes/Phase23-design.md`; the **detailed leaf-level recon of
CHAIN** is its §"CHAIN — detailed leaf-level recon" ((a) per-file reach-ins, (c)
buildable-leaf sequence, (d) green-modulo boundary, (e) OD resolutions). The
program map is `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`. **Sub-phase naming convention:**
the layers are tracked by stable **codes** — `CARRIER`(=23a, closed), `CHAIN`(=
this 23b), `ENTRY`, `ASSEMBLY`; a letter + work log is minted when a layer
opens, so a later split costs no renumber-churn. `23b` is the minted letter for
CHAIN; ENTRY/ASSEMBLY stay code-only until their turn.

## Current state

**Next = CHAIN-2c-i — the single-discriminator pick** (`chainData_dispatch` steps 1–3: the `d`-panel-
normal LI producer `hpanelLI` + the one-shot discriminator call off the shared `ρ₀`). Design
`notes/Phase23-design.md` §(n), the CHAIN-2b/2c design-pass (source-verified against KT eqs. 6.46–6.67
+ the landed bodies). **CHAIN-2a (the per-candidate single-`i` reduction) is CLOSED** — both leaves
landed 2026-06-18: `chainData_split_w6b_gates` (W6b half) + `chainData_split_realization` (the per-`i`
`case_III_arm_realization` re-index off the `ChainData` accessors, transversal half carried as
`htrans`).

**The §(n) design-pass found a load-bearing structural correction to the §(l)/§(m) framing of 2b/2c
(clause ii flag).** KT Lemma 6.13 (and the landed `d=3` dispatch `case_III_candidate_dispatch`) build
the `d` candidates from **ONE** base realization `(G₁,q₁)` (the `v₁`-split = `M₀`), with **ONE** `ρ₀`,
**ONE** W6b call, **ONE** discriminator call, then `fin_cases u : Fin 3` over the *panels* — the other
candidates are role-relabels (`_M2` sign-swap, `_M3` `swap a v`), NOT fresh splits. So **eq. (6.66)
(the ±r chain) is absorbed into the reuse of a single `ρ₀` across candidate roles, not a separate
lemma.** The landed `chainData_split_realization` is instead parameterized by a **per-`i` split** with
a **per-`i` `htrans`** — a correct standalone per-candidate lemma + the `M₀`-arm, but **NOT the shape
the family disjunction assembles** (the discriminator's single `r = ρ₀` is the `v₁` functional, not
candidate `u`'s per-split `ρ`). **Route β — LOCKED (user-adjudicated 2026-06-18, KT-source-verified row 242):** build CHAIN-2c as the `Fin (k+1)`-case
generalization of the d=3 dispatch off the single `v₁`/`M₀` base (reusing the landed W6b +
discriminator), reusing 2a-ii only at the `M₀` candidate; the genuinely-new crux is the **uniform
`Fin d` relabel arm** (the eq.-6.54 iso transport of `ρ₀` to an arbitrary candidate `u`'s role —
CHAIN-2c-ii, where the build adjudicates route α vs β). Then **CHAIN-5/ENTRY**.

**Context (closed/landed — full detail in the Status banner + checklist + Hand-off + *Decisions
made*):** CHAIN-1/3/4 + OD-7 (all four 23a producers `hbase_k`/`hcut_k`/`hcontract_k`/`hforget_k` +
both M4 halves general-`k`) CLOSED; the `G.ChainData n` record + the 7 interior-split accessors landed,
so the per-`i` `(v,a,b,e_a,e_b)` split tuple is reachable directly from `cd : G.ChainData n`.
Remaining: **CHAIN-2** (2a-ii → 2b → 2c) + **CHAIN-5** (signature frozen by the CHAIN↔ENTRY contract;
gated on the rest of CHAIN-2 + ENTRY's extractor reshape).

**CHAIN-1/3/4 — all CLOSED** (2026-06-17/18; per-leaf detail in *Decisions made* → *Landed
CHAIN-{1,3,4} bricks* + `notes/Phase23-design.md` §(f)/(h)/(i)/(j) + git):
- **CHAIN-3** = the general-`d` per-line join=meet duality `extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet`
  (`MeetHodge.lean`, the `⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line route; OD-8 leaf chain h-0…h-4); the d=3
  `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` stays the GREEN d=3 wrapper.
- **CHAIN-1** = the `ιc`-block candidate augment + the eq.-6.62 row-correspondence swap
  (`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`, graph-free over `ScrewSpace k`).
- **CHAIN-4** = the Claim-6.12 discriminator capstone
  `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen` (`Claim612.lean`, assembling
  CHAIN-4c+4b+CHAIN-3 (h-4); **OD-4 held end-to-end** — only LI of `pbar`, no alg-independence).
- Forward: **CHAIN-2** consumes CHAIN-1; **CHAIN-5** consumes CHAIN-3/4 (gated on CHAIN-2 + ENTRY).

**Architectural constraint (standing).** The metric-using Hodge leaves live in `MeetHodge.lean`, never
`Meet.lean`: importing `Mathlib.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.PiL2` into the metric-free `Meet.lean`
regresses `complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` to a `whnf` timeout (TACTICS-QUIRKS § 59). Pure
`EuclideanSpace`↔`toDual` glue stays in the `Mathlib/` mirror; (h-4) also belongs in `MeetHodge.lean`.

**CHAIN orientation (standing).** The recon (`notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN", source-verified
against KT §6.4.2 eqs. 6.46–6.67 + the landed tree) found **the arm-realization engine is already
general-`k`** (the M₁/M₂/M₃ closers `case_III_arm_realization` / `_M2` / `_M3` in
`CaseIII/{Arms,Relabel}.lean` were authored `(k:ℕ)`); the genuinely-`d=3` surface is **only the
dispatch** (`case_III_candidate_dispatch`, `Realization.lean:201`) — its fixed-3-candidate count +
the `⋀²ℝ⁴` discriminator (`exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals` / `…complementIso…` in
`Claim612.lean`, the `Meet.lean`/`MeetHodge.lean` duality lemmas). CHAIN's job: replace that
dispatch with the `d`-candidate chain dispatch + the `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})` duality finish (now LANDED).

**The load-bearing flag (recon (b)) — SETTLED 2026-06-17.** The 23a-carried
`hdispatch` (`Theorem55.lean:2225`) takes a **fixed `v,a,b,c` 4-tuple**, faithful
at `d=3` (the chain `v₀v₁v₂v₃` *is* `b—v—a—c`) but **too short at `d≥4`** — KT's
general-`d` Lemma 6.13 needs the whole length-`d` chain. The CHAIN↔ENTRY
chain-data contract is now **frozen** (`notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN↔ENTRY
contract"): a `G.ChainData n` `structure` (length-`d` chain `vtx`/`edge`/`e₀` +
degree-2 closures) is the shared shape; the reshape is **three decls in
lockstep** — the ENTRY extractor (`exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` → a `ChainData`
producer), the producer `case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k.hcand` (which calls the
extractor inline, C.0), and the CHAIN-5 dispatch `hdispatch`. **No motive/IH
change forced** (clause (ii), C.6): the chain data is combinatorial, the base
`(G₁,q₁)` stays the existing general-`k` realization premise from the same 0-dof
IH conjunct, the `d` candidate splits are smaller 0-dof graphs. CHAIN-5's
signature is now authorable; the `d=3` line is a zero-regression wrapper (C.4).

## CHAIN leaf checklist

The buildable-leaf sequence (exact signatures + dependency order in
`notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN"(c)/(l)/(m)). **CHAIN-1 + CHAIN-3 + CHAIN-4 + the four-producer
tail (OD-7) are CLOSED.** Remaining: **CHAIN-2** (buildable — next leaf CHAIN-2a-i, design §(m)) and
**CHAIN-5** (signature frozen by the CHAIN↔ENTRY contract; gated on the rest of CHAIN-2 + ENTRY's
extractor reshape).

- [x] **CHAIN-3 — the `⋀^{d−1}(ℝ^{d+1})` duality bricks + Hodge panel-meet membership**
      (`Meet.lean` + `MeetHodge.lean`). **CLOSED 2026-06-17** (route = `⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line, NOT the
      withdrawn d=3-only `Φ̃`; the OD-8 route-α leaf chain h-0…h-4 closing on the join=meet duality
      `extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet`). Detail: design §"CHAIN"(f)/(g)/(h) + git +
      *Decisions made* → *Landed CHAIN-3 bricks*.
      - [~] **Cleanup-round candidates (forward, low-priority):** (1) the lifted `wedgeFixedLeft`
        block + `inf_range_wedgeFixedLeft` (ambient `{d}`) served the `Φ̃` route the CHAIN-3-finish
        recon **withdrew** (`finrank_sup_range_wedgeFixedLeft` / `extensor_toDual_extensor_eq_zero_of_perp`
        do NOT generalize — `dim Ω = C(d−1,2) = 1` only at `d=3`; the d=3 lemmas stay GREEN, **do NOT
        touch**) — revert the lifted infra to `Fin 4`. (2) The `finrank {n}^⊥ = k` metric transport is
        duplicated between (h-3) and (h-4) — factor a shared `finrank_toDualPerp_pair_eq` helper.
- [x] **CHAIN-1 — the `d`-fold candidate machinery** (`RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`). **CLOSED
      2026-06-18.** Graph-free over `ScrewSpace k`, no `d=3` content: the eq.-6.62 row-correspondence
      swap + the `ιc`-block candidate augment (the per-candidate column-op heterogeneity is CHAIN-2's
      bookkeeping). Detail: *Decisions made* → *Landed CHAIN-1 bricks* + git.
- [x] **CHAIN-4 — the `Fin (d+1)` incidence + Claim-6.12 discriminator**
      (`RigidityMatrix/Claim612.lean`). **CLOSED 2026-06-18** (4a–4d all landed; consumes CHAIN-3;
      OD-4 RESOLVED — existence/homogeneous, not alg-independence). Capstone = the discriminator
      `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen` (assembly of 4b line-data + 4c
      witness-join + CHAIN-3 (h-4)). Detail: design §(i)/(j) + git + *Decisions made* → *Landed
      CHAIN-4 bricks*.
- [ ] **CHAIN-2 — the `Fin d`-indexed candidate-reduction layer (eqs. 6.59–6.67)** (`CaseIII/`).
      Zeroth leaf (`G.ChainData n` record + 7 interior-split accessors, `Induction/Operations.lean`)
      + **CHAIN-2a** (per-candidate single-`i` reduction: `chainData_split_w6b_gates` +
      `chainData_split_realization`, both axiom-clean) **LANDED/CLOSED 2026-06-18.** Remaining:
      **CHAIN-2c — the single-base `Fin (k+1)` family dispatch** (design §(n)). The §(n) pass corrected
      the §(l)/§(m) 2b/2c framing (clause-ii flag, see *Current state*): KT/d=3 use ONE base, ONE `ρ₀`,
      ONE discriminator → `fin_cases u`; eq. (6.66) is absorbed (no separate 2b under the recommended
      route β). Sub-leaves: **CHAIN-2c-i** (`hpanelLI` + the one-shot discriminator pick — first
      buildable, all deps landed) → **CHAIN-2c-ii** (the uniform `Fin d` relabel arm = the
      genuinely-new crux; build adjudicates route α vs β / whether 2b's iso-transport resurfaces) →
      **CHAIN-2c-iii** (`chainData_dispatch` assembly, d=3 a zero-regression wrapper). ~3 build commits.
- [ ] **CHAIN-5 — the `d`-chain dispatch assembly** (`CaseIII/Realization.lean`).
      Replace `case_III_candidate_dispatch`; feed the (general-`k`) arm closers.
      **Signature now FROZEN** by the CHAIN↔ENTRY contract (`notes/Phase23-design.md`
      §"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract" C.3): `hdispatch` consumes a `G.ChainData n` record
      (the length-`d` chain) + the `splitOff (vtx 1)(vtx 0)(vtx 2) e₀` deficiency-0
      fact + the IH-generic base realization on that split. Keep the `d=3` dispatch
      as a `k=2`/length-3 wrapper (no `d=3` regression — C.4 zero-regression map).
- [x] **CHAIN tail — lift the four 23a-carried producers (OD-7 fold). CLOSED 2026-06-18.** After
      CHAIN-3, all four 23a-carried producers (`hbase_k`/`hcut_k`/`hcontract_k`/`hforget_k`) + both M4
      halves are general-`k`; the *one* genuinely-new piece was LEAF-0
      `linearIndependent_normals_of_algebraicIndependent_triple`. Detail: design §(k) + git +
      *Decisions made* → *Landed OD-7 bricks*.

## Blockers / open questions

The OD resolutions (full text in `notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN"(e)/(g)):

- **OD-8 — RESOLVED 2026-06-17.** The panel-meet range-membership
  `complementIso(j:=2)⟨n_u∧n',_⟩ ∈ range(⋀^k W ↪)` for `W = {n_u,n'}^⊥` is CLOSED via route α
  (the entire leaf chain h-0…h-3 LANDED): `complementIso` IS the Hodge `⋆`, O(n)-natural; the
  target transports the standard-frame membership along an orthogonal change of frame. Route β
  stays **rejected** (the annihilation→membership upgrade is the withdrawn `dim Φ̃` count
  `= C(d−1,2) > 1` for `d≥4`). Full text `notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN"(h); landed leaf in
  *Decisions made* below.
- **OD-6 — DECIDED: five leaves within ONE sub-phase 23b** (no separate duality
  letter). The arm-realization engine they feed is already general-`k`, so
  neither hard core stands alone as a deliverable. Split at contact only if
  CHAIN-2's index bookkeeping proves larger than estimated.
- **OD-7 — DECIDED: the four 23a-carried producers fold into CHAIN's tail**
  (after CHAIN-3), not a dedicated successor — the M4-forget reach-in *is*
  CHAIN-3's duality, and the conditioned-pair producers route through M4.
  Caveat: confirm at build that the duality is their *only* `d=3` reach-in.
- **OD-4 — RESOLVED 2026-06-18 (design-pass): existence/homogeneous route,
  alg-independence NOT forced.** Verdict + reasoning: Decisions-made below +
  `notes/Phase23-design.md` §(i). KT eq. (6.67) phrases the `d+1`-points step via
  alg-independence (p. 698 verbatim, confirmed against the `.refs/` PDF), but the
  landed d=3 formalization sidesteps it: the D-span runs off the already-general
  `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` (only hyp `LinearIndependent ℝ pbar`, via Lemma
  2.1), driven by **linear** independence of `d+1` **homogeneous** vectors, not
  KT's affine points / `(d−j)`-flat fact. The row #106 cross-product construction
  is **dead (zero live call sites)**. CHAIN-4 lifts as a numeral generalization of
  green bricks; one build-time residual (per-join panel-membership, CHAIN-4b).
- **(b) producer-shape mismatch — SETTLED 2026-06-17** (the docs-only
  contract-settle pass). The CHAIN↔ENTRY interface is frozen in
  `notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract": a `G.ChainData n` `structure`
  (length-`d` chain `vtx : Fin (d+1) → α`, `edge : Fin d → β`, `e₀`, the deg-2
  closures) is the shared shape. **No motive/IH change forced** (C.6): the chain
  data is purely combinatorial, the base `(G₁,q₁)` is the existing general-`k`
  `HasGenericFullRankRealization` premise pulled from the same 0-dof IH conjunct,
  the `d` candidate splits are smaller 0-dof graphs (no higher-dof `G_v` GAP-6).
  The reshape is **three decls in lockstep** (extractor / producer-`hcand` /
  dispatch-`hdispatch`); the `d=3` line is a zero-regression wrapper (C.4 map:
  chain `v₀v₁v₂v₃ = b—v—a—c`). CHAIN-5's signature is now authorable.
- **OD-1 (re-confirmed for CHAIN/ENTRY).** KT Lemma 5.4 short-cycle base is a
  real branch of the general-`d` chain entry (unlike `d=3`'s inline triangle
  floor); whether CHAIN's dispatch assumes the chain branch (ENTRY discharging
  the cycle branch) is an ENTRY-contract question.

## Hand-off / next phase

**CHAIN-1 + CHAIN-3 + CHAIN-4 are CLOSED** (CHAIN-4 closed by CHAIN-4d, the discriminator capstone
`exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen`), **and OD-7 (the four-producer tail) is
CLOSED** — all four 23a-carried producers + both M4 halves are general-`k` (see *Current state* +
*Decisions made* → *Landed OD-7 bricks*). The last OD-7 leaf, `case_I_dispatch_gen` + the
`hcontract_k` wire-up, landed 2026-06-18.

**Next = CHAIN-2c-i — `chainData_dispatch` steps 1–3** (the `d`-panel-normal LI producer `hpanelLI` +
the one-shot discriminator pick off the shared `ρ₀`). Design `notes/Phase23-design.md` §(n). It is
buildable now — all deps landed: the W6b half `chainData_split_w6b_gates` (the single `v₁`/`M₀` base
call), the discriminator `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence_gen` (CHAIN-4d), the
`ChainData` accessors, and the OD-7 LEAF-0 `linearIndependent_normals_of_algebraicIndependent_*`
normal-LI family (lifted to the `d`-normal family for `hpanelLI`). It is steps 1–3 of the
single-base dispatch (one W6b → `ρ₀`; the `d`-panel normals; one discriminator → `(u, n', hgate)`),
the faithful `Fin d` generalization of the green d=3 dispatch's lines 388–442, and is **independent of
the relabel-arm crux** deferred to CHAIN-2c-ii.

- **CHAIN-2c — the single-base `Fin (k+1)` family dispatch (design §(n)).** The §(n) design-pass
  (source-verified against KT eqs. 6.46–6.67 + the landed bodies) corrected the §(l)/§(m) framing of
  2b/2c. **Key finding:** KT Lemma 6.13 and the landed d=3 dispatch build the `d` candidates from ONE
  base `(G₁,q₁)` (the `v₁`-split = `M₀`), ONE `ρ₀`, ONE W6b call, ONE discriminator call, then
  `fin_cases u` over panels — eq. (6.66)'s ±r chain is **absorbed** into reusing one `ρ₀` across
  role-relabel arms (`_M2`/`_M3`), not materialized as a separate lemma. The landed
  `chainData_split_realization` (2a-ii) is per-`i`-split-shaped (a correct standalone lemma + the
  `M₀`-arm) but does **NOT** assemble the family the way §(m) assumed (the discriminator's single
  `r = ρ₀` is the `v₁` functional, not candidate `u`'s per-split `ρ`). **Recommended route β:** build
  2c as the `Fin (k+1)`-case generalization of the d=3 dispatch off the single `v₁` base; reuse 2a-ii
  only at `M₀`. Sub-leaves: **2c-i** (`hpanelLI` + single-discriminator pick — first buildable) →
  **2c-ii** (the uniform `Fin d` relabel arm transporting `ρ₀` to candidate `u`'s role = the
  genuinely-new crux, eq. 6.54 iso transport; **build adjudicates route α vs β** and whether the
  iso-transport "2b" resurfaces here) → **2c-iii** (`chainData_dispatch` assembly, d=3 a
  zero-regression wrapper). ~3 build commits. The `G.ChainData n` record + 7 accessors
  (`Induction/Operations.lean`, C.1) are landed; ENTRY owns the extractor producing the record (C.2).

  **CHAIN-2c route β LOCKED (user-adjudicated 2026-06-18; KT-source-verified, row 242).** Build 2c on
  the single `v₁` base + reuse 2a-ii only at `M₀`; the other candidates via the uniform `Fin (k+1)`
  relabel arm (2c-ii). The read-only verification of KT 6.46–6.67 **refuted route α's per-`i`-splits
  premise** — KT performs ONE split-off (6.46), the candidates are index-shift iso-copies of that one
  base (6.55, "exactly the same framework"), `r` is a single vector (6.66) — so there is no per-`i`
  split to iso-transport and route α is off the table. The genuinely-new work is the uniform `Fin d`
  relabel arm (2c-ii); not a motive/IH or spine carried-hypothesis change. Carry the crux as the
  standing `h…` idiom if it can't close in one sitting (never a `sorry`).

  **Blueprint-clarity obligation (owner-flagged 2026-06-18 — "absolutely clear").** Route β **absorbs**
  KT's explicit index-shift isos (6.54–6.56) + ±r chain (6.66) into the Lean relabel arm — so the
  `lem:case-III` general-`d` blueprint node's prose MUST materialize them explicitly: the single-`v₁`-base
  construction, the relabel isos `ρᵢ`, the single redundancy `r` carried ±-ly across the `d` panels,
  and the (6.67) discriminator. The Lean economizes; the exposition must not. Tracked in the
  BlueprintExposition ledger (the `lem:case-III` general-`d` entry); written as 2c-ii/CHAIN-5 land + at
  the phase-close re-read.

Re-pointing the d=3 discriminator `exists_complementIso_ne_zero_of_homogeneousIncidence` at CHAIN-4d's
`k:=2` instance (h-5) is now an available but **not-forced** simplification — the d=3 body + its
`complementIso_smul_eq_extensor_join` wrapper stay green meanwhile; defer to ASSEMBLY/cleanup. **The
OD-8 route β stays rejected** (the annihilation→membership upgrade is the withdrawn `dim Φ̃` count —
distinct from the CHAIN-2c "route β" just locked above; this is the CHAIN-3/OD-8 duality route). The CHAIN-3-finish
geometry (the `⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line route, NOT the withdrawn d=3-only `Φ̃` route) lives canonically in
`notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN"(f)/(h); the join=meet duality KT leaves implicit is captured in the
BlueprintExposition ledger (the CHAIN-3 entry).

**The CHAIN↔ENTRY contract is now settled** (`notes/Phase23-design.md`
§"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract", 2026-06-17) — the (b) build-recon gate is discharged:
CHAIN-5's `hdispatch`/`hcand` signature is frozen against the `G.ChainData n`
record (C.1/C.3), so it is now authorable. **CHAIN-2's *linear algebra* is independent
of the contract, but its *indexing* is contract-coupled** (recon §(l) overturned the
old "CHAIN-2 fully independent" claim): the `ChainData` record it indexes **is now authored
in Lean** (`Induction/Operations.lean`, 2026-06-18, the zeroth leaf — `deg_two` settled), so
the indexing prereq is discharged. CHAIN-5 is unblocked once the rest of CHAIN-2 lands
**and** ENTRY's extractor is reshaped.

**ENTRY obligation — PINNED (signature frozen; minted/built when its turn
comes).** ENTRY reshapes `Graph.exists_chain_data_of_noRigid` (`Reduction.lean:383`)
from the fixed `v,a,b,c` 4-tuple to the `G.ChainData n` producer
`exists_chainData_of_noRigid` (contract C.2 — KT Lemma 4.6 chain + Lemma 4.8
split-off minimality at general `d`, the "new combinatorial leaf" of the
OD-2/OD-3 verdict), and lifts the `6 ≤ bodyBarDim n` floor to the general
chain-length floor. The chain/cycle dichotomy (OD-1, KT Lemma 4.6 / Lemma 5.4)
is **ENTRY's to resolve at build** (contract C.5): the dispatch always consumes
a `ChainData` and never sees the cycle branch, so ENTRY's choice between
"chain-only extractor + cycle folded into base" (default) vs. "disjunction +
Lemma 5.4 short-cycle realization brick" is invariant for CHAIN-5's signature.
**The producer `case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k` (`Arms.lean:777`) is the chain
extractor's only consumer** (it calls the extractor inline at the `|V|≥4` arm,
Arms.lean:828–857) — its `hcand` slot is the third lockstep decl (C.0).

**Green-modulo boundary CHAIN hands downstream** (`notes/Phase23-design.md`
§"CHAIN"(d)): CHAIN discharges the general-`k` `hdispatch` (now against the frozen
`ChainData` contract) and lifts the four producers (OD-7). **ASSEMBLY** composes
the honest general-`d` Theorem 5.5, re-greens `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` +
`hub`, derives Thm 5.6, states Conjecture 1.2.

## Decisions made during this phase

(Phase-local choices land here as CHAIN leaves build. The opening recon's
decisions — OD-6/OD-7 resolved, OD-4 + (b) flagged — live in
`notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN"(e); the chain-data contract lives in its
§"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract".)

### Phase-local choices and proof techniques

Settled entries are one-line verdicts (decision + Lean name); proof techniques live
in git + `notes/FRICTION.md` + the design doc §"CHAIN"(f)/(g)/(h) + §"CHAIN↔ENTRY
contract". The forward detail (route to close the open leaves) is in *Current state*
/ *Hand-off* above.

**Recons / design decisions (detail in `notes/Phase23-design.md`):**
- **Opened on a leaf-level recon, not a build** — found the arm-engine already
  general-`k`, only the dispatch `d=3`; surfaced flag (b) → §"CHAIN"(a)–(e).
- **CHAIN↔ENTRY chain-data contract settled** — `G.ChainData n` structure +
  producer/`hdispatch` signatures; no motive/IH change forced (clause ii) →
  §"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract" C.0–C.6.
- **CHAIN-3-finish recon: the `⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line route, NOT the d=3 `Φ̃` route**
  (a line has **2** normals at every `d`, **d−1** points); `finrank_sup_range_wedgeFixedLeft`
  / `extensor_toDual_extensor_eq_zero_of_perp` **withdrawn** (dead d=3-only, kept green
  as the d=3 wrapper) → §"CHAIN"(f). KT-route-checked (the join=meet duality KT leaves
  implicit) → §"CHAIN"(f) *Coordinator KT-route check*.
- **OD-8 RESOLVED: route α (`complementIso` O(n)-equivariance); β rejected** — the whole
  leaf chain h-0…h-3 landed, the panel-meet range-membership is closed. `complementIso` IS the
  Hodge `⋆`; β rests on the withdrawn `dim Φ̃` count → §"CHAIN"(h).
- **OD-4 RESOLVED 2026-06-18: existence/homogeneous route, alg-independence NOT forced**
  (overturns the prior "forced" lean). The landed d=3 N3a works homogeneously (§1.42 R1-affine):
  the eq.-(6.67) D-span runs off `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` (already general-`k`, only hyp
  `LinearIndependent ℝ pbar`, via Lemma 2.1) — **linear** independence of `d+1` **homogeneous**
  vectors, never KT's affine points / `(d−j)`-flat-in-union (the alg-independence consequence is on
  the route the formalization sidesteps). Source-verified: KT p.698 verbatim (`.refs/` PDF) vs. the
  landed bodies; the row #106 cross-product construction is **dead (zero live call sites)**. No new
  `AlgebraicIndependent` lemma; site (b) is not a site (only site (a), nested seed-rank, stays live).
  Per-join panel-membership generalizes combinatorially (join `{a,b}`⊂`Πᵢ` iff `i+1∈{a,b}`). One
  build residual flagged (CHAIN-4b). CHAIN-4 decomposed into 4a–4d → §"CHAIN"(i)/(j).
- **CHAIN-2 decomposition (recon 2026-06-18, read-only Plan + coordinator source-verify) — overturns
  §(c)'s framing.** The named `caseIIICandidate`/`case_III_old_new_blocks`/`case_III_rank_certification`
  chain is **already general-`k`** (the only `d=3`-pin in `CaseIII/` is `Realization.lean`'s dispatch =
  CHAIN-5); §(c)'s "(now `q : α × Fin 4`-shaped)" was false. CHAIN-2 = the `Fin d`-indexed reduction
  *layer* (2a per-`i` / 2b ±r-chain / 2c family) on top of that chain + closed CHAIN-1 →
  §"CHAIN"(l).
- **CHAIN-2a design-pass (2026-06-18) — VERDICT: re-index, gates threaded from above** (settles the
  session-#7 open question against the landed bodies). CHAIN-2a's per-`i` reduction is a
  `case_III_arm_realization` (general-`k`) re-index, NOT a from-scratch gate construction: the gate
  family is carried as hypotheses by both the certification (`Candidate.lean:1403`) and the arm closer
  (`Arms.lean:72`), and supplied from above by two general-`k` producers (W6b
  `exists_candidateRow_bottomRows_of_rigidOn` + CHAIN-4d discriminator, fed by
  `case_III_nested_rank_lower_all_k`). Sub-leaves: CHAIN-2a-i `chainData_split_arm_gates` (the two
  producer calls) → CHAIN-2a-ii `chainData_split_realization` (the arm-closer re-index). One
  build-time wiring flag (arm form + `h622lb`/`hIH` instantiation), no motive change → §"CHAIN"(m).
- **CHAIN-2a CLOSED 2026-06-18 — the complete single-`i` reduction (re-index verdict CONFIRMED).**
  Two axiom-clean leaves in `CaseIII/Realization.lean`: `chainData_split_w6b_gates` (the W6b half — a
  `{k}`-general flat-tuple lift of the d=3 dispatch's W6b region: one
  `exists_candidateRow_bottomRows_of_rigidOn` call fed `h622lb`, producing the chain-order
  `hρe₀`/`hρGv`/`hw`/`hwmem` bundle; flat-tuple so it is reusable AND callable at `k=2`) and
  `chainData_split_realization` (the re-index core — reads the per-`i` split tuple off the `ChainData`
  accessors, produces `h622lb` from `case_III_nested_rank_lower_all_k`, consumes the W6b bundle, builds
  the `ends₁`-override congruence, calls `case_III_arm_realization`). The §(m) clause-(ii) flag resolved
  to `case_III_arm_realization` directly (no `_M3` relabel — chain `v—a`/`v—b` matches the arm closer's
  `(v,a,b)` roles). **The transversal half stays a hypothesis `htrans`** (single-`i` slot CHAIN-2c
  fills via the discriminator, whose arbitrary panel `u`↔candidate `i` match is the family glue). No
  FRICTION (verbatim d=3-dispatch template re-use over the accessors; the `Fin d`-index `.symm`s and
  the `Gv.Loopless` `haveI` are landed idioms).
- **CHAIN-2b/2c design-pass (2026-06-18) — VERDICT: single-base `Fin (k+1)` dispatch (route β); ±r
  chain absorbed, NOT a separate lemma; corrects §(l)/§(m)'s 2b/2c framing** (source-verified against
  KT eqs. 6.46–6.67 + the landed bodies → §"CHAIN"(n)). KT Lemma 6.13 and the green d=3 dispatch build
  the `d` candidates from ONE base `(G₁,q₁)` (the `v₁`-split = `M₀`), ONE `ρ₀`, ONE W6b call, ONE
  discriminator call, then `fin_cases u` over panels — eq. (6.66) is absorbed into reusing `ρ₀` across
  role-relabel arms (`_M2`/`_M3`), so 2b is NOT a standalone lemma under route β. The landed
  `chainData_split_realization` (2a-ii) is per-`i`-split-shaped (correct as a standalone + the
  `M₀`-arm) but does NOT assemble the family the §(m) "supply `htrans` at the discriminator's `u`"
  reading assumed (the discriminator's single `r = ρ₀` is the `v₁` functional, not candidate `u`'s
  per-split `ρ`). Sub-leaves: 2c-i (`hpanelLI` + single-discriminator pick, first buildable, deps
  landed) → 2c-ii (the uniform `Fin d` relabel arm = genuinely-new crux, eq. 6.54 iso transport) →
  2c-iii (assembly). **Clause-ii flag (coordinator decision, NOT adjudicated):** route β (single base
  + reuse 2a-ii only at `M₀`, recommended) vs. α (per-`i` splits + iso-transport so `r` matches each
  candidate's `ρ`); either way the new work is the relabel arm, no motive/IH/spine-carry change.
- **`G.ChainData n` record LANDED 2026-06-18 (CHAIN-2 zeroth leaf)** — the contract-C.1 length-`d`
  chain `structure` in `Induction/Operations.lean` (the `splitOff` home): fields `d`/`hd`/`vtx :
  Fin (d+1)→α`/`edge : Fin d→β`/`e₀` + `vtx_mem`/`vtx_inj`/`link`/`edge_inj`/`deg_two`/`e₀_fresh`,
  plus accessors `ChainData.pred_edge_ne`/`isLink_edge`. **`deg_two` settled:** interior vertices
  guarded by `0 < (i:ℕ)` (no `OfNat (Fin d)` literal — the `0`/`1` `Fin d` literals fail to synth at
  general `d`), predecessor edge as `edge ⟨(i:ℕ)-1, _⟩`; d=3-map (C.4) verified by `rfl`/`decide`
  (`vtx 1=v`, `vtx 2=a`; closures `edge 0=e_b`, `edge 1=eₐ`, `edge 2=e_c`). `n` is a phantom index
  (no field uses it) carried only so the contract can write `G.ChainData n`. Axiom-clean; no FRICTION.
- **`ChainData` interior-split geometry accessors LANDED 2026-06-18 (CHAIN-2 zeroth leaf, part 2)** —
  five `ChainData.{pred_succ_eq_castSucc, isLink_pred_edge, isLink_succ_edge, succ_ne_pred_castSucc,
  deg_two_split}` lemmas (`Induction/Operations.lean`) exposing, for an interior index `i` (`0 < (i:ℕ)`),
  the per-`i` `(v,a,b,e_a,e_b)` split tuple `case_III_rank_certification` consumes: split body
  `vtx i.castSucc`; the two chain edges `edge i` / `edge ⟨(i:ℕ)-1,_⟩` oriented *out of* it (the
  predecessor via `pred_succ_eq_castSucc` — `(⟨(i:ℕ)-1,_⟩).succ = i.castSucc` — then `.symm`); distinct
  neighbors `vtx i.succ ≠ vtx (⟨(i:ℕ)-1,_⟩).castSucc`; and the degree-2 closure re-oriented (`Or.symm`
  of the field). Same `0 < (i:ℕ)` + `congrArg Fin.val`/`omega` idiom as `pred_edge_ne`. Axiom-clean; no
  FRICTION (the `Fin.coe_castSucc → val_castSucc` deprecation was a one-name swap).
- **OD-7 `hcontract_k` decomposition (recon 2026-06-18, read-only Plan + coordinator source-verify):**
  5 leaves (6 if h65 splits) — `all_k`/`nonsimple`/`h65`/`dispatch` numeral passes (one `_perp_grade`
  swap; `_all_k` is all-*dof* not all-grade, a trap), the *one* genuinely-new piece LEAF-0
  `linearIndependent_normals_of_algebraicIndependent_triple` (fixed-3-row LI at `Fin (k+2)`; landed
  `…_general` gives `k+1` rows, h65 has only 3 vertices). No motive/IH change → §"CHAIN"(k).

**Landed CHAIN-3 bricks** (the `_grade` lifts are verbatim — the route is general mathlib, grade
enters nothing; `d=3` names kept as `(d:=3)` instances, no blueprint pin moved). CHAIN-3 is CLOSED;
construction internals live in git + `notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN"(f)/(h) + the
BlueprintExposition CHAIN-3 entry (the duality KT leaves implicit,
`extensor_join_proportional_complementIso_meet`). The two forward cleanup-candidates are the `[~]`
sub-bullet under the *CHAIN leaf checklist* CHAIN-3 entry.

**Landed OD-7 (four-producer tail) bricks** (OD-7 CLOSED 2026-06-18; per-brick names + the `hcontract_k`
five-leaf split + construction internals live in git + commit messages + `notes/Phase23-design.md`
§(k), the canonical home; all axiom-clean).
All four producers + both M4 halves are now general-`k` via verbatim numeral passes over the d=3 bodies
(`screwDim/ScrewSpace 2→k`, `Fin 4→Fin (k+2)`, dof `k→c`; d=3 lemmas now `k:=2` wrappers/instances,
blueprint pins unmoved, §58 idiom). Two settled cross-cutting notes: the *one* genuinely-new piece was
LEAF-0 `linearIndependent_normals_of_algebraicIndependent_triple` (fixed-3-row LI, **not** a numeral
pass — the landed `…_general` gives `k+1` rows, h65 has only 3 vertices); the M4-forget reach-in routes
solely through the CHAIN-3 (h-4) duality + the new slot-0 rescale `extensor_update_smul` (confirming
caveat (e): the duality *is* the only M4-forget d=3 reach-in).

**Landed CHAIN-4 bricks** (CHAIN-4 CLOSED 2026-06-18, `RigidityMatrix/Claim612.lean`; leaf names + per-leaf
verdicts + construction internals live in git + `notes/Phase23-design.md` §(i)/(j), the canonical home;
all axiom-clean). Two settled cross-cutting notes:
4d's `MeetHodge` import did NOT regress the file's `⋀²ℝ⁴` proofs to a §59 whnf timeout; 4b has two faithful
divergences from the d=3 body (off-one-panel hyp + `LinearIndependent ℝ p` conclusion via the new `hpbar`),
so the d=3 lemma stays its own green body, not a `k:=2` wrapper.

**Landed CHAIN-1 bricks** (CHAIN-1 CLOSED 2026-06-18, `RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`, graph-free over
`ScrewSpace k`, axiom-clean; both single-`Unit` predecessors re-derived as `ιc := Unit` corollaries,
blueprint pins unmoved): the eq.-6.62 row-correspondence swap `linearIndependent_sumElim_candidateBlock_swap`
(+ mirror `…_block_swap`) and the `ιc`-block candidate augment `linearIndependent_sum_pinned_block_augment_block`
(+ `…_augment_candidateRow_block`). The per-candidate column-op heterogeneity (each `i` its own `Φᵢ`) is
**CHAIN-2's** bookkeeping (augment fires one body at a time).

### Promoted to TACTICS-GOLF / TACTICS-QUIRKS / FRICTION / DESIGN

- *`Fin d`-index arithmetic at general `d` (no `+1`): a `0 < i` guard / `i - 1` predecessor wants
  `OfNat (Fin d)` literals that don't synth — for plain index bookkeeping (not a `d=0`-false slot),
  guard `0 < (i:ℕ)` + build `⟨(i:ℕ)-1, _⟩` rather than carry `[NeZero d]`* → FRICTION [idiom]
  *`Fin d`-index arithmetic (general `d`): guard `0 < (i:ℕ)`…*.
- *Lifting a `Fin (k+2)`-point-family lemma to general `k` may need `[NeZero k]` (the `0 : Fin k`
  literal in a slot-`0` rescale; the statement is genuinely false at `k=0`) — carry the hypothesis,
  don't fight the `OfNat (Fin k) 0` synthesis* → FRICTION [idiom] *Lifting a `Fin (k+2)`-point-family
  lemma to general `k`…*.
- *`map_update_smul` on `ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti` at general grade: `(M := Fin (d+1) → ℝ)` annotation +
  the `have … := …map_update_smul v i c (v i)` term form (not `rw`, which leaves `Module ℝ …`
  un-synthesized) + `Function.update_eq_self` to clear the `update v i (v i)` residual* → FRICTION
  [idiom] *`ExteriorAlgebra.ιMulti ℝ n` needs `(M := ...)`…* (Phase 23b reuse).
- *The `⧸` quotient notation (`M ⧸ P`) needs a direct `import Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Quotient.Basic`
  even when `Submodule.mkQ` resolves by name (a notation must be imported, not merely reachable) —
  or drop the type ascription and let `set π := P.mkQ` infer the codomain* → TACTICS-QUIRKS § 60 /
  FRICTION [mirrored] *`linearIndependent_sumElim_block_swap`…* (Gotcha).
- *To use the mirrored `Finset.univ_orderEmbOfFin` on a `powersetCard` `default` index,
  surface `↑default = univ` with a `rfl`-`have` first (it won't `simp` out on its own)*
  → FRICTION [idiom] *To use the mirrored `Finset.univ_orderEmbOfFin` on a `powersetCard`…*.
- *A `-/` inside a docstring word (`grade-/ambient`) closes the doc comment early
  → "unexpected identifier; expected 'lemma'" inside the prose* → TACTICS-QUIRKS § 57.
- *After lifting an in-place numeral-pinned `def` to implicit `{d}`, a numeral
  consumer's `omega` mis-atomizes the `(d:=3)`-vs-numeral elaborations of one term
  (free-variable counterexample, never reads the bridging hyp) — use `linarith` /
  `simpa using h`* → TACTICS-QUIRKS § 58 / FRICTION [idiom] *Generalizing an in-place
  numeral-pinned `def`…*.
- *`Set.powersetCard.compl` inside a hypothesis (no expected `powersetCard _ m` type)
  leaves the target cardinality `m` a stuck metavariable — pin `(m := …)` explicitly*
  → FRICTION [idiom] *`Set.powersetCard.compl` inside a hypothesis…*.
- *`set b := e` folds `e` out of the goal too, so a later `rw`/`simp only [lib_lemma]`
  whose LHS pattern mentions `e` silently fails (`simp only` reports args "unused") —
  the goal-side / library-lemma variant of the `set` fold; drop the `set`* →
  TACTICS-QUIRKS § 43 (goal-side / library-lemma variant).
- *A new `InnerProductSpace`/`EuclideanSpace` import poisons a pre-existing exterior-algebra proof
  in the same file to a `whnf` timeout (the `PiLp 2` instances become defeq-visible to `⋀`-term
  elaboration) — keep the bridge in a `Mathlib/` mirror, house metric-using leaves in a downstream
  file* → TACTICS-QUIRKS § 59 / FRICTION [mirrored] *`EuclideanSpace.inner_eq_basisFun_toDual`…*.
- *`induction h using Submodule.span_induction` fails on an applied membership subject (`n j`) —
  hoist a `∀ y ∈ span, …` helper, induct on the bound `y`* → FRICTION [idiom] *`induction h using
  Submodule.span_induction` fails …*.
- *`EuclideanSpace.equiv` is a `ContinuousLinearEquiv`, not a `LinearEquiv` — round-trips need the
  `ContinuousLinearEquiv.*` forms (a `LinearEquiv.apply_symm_apply` `simp only` no-ops)* → FRICTION
  [idiom] *`EuclideanSpace.equiv` is a `ContinuousLinearEquiv`…*.
- *Re-orienting a proportionality `c • x = y` into `c⁻¹ • y = x` — use `inv_smul_eq_iff₀ hcne` on the
  goal, not `rw [← hc, smul_smul]` (the nested-`•` `rw` chain fails on `⋀`-subtype elements)* →
  TACTICS-GOLF § 19.
- *Recovering a permuted-incidence `Fin n` wrapper from a general `_gen` lemma — feed `_gen` the
  reordered indexed family (`n ∘ ![…]`, LI via `hn.comp _ (by decide)`) and read the pairings back
  through the (definitional) reorder, rather than re-proving the d=3 body* → FRICTION [idiom]
  *Recovering a permuted-incidence `Fin n` wrapper…*.
- *Pushing a functional through `c • x` on an `abbrev`'d carrier (`ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k …`): `rw
  [map_smul]` (even a concrete `rw [hsmul]`) mis-fires on the smul instance — close with `exact
  (r.map_smul c _).trans …`* → TACTICS-GOLF § 19 (companion) / FRICTION [idiom] *Pushing a functional
  through a `c • x` on an `abbrev`'d carrier…*.
