# Phase 23b — general-`d` Case-III chain dispatch + `⋀^{d−1}` duality [CHAIN] (work log)

**Status: ✓ CLOSED 2026-06-21** (user-adjudicated clean-break close; the CHAIN target — `chainData_dispatch`
(2c-iii) — was NOT reached). **This note is the ARCHIVE of what CHAIN delivered + the route-history verdicts;
the live forward state is `notes/Phase23c.md`.**

**23b delivered** (all axiom-clean): CHAIN-1/3/4, OD-7 (four producers + M4, general-`k`), CHAIN-2a, the
CHAIN-2c-i/ii foundation, and the full `hρGv` machinery — algebraic core + chain-induction (LEAVES 1–4, the
KT-(6.66) telescope) + seed bridge (P3) + slot core + per-edge perp + STEP-2 transport + the composition
`chainData_freshEdge_slot_perp` + the pre-assembled engine slot `chainData_relabel_arm_hρGv`.

**…and a decisive characterization of the `hρGv`-seam as a HARD CORE.** `chainData_relabel_arm_hρGv` is a
CORRECT carried-hypothesis lemma whose `hφ`@`endsσρ` slot is the **member-mapping wall**, now source-verified
as **intrinsic to KT's argument** (NOT a Lean artifact): KT (6.62) carries a *moving* redundant row (verbatim
"row `(v₀v₂)ᵢ∗` ⇔ row `(v₀v₁)ᵢ∗`"; "column correspondence follows from the isomorphism `ρᵢ`"), so producing
the FIXED shared `ρ0`-member at the relabelled candidate is structurally impossible. All four route families
are dead, adversarially verified: seed-advancing fold (§(o‴)(I.8.15)), base→candidate transport (§(o‴)(I.8.12)),
re-fire the existential A-1 (§(o‴)(I.8.19)-ADDENDUM, re-introduces the rejected Fix B), column-op/whole-matrix
submatrix-containment (§(o‴)(I.8.20), KT's own (6.62) only gives the member-moving relabel-image inclusion).
The `d=3` line stays **fully green** (M₃ `i=2` is the degenerate single-swap — no fold, no `hφ` slot).

**The unfinished CHAIN tail** (the `hρGv` Case-III chain arm + `chainData_dispatch` (CHAIN-2c-iii) + CHAIN-5)
**+ the redundancy-carry RE-ARCHITECTURE DECISION it requires** are carried to **23c** (`notes/Phase23c.md`,
which loads the full architectural-decision context: the wall, why `d=3` worked, the gate, the four dead
routes, and the (A) KT-faithful-rethink vs (B) ENTRY-carry fork). **NO C.0–C.6 / motive change** was forced
(the wall is machinery below dispatch C.3 + record C.1). The integer **Phase 23 stays in progress**
(ENTRY/ASSEMBLY remain). Sub-phase codes: `CARRIER`=23a closed, `CHAIN`=23b closed, 23c = the redundancy-carry
re-architecture + chain-dispatch completion (open), `ENTRY`/`ASSEMBLY` code-only.

**Orientation.** The **23b (CHAIN layer)** rolling state + hand-off. Cross-phase plan + the detailed
leaf-level recon arcs live in `notes/Phase23-design.md` (§"CHAIN"; the live `hρGv` arc is §(o‴)(I.6)/(I.8));
program map `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`. Superseded route-history (clean-relabel refutation, the FIX-FORK,
the engine-slot adjudication, the pre-GAP-FOUND "arm converges" framing) is in design §(o‴) + git, **not**
re-narrated here.

## Current state

> **[CLOSED 2026-06-21 — the live forward state is `notes/Phase23c.md`.](#)** The text below is the **archive**
> of the CHAIN arc's final verdict (the hard core); 23c carries the architectural decision + the unfinished
> CHAIN tail. Canonical detailed home: design §(o‴)(I.8.18)–(I.8.20).

**WHOLE-MATRIX RE-ARCHITECTURE — ROUTE DIES, IT IS THE WALL. The I.8.19-ADDENDUM(C) open question (can KT's
column-op submatrix-containment carry the FIXED `ρ0` where the fold could not?) is ADJUDICATED AGAINST the
route (§(o‴)(I.8.20), 2026-06-21, KT pp. 696–698 read directly from the PDF; every load-bearing claim
re-derived from the landed bodies).** Trail: the I.8.19 pass proposed producing the candidate `hρGv` by
re-firing A-1 at the candidate (LEAF C); the ADDENDUM REFUTED LEAF C (A-1 is EXISTENTIAL in `ρ`,
`Candidate.lean:414`, but the dispatch establishes a SINGLE shared `ρ0` once at the base —
`Realization.lean:404–411` — runs the discriminator ONCE on `ρ0` — `:439–441` — and threads it into every arm
— `:502/:514/:592`; the capstone `Claim612.lean:1462` takes ONE `r`, single-`r` REQUIRED, KT (6.66)), leaving
the residual question of whether the column-op (a structurally-different mechanism — no seed-advance through
`d−1` frameworks) could carry the FIXED member. **§(o‴)(I.8.20) settles it: NO.** KT's (6.61) submatrix-
containment is relabel-MEDIATED on BOTH axes — (6.62) "the column correspondence follows from the isomorphism
`ρᵢ`", and verbatim p. 696 "the row associated with `(v₀v₂)ᵢ∗` in `R(G₁,q₁)` corresponds to the row associated
with `(v₀v₁)ᵢ∗` in `R(G,pᵢ)`" (the redundant row MOVES). So the column-op inclusion is the relabel-IMAGE
inclusion `span ((funLeft ρᵢ).dualMap '' base-rows) ⊆ span (candidate-rows)` (= `chainData_bottom_relabel` at
the span level), which moves `hingeRow v₀v₂ ρ0 ↦ hingeRow v₀v₁ ρ0` — NOT the fixed member. The FIXED-member
inclusion `span(base) ⊆ span(candidate)` (no relabel on members) WOULD carry it but is FALSE/unbuilt and is
NOT KT's shape (the load-bearing link `edge 0 = v₀v₁` is recorded at `endsσρ`, not `ends₀`). The (6.66) `±r`
carry is the seed-advancing telescope (the orphan-candidate subtree encoding (6.44)); its OUTPUT is the MOVED
member `hingeRow (vtx i−1)(vtx i+1) ρ0` (`Relabel.lean:4174`), its INPUT is the fixed member at `(endsσρ,q)`
(`:4165`) — it is NOT a member-fixing second transport. **The column-op SHARES the §(o‴)(I.8.15)/(I.8.18)
member-mapping wall.** This is the honest "it's the wall" verdict — no buildable-looking span-inclusion that
quietly relies on the member moving was manufactured (the refuted LEAF-C trap).

**THE RESIDUE — A USER-ADJUDICATION FORK (§(o‴)(I.8.20) VERDICT).** Every structurally-distinct mechanism
(seed-advancing fold, base→candidate transport, re-fire A-1, column-op submatrix-containment) now reduces to
the FIXED-`ρ0`-member-at-`(endsσρ,qρ)` wall — there is no fixed-member transport in tree and KT's own
construction moves the member. The residue is a FORK for the user (NOT a buildable leaf, pre-judged neither
between the two arms): **(B)** carry `ρ0`/`hφ@endsσρ` as a hypothesis to ENTRY (the landed
`chainData_relabel_arm_hρGv` shape, `:4671`) — FLAGGED LIKELY-DEAD (I.8.12 ROUTE β / I.8.15 B3 / I.8.18(B)):
the wall RELOCATES to ENTRY, no new transport appears there unless ENTRY re-derives the redundancy NATIVELY
against `endsσρ` (a different graph-construction question, unexplored); or **(rethink)** a more fundamental
Lean-architecture rethink of the general-`d` arm — abandon the materialized-fold modelling of KT (6.62), carry
the abstract `r ∈ ℝ^D` of (6.66) + the `Mᵢ`-block FORM rather than a transported fixed dual-vector
(genuinely-new realization architecture, cost UNKNOWN — this is §I.8.18's recommendation (A) RE-SCOPED, since
(A)'s LEAF-C assembly is now known unsound).

**WHAT SURVIVES.** F1 (A-1 parametric in `(Gab,Gv,ends,q)`) / F2 (A-1's outputs match the engine's
`hρGv`/`hwmem` slot types) TRUE but NECESSARY-NOT-SUFFICIENT (they missed the single-`r` coupling). F4
RE-CONFIRMED against the actual conclusions (`Basic.lean:1328/1371` conclude `LinearIndependent`, `span` only
in `hdiff` — CHAIN-1 is LI-preservation, the whole-matrix span-inclusion is UNBUILT). LEAF A
`chainData_candidate_rigidOn` (member-free rigid-on transport, P=2) independently fine but does NOT rescue the
route (the crux is the FIXED-member `hρGv`, not rigidity). **The seed-advancing `hφ`-spine (slot core / fold
spine / seed-advancing gate / `chainData_relabel_arm_hρGv`) + the perp/telescope subtree stay confirm-and-delete
CANDIDATEs** — under the §I.8.20 "route dies" verdict they are dead-for-this-route, but route B may reuse the
telescope at ENTRY (it encodes (6.44)/(6.66)), so confirm-and-delete fires only at the route-SETTLE commit =
the user's fork choice, NOT here. STAYS regardless: the single-step carrier W9a
(`funLeft_dualMap_sub_acolumn_mem_span_rigidityRows`, `:865`); the engine/rank-cert (parametric in
`(Gv,ends,q)`); `chainData_bottom_relabel`; CHAIN-1 LI machinery; `d=3` M₃ (`i=2`) zero-regression unaffected.

**ROUTE α STAYS INFEASIBLE (design §(o‴)(I.8.15), 2026-06-21 — OPTION B, Lean-grounded; the per-step selector
fold is the wrong tool).** The membership fold's per-step gate (`Relabel.lean:1201`, `hends'_off`) permits each
step to move the selector ONLY at `edge(s+1)`/`edge(s+2)`, so the accumulated selector can differ from `ends₀`
ONLY on `{edge 1,…,edge i}`. But `shiftEdgePerm i` (the `(i+2)`-CYCLE `formPerm [edge 0, e₀, edge i, edge 1, …,
edge(i−1)]`) moves `edge 0`/`e₀` (both outside that set), has NO adjacent-swap factorization, and the
discrepancy is load-bearing on `G−vᵢ` (`edge 0` survives there). ROUTE α was a category error (reaching a cycle
by adjacent transpositions). All 5 ROUTE-α leaves abandoned.

**Why the row-354 T-1/T-2/T-3 plan was MIS-TARGETED (the 2nd level/shape mismatch; design §(o‴)(I.8.11)).**
The consumer `chainData_freshEdge_perp_of_baseRedundancy` (`Relabel.lean:4311`) pins THREE hyps at
INCOMPATIBLE levels: `hcomb` framework-free with RHS HARDCODED `hingeRow (vtx 0)(vtx 2) ρ₀` (BASE vertices,
feeding LEAF-4 whose `ab₁/ab₂ = vtx 0/vtx 2` is rigid) AND `hrv` at the CANDIDATE framework. Feeding the
re-indexed family (T-1/T-2): T-1's `hrv` matches, but T-2's `hcomb` LHS becomes `hingeRow (σ.symm v₀)(σ.symm
v₂) ρ₀ = hingeRow v₀ v₁ ρ₀` (Lean-verified `σ.symm v₀ = v₀`, `σ.symm v₂ = v₁` ∀ `i ≥ 2`) ≠ the consumer's
`hingeRow v₀ v₂ ρ₀`. Feeding un-relabelled: `hcomb`/`hlink` match but `hrv` wants candidate-block at the SAME
edge, which `ofNormals_supportExtensor_relabel_perm` relates only to base-block at the DIFFERENT edge `σ_e f`.
So neither feeds the consumer. KT-source check (eqs. 6.62/6.66/6.67, p.696–698): KT works ENTIRELY at the base
`(G₁,q₁) = G−v₁`; the candidate enters only via the row-correspondence iso `ρᵢ`, never as a separate
`ofNormals (G−vᵢ)` framework — vindicating STEP 1's base-index call.

**Standing context (settled; full detail in the design doc).** (1) *Architectural:* metric-using Hodge
leaves live in `MeetHodge.lean`, never metric-free `Meet.lean` (a `PiL2` import → `whnf` timeout) —
TACTICS-QUIRKS § 59. (2) *Orientation:* the arm-engine is already general-`k`; CHAIN replaced only the d=3
dispatch + its `⋀²ℝ⁴` discriminator with the `d`-candidate chain + `⋀^{d−1}` duality finish. (3) *Contract
(SETTLED):* the CHAIN↔ENTRY `G.ChainData n` shape is frozen — three lockstep decls (ENTRY extractor /
producer `…hcand` / CHAIN-5 `hdispatch`), no motive/IH change (C.6), `d=3` zero-regression (design
§"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract").

**Route β — LOCKED** (user-adjudicated, row 242): ONE `v₁`-base + the uniform `Fin (k+1)` relabel arm; route
B is **within** β. (Blueprint-clarity obligation: *Hand-off* CHAIN-2c bullet + design §(o″).) The arm engine
`case_III_arm_realization` (`Arms.lean:72`) binds `hwmem` (`:96`) and `hρGv` (`:91`) at the
**removeVertex-level** `ofNormals Gv ends q` (`Gv = G−vᵢ`, `ends` relabelled, `q = qρ`, `(a,b)=(vᵢ₊₁,vᵢ₋₁)`;
KT-faithful, confirmed vs `chainData_bottom_relabel`'s output type `Relabel.lean:1960–1972`). d=3 M₃ `i=2`
cycle is the single-swap involution (zero-regression); `case_III_candidate_dispatch` stays green until
CHAIN-5/ENTRY wrap it (C.4).

## Landed-leaf inventory (the arm assembly references these names)

One-line LANDED verdicts (file, axiom-clean; detail = git + Lean docstrings + design §(o‴)(I.6)/(I.8)):

- **`chainData_bottom_relabel`** (`Relabel.lean`) — the genuine-row `hwmem` leaf; per-member
  `(shiftPerm i.castSucc)⁻¹` cycle transport of the base bottom-row disjunction to the candidate arm.
- **`chainData_freshEdge_slot_mem`** (`Relabel.lean`) — LEAF 5 `hρGv`-slot core; lifts the `i=3` gate to the
  concrete fold framework, peeling the slot row `hingeRow vᵢ₋₁ vᵢ₊₁ ρ₀` off the fold output minus the
  surviving rows. Takes an abstract per-edge `hperp`.
- **`chainData_freshEdge_perp_of_baseRedundancy`** (`Relabel.lean:4311`) — witness-free per-edge perp: for any
  surviving edge (`2 ≤ s < d`), `ρ₀ ⊥ Fva.supportExtensor (edge s)` from the edge-grouped base redundancy.
  Consumes `hlink`/`hcomb` (framework-free, RHS hardcoded `hingeRow (vtx 0)(vtx 2) ρ₀`) + `hrv` at the framework
  `Fva = ofNormals (G−vᵢ) ends qρ` (free `ends`/`qρ`). Mechanism = LEAF 4's `group = −ρ₀` +
  `edgeGroup_acolumn_mem_block` + `mem_hingeRowBlock_iff`. **CORRECT call site (design §(o‴)(I.8.11)) = base
  index `i := ⟨1⟩`** (then `Fva` = base `G−v₁`, A-1's output feeds it DIRECTLY — STEP 1 of the corrected route).
- **`chainData_freshEdge_perp_transport_base_to_candidate`** (`Relabel.lean`, STEP 2, LANDED 2026-06-21,
  axiom-clean) — the single-scalar per-edge perp transport: a base perp at `(if s=0 then e₀ else edge(s+1))`
  (arbitrary graph `Gb`) → the candidate framework's perp at `edge s` (the relabelled `endsσρ`/`qρ` forms).
  `ofNormals_supportExtensor_relabel_perm` (the support-extensor coincidence) + the `shiftEdgePerm` edge action
  (interior `s≥1` / head `s=0`) + supportExtensor graph-independence.
- **`chainData_freshEdge_slot_perp`** (`Relabel.lean`, STEP 1∘STEP 2 composition, LANDED 2026-06-21,
  axiom-clean) — the exact `hperp s` shape `chainData_freshEdge_slot_mem` consumes. From A-1's base data
  (`hlink`/`hrv`/`hcomb`/`hdeg1`/`hρe₀`, all at the BASE `G−v₁`) it produces the candidate-`i` perp
  `ρ₀ ⊥ Fva.supportExtensor (edge s)` for any surviving `s+1<i`: STEP 1 at base index `⟨1⟩` (interior `s≥1`)
  or `hρe₀` (head `s=0`) → STEP 2. The single call the arm's `hρGv` slot makes for the whole perp obligation.
- **`chainData_relabel_arm_hρGv`** (`Relabel.lean`, STEP 3 `hρGv` slot, LANDED 2026-06-21, axiom-clean) —
  the pre-assembled engine `hρGv` slot at candidate `i`: `hingeRow vᵢ₊₁ vᵢ₋₁ (−ρ₀) ∈ span (ofNormals (G−vᵢ)
  endsσρ qρ)`, exactly `case_III_arm_realization`'s `hρGv` (M₃ sign `−ρ₀`). Composes `hingeRow_swap` → slot
  core `chainData_freshEdge_slot_mem` → P3 seed bridge → `chainData_freshEdge_slot_perp` per surviving edge.
  **GATES ON THE `hφ` SEAM:** takes the base redundancy `hφ` at the RELABELLED `endsσρ` base (the slot core's
  one-selector framing) + the perp data at the UN-relabelled `ends₀`. A correct lemma, NOT vacuous — but its
  `hφ`@`endsσρ` slot is the member-mapping wall (design §(o‴)(I.8.12)). The shell does NOT supply `hφ`@`endsσρ`
  by transport — there is no clean leaf, and **ROUTE α (the per-step fold to re-architect the slot core onto
  `hφ`@`ends₀`) is INFEASIBLE** (§(o‴)(I.8.15)); the route is under user/coordinator adjudication.
- **`i3_candidateBlock_transport_deRisk`** (`Relabel.lean:4383`) + **`ofNormals_supportExtensor_relabel_perm`**
  (`Relabel.lean:63`) — STAND: the support-extensor relabel identity `candidate.supp f = base.supp (shiftEdgePerm
  i f)`. STEP 2 reuses this identity ONCE (applied to a single perp), so it stays load-bearing; only its
  all-`i`/`∀ j` *family*-lift (T-1) is orphaned.
- **`chainData_freshEdge_perp_of_witness`** (`Relabel.lean`) — per-vertex form (STANDS; the arm threads the
  base-redundancy lemma above, not this).
- **Chain-induction LEAVES 1–4** (`Relabel.lean`, the eq-(6.44) regroup off the single base redundancy):
  `interiorGroup_acolumn_adjacency` (step kernel, deg-2 column cancellation) + `anchor_group_acolumn_eq_baseRedundancy`
  (base case `P(2)` at `vtx 2`, degree-ONE in `G−v₁`) + `interior_group_eq_baseRedundancy` (`Nat.le_induction`;
  every interior edge-group's tail column = the anchor's; `hcol ∀a` replaced by endpoint id `hab₁`/`hab₂` —
  jointly contradictory with `hcomb` for `r̂≠0`) + `interior_group_acolumn_eq_neg_baseRedundancy` (consumer
  reading: tail column `= −ρ₀`). Plus the framework-free primitives `hingeRow_comp_single_endpoint_flip` +
  `edgeGroup_comp_single_endpoint_flip`, `edgeIndexedCombination_comp_single_{off,eq_incident}`.
- **P3 seed bridge `shiftSeedAdv_eq_funLeft_shiftPerm`** (+ helper `shiftSeedAdv_eq_prod_shiftSeedSwap`,
  `Relabel.lean`) — the fold seed `shiftSeedAdv q (i−1)` = engine seed `qρ` (KT eq. 6.56).
- **LEAF-ρ1 algebraic core `wstep_foldl_hingeRow_telescope`** (+ helpers `wstep_hingeRow_off`/`_frontier`,
  `Relabel.lean`) — the general-`i` closed form of the W9a `wstep` foldl = `(∑_{s<m} hingeRow wₛ wₛ₊₁ ρ₀) +
  hingeRow w_m w_{m+2} ρ₀` (`m=i−1`, KT eq. 6.66); + its membership corollary `wstep_foldl_freshEdge_slot_mem`.
  **P1 LANDED:** both restated over `Set.InjOn w (Set.Iic (m+2))` (the dead `Function.Injective (ℕ→α)` is
  `False` over `[Finite α]`); the arm supplies `hinj` from `cd.vtx_inj` via `Set.InjOn.mono`.
- **LEAF-ρ2 `shiftBodyListAsc_relabel_foldl_hingeRow`** + the G1 bridges
  `shiftPerm_eq_prod_map_swap_shiftBodyListAsc` (`Operations.lean`) / `wstep_foldl_funLeft_eq` (`Relabel.lean`) —
  the relabel-only ascending foldl = inverse-cycle relabelled hinge row.
- **A-1 `exists_candidateRow_bottomRows_of_rigidOn`** (`Candidate.lean`) + `chainData_split_w6b_gates`
  (`Realization.lean`) — the W6b producer outputs the eq-(6.52) `λ`-grouped `(ab)`-edge witness `lamAB`/`rab`
  AND (after the a′-i signature change) the candidate row `hρGv` in **edge-grouped** form (via
  `exists_edgeIndexed_combination_of_mem_span_rigidityRows`, `Basic.lean`). **At the BASE `G−v₁` only** (the
  row-352 gap). The `(b,a)` branch negates `rab → −rab` (W8 sign-swap).
- **A-2 carrier `candidate_perp_two_incident_panels`** (+ the `supportExtensor`-perp form
  `candidate_perp_two_incident_supportExtensors`, `Relabel.lean`) — the interior-vertex eq-(6.44) perp carry:
  the common candidate `r̂ := ∑λab•rab` ⊥ both incident chain-edge panels (⊥ `C_c` direct; ⊥ `C_d` via
  `candidateRow_ac_eq_neg` `rAC=−r̂`).
- **A-3 `freshEdge_surviving_row_mem_of_witness`** (`Relabel.lean`) — the single-vertex composition feeding the
  A-1 witness through A-2 to discharge `freshEdge_surviving_row_mem`'s `hperp` for real.
- **`panelCorrespondence_supportExtensor`** + **`candidate_supportExtensor_perp_of_base`** (`Relabel.lean`) —
  option-(a′) panel-correspondence transport identity (general-`i`): candidate-`i`.`supportExtensor (edge s)`
  = `v₁`-base.`supportExtensor (shiftEdgePerm i (edge s))`, and the perp transports across it
  (`rw [panelCorrespondence_supportExtensor]; exact hperp`). **The per-summand transport the row-352 leaf
  threads.** + `edgeGroup_acolumn_mem_block` (column-in-block core).
- **The W9a fold** (`seedAdvance_wstep_hstep` + `wstep_foldl_mem_span_rigidityRows` +
  `shiftBodyListAsc_foldl_mem_span_rigidityRows`); **seed half** `seedShift_inv_cancel` / `seedShift_off_cycle`;
  the inverse-cycle action lemmas (4 `shiftPerm_inv_*` + 7 `shiftEdgePerm_inv_*`); `ofNormals_supportExtensor_relabel_perm`
  (the `hsupp_of` foundation); `removeVertex_genuine_shiftRelabel` (the genuine-link transport crux);
  `blockRow_relabel_perm`; `rigidityRow_relabel_{off_cycle,to_genuine}`. `ChainData` + accessors
  (`Operations.lean`); **2c-i** `exists_chainData_discriminator_pick`; **2c-ii-α** `ChainData.shiftPerm` (KT
  6.54); **2c-ii-graphiso** `splitOff_isLink_shiftRelabel_iff` + `shiftEdgePerm`.

**Orphan / confirm-and-delete (`git grep` zero callers at the delete commit):**
- **STAND (Route W building blocks, NOT delete):** `freshEdge_surviving_row_mem_of_witness` (A-2) /
  `candidate_perp_two_incident_*` / `panelCorrespondence_supportExtensor` / `candidate_supportExtensor_perp_of_base`;
  `freshEdge_surviving_row_mem` (the perp-half builder); the telescope
  (`wstep_foldl_hingeRow_telescope` / `_freshEdge_slot_mem`); the `acolumn_..._sup_...` crux; A-1/A-2/`_of_witness`;
  `candidateRow_ac_eq_neg` (Leaf B re-consumes it).
- **Orphaned-for-the-arm (confirm-and-delete at the arm-build commit):** **DOWNGRADED — confirm-and-delete
  CANDIDATE, NOT confirmed orphan, pending the corrected-crux resolution (§(o‴)(I.8.19)-ADDENDUM(D); LEAF C
  REFUTED):** the seed-advancing `hφ`-spine subtree — the slot core `chainData_freshEdge_slot_mem`, the fold
  spine `shiftBodyListAsc_foldl_mem_span_rigidityRows`, the seed-advancing gate
  `funLeft_dualMap_sub_acolumn_seedAdvance_mem_span_rigidityRows` + its `shiftBodyFrameworkAsc*`/`shiftSeedAdv`
  scaffolding, and `chainData_relabel_arm_hρGv`. It is sole-caller-chained into the to-be-replaced arm, but
  CANNOT be declared orphaned while the whole-matrix route is unsettled — if the corrected crux reduces to the
  KT-(6.66) carry, the perp sub-tree (`_slot_perp` / `_perp_of_baseRedundancy` / LEAF-1–4 chain induction /
  the telescope) that encodes eq.~(6.44) is REUSED, not deleted. Confirm-and-delete only at a route-SETTLE
  commit. The single-step carrier W9a `funLeft_dualMap_sub_acolumn_mem_span_rigidityRows`
  (`:865`) STAYS regardless (d=3 building block). **The ROUTE-α leaf 1**
  `Graph.ChainData.shiftEndsAdv` + `shiftEndsAdv_zero`/`shiftEndsAdv_succ` (`Relabel.lean:1731`) — the
  abandoned per-step selector accumulator (ROUTE α INFEASIBLE, §(o‴)(I.8.15); the per-step fold can't reach the
  cycle edge relabel, so this def has no consumer). **T-1/T-2**
  `chainData_candidateRow_edgeGrouped_transport_{blocks,comb}` (`Relabel.lean:4427`/`:4464`) — the row-354
  family-transport plan, MIS-TARGETED vs the consumer (design §(o‴)(I.8.11); the corrected route transports a
  single scalar perp, never the family). T-3 (`…_transport_links`) was never built → MOOTED. (The anchor
  `i3_candidateBlock_transport_deRisk` + `ofNormals_supportExtensor_relabel_perm` STAND — STEP 2 reuses them.)
  The split→split `rigidityRow_chainData_relabel` / `rigidityRow_relabel_perm` (rows 288/291, wrong graph level,
  §(o‴)(I.5)); the candidate→base T-W9a fold `shiftBodyList_foldr_…` (wrong orientation, H.10); the two block
  bricks `rigidityRow_relabel_to_block{,_swap}` (the assembly inlined the wrap-block); `ofNormals_relabel_perm`
  + the binary `…comp…` (docstring-referenced — sync on delete); the per-`i`-W6b
  `chainData_split_realization`/`_w6b_gates` (Fix B; re-check at 2c-iii). **DELETED 2026-06-19:** the 5-decl W9b
  per-body chain (§(o‴)(I.1), machine-refuted).

**FIX-FORK SETTLED (§(o‴)(H), 2026-06-19, adversarially verified (H.10)) — corrected Fix A buildable:** keep
the shared `ρ₀`, transport memberships **base→candidate** (relabel `(shiftPerm i)⁻¹`, seed advancing). Fix B
(per-`i` re-seed) INFEASIBLE (breaks KT's single-`r` existence). The genuine-row `hwmem` transport is a
removeVertex-level **per-row case-split** (NOT the split→split graph-iso, NOT a W9a span fold which needs
*literal* rows). The landed candidate→base T-W9a/W9b folds are orphaned-for-the-arm (`wstep` non-invertible).
Full reasoning + KT deciding lines = design §(o‴)(H)/(H.10).

      **LANDED/CLOSED 2026-06-18.** Remaining: **CHAIN-2c — the single-base `Fin (k+1)` family dispatch** (route
      β): ONE base, ONE `ρ₀`, ONE discriminator → `fin_cases u`; eq. (6.66) absorbed. **2c-i** LANDED. **2c-ii**
      (the genuinely-new relabel arm — KT's `ρᵢ` is a `(i−1)`-cycle): foundation LANDED; FIX-FORK SETTLED. The
      perp slot was ROUTE-SETTLED (STEP-1-at-base + STEP-2 scalar transport, both LANDED; T-1/T-2 ORPHANED).
      **The `hρGv` slot `chainData_relabel_arm_hρGv` LANDED but exposed the `hφ` SEAM** — its slot core wants
      the base redundancy at the artifact `(endsσρ, q)`, A-1 gives it at the base `(ends₀, q)`. ALL LOCAL
      ROUTES DEAD (ROUTE α §(o‴)(I.8.15), `hφ`-at-source B1 §(o‴)(I.8.16/17), both fold re-shapes
      §(o‴)(I.8.18)); the artifact is a Lean-MODELLING choice of the seed-advancing fold. **The whole-matrix
      re-architecture (§(o‴)(I.8.18)'s unblock) was decomposed (§(o‴)(I.8.19)), its LEAF C ("re-fire A-1 at the
      candidate") REFUTED (§(o‴)(I.8.19)-ADDENDUM: A-1 existential in `ρ`, the dispatch needs a SINGLE shared
      `ρ0`), and the residual question (can the column-op carry the FIXED `ρ0`?) ADJUDICATED AGAINST the route:
      ROUTE DIES, IT IS THE WALL (§(o‴)(I.8.20), KT pp. 696–698 read directly).** KT's (6.61) containment is
      relabel-MEDIATED on both axes ((6.62) "column correspondence follows from `ρᵢ`"; the redundant row MOVES
      `(v₀v₂)ᵢ∗ ⇔ (v₀v₁)ᵢ∗`), so the column-op offers ONLY the member-MOVING relabel-image transport (=
      `chainData_bottom_relabel`); the FIXED-member inclusion is FALSE/unbuilt-and-not-KT's; the (6.66) carry is
      the seed-advancing telescope (moved member). F4 RE-CONFIRMED (CHAIN-1 = LI, span only in `hdiff`). **NEXT
      = USER ADJUDICATION OF A FORK, NOT a build** (see *Hand-off*): (B) carry `ρ0`/`hφ@endsσρ` to ENTRY
      (LIKELY-DEAD, the wall relocates unless ENTRY re-derives the redundancy NATIVELY against `endsσρ`), or a
      re-scoped Lean-architecture rethink (carry abstract `r ∈ ℝ^D` + the `Mᵢ`-block FORM, not a transported
      fixed dual-vector). **NO C.0–C.6 / motive change** (machinery below dispatch C.3 + record C.1). **NO decl
      orphaned by §I.8.20** (the `hφ`-spine + perp/telescope are confirm-and-delete CANDIDATEs; route B may
      reuse the telescope at ENTRY; confirm-and-delete at the route-SETTLE = user's fork choice). Once the fork
      settles → arm shell + **2c-iii** `chainData_dispatch`. d=3 M₃ = `i=2` (no `hφ` slot, no fold) —
      zero-regression unaffected.

      LOCKED 2026-06-19; gated on ENTRY's extractor reshape, lands at the front of 23c=ENTRY — 23b closes
      green-modulo `hdispatch`). Replace `case_III_candidate_dispatch`; feed the (general-`k`) arm closers.
      **Signature FROZEN** by the CHAIN↔ENTRY contract (C.3): `hdispatch` consumes a `G.ChainData n` record +
      the `splitOff (vtx 1)(vtx 0)(vtx 2) e₀` deficiency-0 fact + the IH-generic base realization. Keep the
      `d=3` dispatch as a `k=2`/length-3 wrapper (C.4 zero-regression).

## Blockers / open questions

The OD resolutions (full text in `notes/Phase23-design.md` §"CHAIN"(e)/(g)):

- **OD-8 — RESOLVED 2026-06-17** (route α, `complementIso` = the O(n)-natural Hodge `⋆`; β rejected). §"CHAIN"(h).
- **OD-6 — DECIDED:** five leaves within ONE sub-phase 23b (the arm engine is already general-`k`).
- **OD-7 — DECIDED + CLOSED:** the four 23a producers folded into CHAIN's tail; all general-`k`.
- **OD-4 — RESOLVED 2026-06-18:** existence/homogeneous route, alg-independence NOT forced — the eq.-(6.67)
  D-span runs off `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` (linear independence of `d+1` homogeneous vectors, via Lemma
  2.1, not KT's affine points). §(i).
- **(b) producer-shape — SETTLED 2026-06-17:** the `G.ChainData n` interface frozen, no motive/IH change (C.6),
  `d=3` zero-regression wrapper (C.4: chain `v₀v₁v₂v₃ = b—v—a—c`). §"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract".
- **OD-1 (still open — ENTRY's to resolve at build, C.5).** KT Lemma 5.4 short-cycle base is a real branch of
  the general-`d` chain entry (unlike `d=3`'s inline triangle floor); whether the dispatch assumes the chain
  branch (ENTRY discharging the cycle branch) is invariant for CHAIN-5's signature.

## Hand-off / next phase

**23b is CLOSED — the live hand-off is `notes/Phase23c.md`.** The CHAIN target (`chainData_dispatch`) was not
reached: the `hρGv`-seam is a hard core (the member-mapping wall, **intrinsic to KT** — §(o‴)(I.8.18)–(I.8.20),
all four route families dead and adversarially verified). Carried to 23c: the unfinished CHAIN tail (the
`hρGv` Case-III chain arm + `chainData_dispatch` (2c-iii) + CHAIN-5), the **redundancy-carry architectural
decision** that gates the arm (the (A) KT-faithful matrix/abstract-`r` rethink vs (B) ENTRY-carry fork — 23c's
first deliverable, a feasibility recon), the **ENTRY** obligation (reshape `Graph.exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`,
`Reduction.lean:383`, to the `G.ChainData n` producer `exists_chainData_of_noRigid`; KT Lemma 4.6 chain +
Lemma 4.8 split-off at general `d`; lift the `6 ≤ bodyBarDim n` floor; OD-1 chain/cycle dichotomy is C.5,
ENTRY's to resolve; the only consumer is `case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k`, `Arms.lean:777`), and **ASSEMBLY**
(Theorem 5.5 → re-green `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` + `hub` → Thm 5.6 → Conjecture 1.2). The CHAIN↔ENTRY
`G.ChainData n` contract stays **FROZEN** (design §"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract", C.0–C.6; no motive/IH change). The
blueprint-clarity obligation (the `lem:case-III` general-`d` node must materialize KT's isos 6.54–6.56 + the
±r chain 6.66 + — per the `BlueprintExposition.md` sharpening — the abstract-`r`/moving-member shape, flagging
the fixed-functional-transport trap) is carried in `notes/Phase23c.md`, written at phase-close. Audit trail of
the dead routes: design §(o‴)(I.8.12)/(I.8.15)–(I.8.20).

## Decisions made during this phase

(Settled entries are one-line verdicts: decision + Lean name. Proof techniques live in git + `notes/FRICTION.md`
+ the design doc §"CHAIN"(f)/(g)/(h) + §"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract". The forward detail — route to close the open
leaves — is in *Current state* / *Hand-off* above. The opening recon's decisions — OD-6/OD-7 resolved, OD-4 +
(b) flagged — live in design §"CHAIN"(e); the chain-data contract in §"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract".)

### Phase-local choices and proof techniques

- **Opened on a leaf-level recon, not a build** — found the arm-engine already general-`k`, only the dispatch
  `d=3`; surfaced flag (b) → §"CHAIN"(a)–(e).
- **CHAIN↔ENTRY chain-data contract settled** — `G.ChainData n` structure + producer/`hdispatch` signatures;
  no motive/IH change (clause ii) → §"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract" C.0–C.6.
- **CHAIN-3-finish recon: the `⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line route, NOT the d=3 `Φ̃` route**
  (`finrank_sup_range_wedgeFixedLeft` / `extensor_toDual_extensor_eq_zero_of_perp` withdrawn, kept green as the
  d=3 wrapper) → §"CHAIN"(f) (+ *Coordinator KT-route check*).
- **OD-8 RESOLVED: route α (`complementIso` O(n)-equivariance, the Hodge `⋆`); β rejected** (the withdrawn
  `dim Φ̃` count) → §"CHAIN"(h).
- **OD-4 RESOLVED 2026-06-18: existence/homogeneous route, alg-independence NOT forced** (overturns "forced").
  The eq.-(6.67) D-span runs off `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top` (linear independence of `d+1` homogeneous
  vectors, via Lemma 2.1) — never KT's affine points. Source-verified vs KT p.698; the row #106 cross-product
  construction is dead. CHAIN-4 decomposed 4a–4d → §"CHAIN"(i)/(j).
- **CHAIN-2 decomposition (recon 2026-06-18) — overturns §(c)'s framing.** The
  `caseIIICandidate`/`case_III_old_new_blocks`/`case_III_rank_certification` chain is already general-`k` (the
  only `d=3`-pin in `CaseIII/` is the dispatch = CHAIN-5). CHAIN-2 = the `Fin d`-indexed reduction *layer* (2a /
  2b / 2c) → §"CHAIN"(l).
- **CHAIN-2a design-pass + CLOSED 2026-06-18 — VERDICT: re-index, gates threaded from above.** The per-`i`
  reduction is a `case_III_arm_realization` re-index, not from-scratch gate construction; the gate family is
  carried as hypotheses and supplied by two general-`k` producers (W6b + CHAIN-4d discriminator). Two
  axiom-clean leaves: `chainData_split_w6b_gates` + `chainData_split_realization`; the transversal half stays
  `htrans` (CHAIN-2c fills via the discriminator). → §"CHAIN"(m).
- **CHAIN-2b/2c design-pass 2026-06-18 — VERDICT: single-base `Fin (k+1)` dispatch (route β), ±r chain absorbed
  (no separate 2b lemma).** Route β LOCKED (user-adjudicated, row 242). § design (n).
- **The bottom-family-transport recon trail** (route B per-body W9b fold → telescoping pass ruled it dead →
  pair recon refuted the forward whole-relabel → §(o‴)(H) corrected Fix A) lives in design §(o)–(o‴)(H.10) +
  git; the live verdict is in *Current state* (FIX-FORK SETTLED).
- **FIX-FORK SETTLED 2026-06-19 (§(o‴)(H)/(H.10)) — corrected Fix A; Fix B INFEASIBLE.** Keep the shared `ρ₀`,
  invert to `(shiftPerm i)⁻¹` (cancels the seed, matches KT (6.62)); Fix B breaks KT's single-`r` existence.
  Re-author the transport base→candidate directly (re-fold opposite order, seed advancing) — the landed
  candidate→base T-W9a/W9b folds are orphaned-for-the-arm. No motive/IH/spine change.
- **W9b per-body chain DELETED 2026-06-19 (§(o‴)(I.1)).** Removed the 5-decl dead cluster from `Relabel.lean`
  (`git grep` zero callers); §(o‴)(I.1) showed the per-body block transport cannot terminate at the chain
  interior. Build green + lint clean. Kept `candidateRow_ac_eq_neg` (Leaf B re-consumes it).
- **2c-ii-arm `hwmem` transport bricks all LANDED 2026-06-19/20 (axiom-clean).** The genuine-row `hwmem`
  disjunct is a removeVertex-level per-row case-split (generalizing `case_III_bottom_relabel`, NOT a split
  graph-iso, NOT a W9b fold; §(o‴)(I.5)/(I.6)). Landed: 3 genuine-row branches, both block-orientation bricks,
  the `hsupp_of` foundation `ofNormals_supportExtensor_relabel_perm`, the make-or-break
  `removeVertex_genuine_shiftRelabel`, the per-member assembly `chainData_bottom_relabel`, the `hρGv` G1
  bridges, LEAF-ρ2. Lessons → TACTICS-QUIRKS §38 / GOLF §20 / FRICTION idioms.
- **`hρGv` algebraic core + chain-induction LANDED 2026-06-20 (all axiom-clean; detail = §(o‴)(I.7.10)/(I.8) +
  git + Lean docstrings):** LEAF-ρ1 closed-form telescope `wstep_foldl_hingeRow_telescope` (an EXACT closed-form
  sum, KT eq. 6.66) + the membership corollary `wstep_foldl_freshEdge_slot_mem`; **P1** finite-range restatement
  over `Set.InjOn w (Set.Iic (m+2))`; the P2 two-edge column crux `acolumn_mem_hingeRowBlock_sup_of_span_rigidityRows`
  + the general-`i` surviving-row builder `freshEdge_surviving_row_mem`; A-2 carrier
  `candidate_perp_two_incident_{panels,supportExtensors}` (Route A — the perp from the eq-6.52 `r̂`, NOT
  arbitrary `ρ₀`; the refuted generic-`ρ₀` isolated implication `ρ₀_perp_interior_chain_edge` lived in the
  vacuous `=⊤` sup); A-1 W6b witness re-thread; A-3 single-vertex composition
  `freshEdge_surviving_row_mem_of_witness`.
- **`hρGv` Route W LOCKED via the i=3 de-risk fork (2026-06-20).** The all-`i`-lift de-risk
  `i3_freshEdge_interior_acolumn_sup_deRisk` (axiom-clean) RAN → at honest `i=3` the interior `vtx 1` is
  GENUINELY degree-2 in `Fva = G−vtx 3` (both edges survive), so the column lands in the **sup** `block(e0)⊔block(e1)`,
  NOT a single block — the d=3 M₃ single-block route does NOT generalize → **Route W (per-vertex witness, KT eq.
  6.66) FORCED** → option (a′) (re-derive at base `G₁`, transport the perp to `G−vᵢ`). The panel-correspondence
  de-risk + `panelCorrespondence_supportExtensor` + `candidate_supportExtensor_perp_of_base` made (a′)
  buildable. §(o‴)(I.8.7)/(I.8.8).
- **Chain-induction design-settle + LEAVES 1–4 LANDED 2026-06-20 (axiom-clean).** A recon pair (rows 339–341)
  refuted the leaf-2 per-vertex `group = ±ρ₀` pin → the genuine KT-6.66 mechanism is an eq-(6.44) chain
  induction off the *single* base redundancy (`candidateRow_ac_eq_neg` gives only per-vertex adjacency
  `(ac)-group = −(ab)-group`; KT's `±r` is a chain of `d−2` cancellations anchored at the head). Pinned 5-leaf
  plan (anchor `v₂`); LEAVES 1–4 + the witness-free `chainData_freshEdge_perp_of_baseRedundancy` landed.
  Corrective: `hcol ∀a` is jointly contradictory with `hcomb` for `r̂≠0` → replaced by endpoint id; the deeper
  step derives column-vanishing internally. §(o‴)(I.8.9-SETTLE).
- **PERP-SLOT route SETTLED + LANDED 2026-06-21 (axiom-clean; rows 352–360, design §(o‴)(I.8.10)/(I.8.11)).**
  The 2nd level/shape mismatch (the perp slot wanted the redundancy at a framework A-1 gives only at the base):
  the row-354 T-1/T-2/T-3 *family* transport was MIS-TARGETED (re-indexed breaks `hcomb`: `σ.symm v₂ = v₁ ≠ v₂`;
  un-relabelled breaks `hrv`). CORRECT route (KT works entirely at the base): the LANDED perp leaf
  `chainData_freshEdge_perp_of_baseRedundancy` at base index `⟨1⟩` (STEP 1, no transport) + ONE scalar perp
  transport `chainData_freshEdge_perp_transport_base_to_candidate` (STEP 2, base@`edge(s+1)` → candidate@`edge s`,
  via `ofNormals_supportExtensor_relabel_perm` — support extensors are graph-independent) composed as
  `chainData_freshEdge_slot_perp`. T-1/T-2 ORPHANED; the anchor `i3_candidateBlock_transport_deRisk` +
  `ofNormals_supportExtensor_relabel_perm` STAND. The `hρGv` slot `chainData_relabel_arm_hρGv` then assembled
  (`hingeRow_swap` → slot core → P3 → the perp composition). Friction: `show … from hid` for an omega side-goal
  over `↑(⟨(i:ℕ),_⟩ : Fin (cd.d+1))` (TACTICS-QUIRKS § 63).
- **`hφ`-SEAM ROUTE TRAIL — ALL LOCAL ROUTES DEAD (design §(o‴)(I.8.12)–(I.8.17); one-line verdicts, full
  Lean-grounded arcs in the design doc + git).** The slot core demands `hφ` at the artifact `(endsσρ,q)`, A-1
  gives `(ends₀,q)` (the member-mapping wall). ROUTE α (per-step selector fold) INFEASIBLE — the gate
  (`Relabel.lean:1201`) can't accumulate to the cycle `shiftEdgePerm i` (I.8.12/I.8.15); `hφ`-at-source
  (re-thread the W6b producer to output `hφ@endsσρ`, the 3b shape) SCOPED feasible-but-contract-touching
  (I.8.16) then its B1 span re-derivation spike BLOCKED (I.8.17). The live verdict is the I.8.18 entry below.
- **SLOT-CORE/ASSEMBLY RE-ARCHITECTURE ADJUDICATION 2026-06-21 (design §(o‴)(I.8.18); Lean-grounded, docs-only)
  — VERDICT: BOTH local fold re-shapes DEAD; the unblock is a KT-faithful ASSEMBLY-level re-write, machinery
  BELOW the contract → USER SCOPE CALL (A: assembly recon RECOMMENDED; B: carry to ENTRY, LIKELY-DEAD).**
  Re-confirmed the artifact premise against the LANDED engine/slot-core/A-1 (the engine's single-`(Gv,ends,q)`
  slot-binding × the slot core's one-`ends` parametricity force `hφ`@`(endsσρ,q)`). (1) selector+seed lockstep
  — DEAD (gate's `{edge(s+1),edge(s+2)}` window ≠ the `edge 0`/`e₀`-moving cycle `shiftEdgePerm i`); (2) `hφ` at
  `(endsσρ,qρ)`/`(ends₀,q)` directly — DEAD (the member-mapping wall / = (1)). KT eqs. 6.60→6.64 use a
  whole-matrix column-op reframe (TWO frameworks, never the hybrid); the artifact is the Lean's seed-advancing
  materialized fold. The re-architecture forces NO C.0–C.6 / motive change (infra below dispatch C.3 + record
  C.1; the I.8.16 C.0 delta evaporates).
- **WHOLE-MATRIX RE-ARCHITECTURE — LEAF C REFUTED 2026-06-21 (design §(o‴)(I.8.19)-ADDENDUM; coordinator-
  verified verbatim; docs-only). VERDICT: the I.8.19 "buildable" decomposition is RETRACTED; NEXT is a DESIGN
  QUESTION, not a build.** LEAF C ("re-fire A-1 at the candidate") re-introduces the rejected Fix B: A-1 is
  existential in `ρ` (`Candidate.lean:414`), but the dispatch fires it ONCE at the base → SINGLE shared `ρ0`
  (`Realization.lean:388–411`), discriminator ONCE on `ρ0` (`:439–441`, single-`r`, KT eq. 6.66). Tying the
  fresh `ρ_cand` to `ρ0` = the dead member-mapping wall or the (6.66) carry → LEAF C relocates the seam.
  Corrected crux = a NEW fixed-`ρ0` span-inclusion `span(R(G₁,q₁)-rows) ⊆ span(R(G,pᵢ)-rows)` via column-op
  (6.60→6.64), which CHAIN-1 does NOT supply (F4 — LI, not span); OPEN whether it escapes the §I.8.18 fold-form
  wall. F1/F2 survive (necessary-not-sufficient); LEAF A independently fine; no decl orphaned.
- **CHAIN-3 cleanup item (2) DONE 2026-06-20 — `finrank_toDualPerp_pair_eq` factored** (`MeetHodge.lean`,
  axiom-clean): the byte-identical ~55-line `finrank {n}^⊥ = k` metric transport (duplicated between (h-3)/(h-4))
  dropped to one shared helper (~110 lines of duplication removed).

### Landed CHAIN-1/3/4/OD-7 bricks (all CLOSED 2026-06-18, axiom-clean; canonical homes = git + design §(f)/(h)/(i)/(j)/(k) + the BlueprintExposition CHAIN-3 entry)

One-line verdicts (closed forward sequence, nothing downstream leans on the internals): **CHAIN-1**
(`Basic.lean`) the eq.-6.62 row-swap + `ιc`-block augment, graph-free over `ScrewSpace k`. **CHAIN-3**
(`Meet`/`MeetHodge.lean`) the `⋀^{d−1}W`-is-a-line duality. **CHAIN-4** (`Claim612.lean`) the discriminator (4d's
`MeetHodge` import did NOT regress the `⋀²ℝ⁴` proofs; 4b stays its own green body). **OD-7** (the four producers
+ both M4 halves general-`k`): verbatim numeral passes (§58 idiom) except LEAF-0
`linearIndependent_normals_of_algebraicIndependent_triple` (genuinely-new); the M4-forget reach-in routes
solely through CHAIN-3 (h-4) + `extensor_update_smul`.

### Promoted to TACTICS-GOLF / TACTICS-QUIRKS / FRICTION / DESIGN

- *Match the list recursor to which end the fold's base case sits on: a `foldl`/accumulating fold anchored at
