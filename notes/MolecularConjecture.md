# Molecular Conjecture — cross-phase program plan

**Status:** IN PROGRESS. Phases 17–20 + 21a complete (`M(G̃)`,
deficiency, `k`-dof, def = corank bridge, the Theorem-4.9 combinatorial
induction, and the Grassmann–Cayley meet all green; see
`notes/Phase19.md`, `notes/Phase20.md`, `notes/Phase21a.md`). Phase 21
(algebraic induction) is **complete, GREEN-modulo-21b**: all
genericity-free content green (panel layer, Theorem 5.5, Cases I/II, the
analytic half of Prop 1.1), with the shared analytic crux Claim 6.4/6.9
(the genericity device) scoped out into its own sub-phase **Phase 21b**,
entering each consuming node as an explicit hypothesis (risk #4/#7 +
`DESIGN.md` *Genericity device (Claim 6.4/6.9) is its own sub-phase
(Phase 21b)*). **Phase 21b is complete** (closed 2026-06-04): it delivered
the genericity device, the genericity-free accounting iffs, and the
`V(G)`-relative count bridges. A math-first feasibility pass against KT
§6.2–6.3 then **re-scoped the realization *producers* to Phases 22–23** and
corrected the case-naming — **the project's reducible-vertex split
(`theorem_55`'s `hsplit`, k=0) is KT Case III, not Case II** (it is one row
short of full rank via eq. (6.12) and needs the Lemma 6.10/6.13 redundant-edge
row); only the rigid-subgraph contraction (Case I) reaches full rank. The KT
math for both producers is worked out in `notes/Phase21b.md` *Finding A/B* +
*Hand-off to Phases 22–23* and folded into the *Phase 22+* plan below.
**Phase 22 (the realization layer) is sub-lettered.** Opened as a single Phase 22
on 2026-06-04, it was split the same day because it over-broadly bundled three
independent bodies of work; sub-lettering (22a, 22b, …) keeps the integer phase
numbers 23–26 stable. **Phase 22a is complete** (Case I
realization, KT §6.2; see `notes/Phase22a.md`): the composer
`PanelHingeFramework.case_I_realization` (`lem:case-I-realization`) discharges
`theorem_55`'s Case-I branch, delivered via the **block-triangular
reframe**: KT eq. (6.3)'s rank-addition over one common framework
`ofNormals G ends q₀`, routed through the genericity device's independent-row count
(the H-block edges ⊔ the surviving edges made independent by the exterior-column
projection), not a common-seed splice. It shipped green-modulo a single dischargeable
hypothesis = KT **Claim 6.4** (`lem:claim-6-4`, the surviving block's exterior-projected
rank at the generic placement, KT eqs. (6.5)/(6.9)), **fully discharged in Phase 22b**
(so `lem:case-I-realization` is now fully green). The phase's cross-cutting lesson — a formalization must reproduce
the source's argument **structure**, not just its conclusion — surfaced from the
hpinc→asymmetric→block-triangular→Qc-non-root design arc (the common-seed splice
type-checked but kept needing undischargeable bridge hypotheses) and is promoted to
`DESIGN.md` *Match the source's argument structure, not just its conclusion*. The
full Case-I brick inventory (N4 contraction-minimality bridge via the Whitney-style
sub-build N4a→N4b→N4c, the N5 splice/seed/rank-polynomial bricks, N6a/N6b/N6c, the
two-motive split, the generic-motive induction G2a–c / G3a–c) + decision history
live in `notes/Phase22a.md`. **Phase 22b is complete** (closed 2026-06-05): KT Claim 6.4 — the discharge of 22a's
green-modulo obligation — is **fully discharged** (`lem:claim-6-4` green), so
`lem:case-I-realization` is fully green. The reduction N-22b-1/2/3 cut Claim 6.4 to the single
hypothesis `htransport`; the discharge then built the three composing bricks (U3a the relabel-leg
rigidity transport; **U3b** the genuine crux — the exterior-column projection loses zero rank on a
rigid block, via `Z ⊔ range(extProj) = ⊤` whose one real-content input is the rigid-block pin-count;
U2/U1 the collapse-relabel projected-row reproduction at KT eq. (6.7)'s degenerate placement) and the
route-(i) motive strengthening (the link-recording conjunct, discharging the selector alignment),
composed by the capstone U4 producer `rigidContract_exterior_rank_transport_htransport`. The
course-correction discipline (the crux moved U2→U3, then U3a was found not a leaf) + design arc
(`notes/Phase22-realization-design.md` §1.14–§1.24) are in `notes/Phase22b.md`.
**Phase 22c is in progress** (opened 2026-06-05, design-pass-first): Case III at
`d=3` (KT §6.4.1, Lemma 6.10) — the `theorem_55.hsplit` producer at `k=0`, the
conjecture's crux. Opened on a **layer-level design recon, not a build** (Case I
burned ~10 node-by-node commits before a layer pass surfaced the binding gap;
`DESIGN.md` *Scale-up: design the LAYER, not just the node*). The `d=3` assembly
(`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` `hub` + `thm:theorem-55` flip + the Case-I wiring)
is the **likely Phase 22d, deferred** until 22c's shape is clear.
Phases 23–26 planned. This is the program design for Phases 17–26 and the runbook for
threading the remaining phases.
**Audience:** the agent picking up the molecular-conjecture program.
Read this after `ROADMAP.md` (which carries the one-paragraph program
summary + status row); this file is the lemma-level detail.

When opening or closing each remaining phase, follow the top-level
`CLAUDE.md` *When this commit opens / closes a phase* protocol — and
**keep this doc current as part of it** (its phase table, the per-phase
detail block, and *Opening the next phase*). This cross-phase program doc
is gated by no CI/checkdecls check, so it drifts unless synced at every
molecular phase boundary (it did, pre-21b). Per-phase blueprint nodes go
in that phase's chapter (`extensor.tex` / `rigidity-matrix.tex` / …, or by
extending `algebraic-induction.tex` for the 21/22+ realization layer), not
a single `molecular.tex`.

The *detailed-exposition* deliverable for this program (spelling out the steps
KT's paper compresses, so each crux is followable end-to-end) is tracked in
`notes/BlueprintExposition.md` — the cross-phase ledger of hard nodes that earn
a full followable blueprint proof (most of its entries are
molecular: Lemma 2.1, Prop 1.1's two halves, the Thm-4.9 forest-surgery
track, the Case I/II/III cruxes). **Capture** a one-line entry there when a
node reroutes and surfaces a stable KT-math insight; **write** the prose at
that phase's close. Keep it current at each molecular boundary alongside this
doc (it is likewise gated by no CI check).

## The target

The **Molecular Conjecture** (Tay–Whiteley 1984, proved by
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011): a graph `G` can be realized as an
infinitesimally rigid **body-hinge** framework in `ℝᵈ` iff it can be
realized as an infinitesimally rigid **panel-hinge** framework in
`ℝᵈ`. Combined with the Tay–Whiteley body-hinge theorem (our Phase 16,
KT Proposition 1.1), this says: `G` has a rigid panel-hinge realization
iff `(D−1)·G` contains `D` edge-disjoint spanning trees, where
`D = (d+1 choose 2)`.

The hard content is that forcing the hinges at each body to be
**coplanar** (panel-hinge) does not drop the rank below the generic
body-hinge value. KT prove the strong quantitative form:

- **Theorem 5.5** (the heart): every *minimal `k`-dof-graph* `G` with
  `|V| ≥ 2` has a (nonparallel, if `G` simple) panel-hinge realization
  with `rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − k`.
- **Theorem 5.6**: every multigraph `G` has a panel-hinge realization
  with `rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)` — the conjecture, strong form.
- **Corollary 5.7** (the *molecule application*, requested in scope):
  for `G` with min degree ≥ 2, the rank of the 3-D generic bar-joint
  rigidity matroid of the square satisfies `r(G²) = 3|V| − 6 − def(G̃)`.

User-chosen scope (2026-06-02): **full conjecture + molecule
application**, with the molecule app **fully formalized** (not
citation-stubbed), built on a **full Grassmann–Cayley extensor
algebra** layer.

**The reference set is complete** — every source the program needs
(load-bearing, medium, and optional) is present in `.refs/` and
text-extractable. Nothing outstanding to acquire.

**OCR note.** [4] Crapo–Whiteley and `tay-whiteley-1985-generating-
isostatic` arrived as image-only scans (no text layer) and were OCR'd
in place on 2026-06-02 (`pymupdf` render at 300 dpi → `tesseract` 5.5.2
searchable PDF, replacing the scan losslessly). Both are *Structural
Topology* / *Topologie Structurale* journal articles with **side-by-
side English|French columns**; tesseract auto-detected the columns and
kept each contiguous (no interleaving), but only the `eng` language
pack is installed, so per page the text extracts as the full (eng-OCR'd,
imperfect) French column followed by the clean English column. Read the
English run; math symbols are imperfect (scan OCR) but the prose proof
structure is intact. To read a page via `pypdf`, expect French-then-
English ordering. Note: `.refs/` is gitignored, so these OCR'd PDFs are
local-only and not committed.

**Citation accuracy caveat (per `CLAUDE.md` *Referencing prior work*).**
Lemma 5.4 (cycle realizations) is cited by KT to [4] and [34]
(Whiteley, *Rigidity of molecular structures*, Kluwer 1999); verify the
exact proposition numbers in those sources before pinning a `§N` in the
blueprint. Cor 5.7's rank formula is Jackson–Jordán [13]'s result;
attribute it to them, with KT as the conjecture-resolving input.

## Proof architecture — five strata

In dependency order. The phase cuts follow these strata.

1. **Grassmann–Cayley / extensor algebra** (§2.1). Genuinely new linear
   algebra. Load-bearing fact: **Lemma 2.1** — the `D = (d+1 choose 2)`
   many `(d−1)`-extensors of `d+1` affinely independent points are
   linearly independent. Everything in Case III bottoms out here.
2. **The genuine panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)`** (§2.2–2.4).
   Honest geometry: `(d−2)`-affine-subspace hinges, the orthogonal-
   complement block `r(p(e))`, screw-center columns, `Z(G,p)`, trivial
   motions, the `rank ≤ D(|V|−1)` bound, degree of freedom, generic
   realizations. **Supersedes Phase 16's reduction-only
   `BodyHingeFramework`** and must be reconciled with it. Carries the
   three foundational rank lemmas 5.1/5.2/5.3.
3. **The matroid `M(G̃)` and `k`-dof combinatorics** (§2.5, §3).
   `D`-deficiency, `k`-dof / minimal `k`-dof-graphs, rigid subgraphs.
   `M(G̃)` is the `(D,D)` count matroid at the **boundary regime
   `ℓ = D = 2k`** — i.e. the `D`-fold graphic-matroid union + Tutte–
   Nash-Williams of **Phases 13–14**, NOT the `ℓ<2k` `CountMatroid.lean`.
4. **The combinatorial induction** (§4). Splitting-off / edge-splitting
   / rigid-subgraph contraction as graph operations; forest-surgery
   Lemmas 4.1/4.2 (hardest new pure combinatorics); the three-case
   decomposition; **Theorem 4.9**.
5. **The algebraic induction** (§5–6). Theorem 5.5 by induction on
   `|V|`: base + Case I (proper rigid subgraph, §6.2) + Case II (`k>0`
   splitting = Whiteley 1-extension, §6.3) + **Case III** (`k=0`, §6.4,
   the `D`-candidate-frameworks argument — "the most difficult case").
   Then Thm 5.6 → Conjecture 1.2, and (strata 6–7 below) the molecule
   application.

The **molecule application** (Cor 5.7) adds, on top:
6. **The 3-D generic bar-joint rigidity matroid** (linear-matroid form).
   Reuses the dimension-general `Framework V d` (Phase 4) + the
   `Matroid.ofFun` linear-matroid framing (Phase 8), specialized to
   `d = 3`. **NOT** a combinatorial (Laman-3D) characterization —
   KT §7 explicitly states that is an *open problem*. We only need the
   linear matroid and its rank `r(·)`.
7. **Projective duality + the molecule modelling equivalence**
   (Crapo–Whiteley [4]; Whiteley/Jackson–Jordán [13,37]): bar-joint of
   `G²` ↔ hinge-concurrent body-hinge of `G` ↔ (projective dual)
   panel-hinge of `G`. Then Cor 5.7 falls out of Thm 5.6.

## Phase breakdown (17–26)

| Phase | Content | KT § | Stratum |
|---|---|---|---|
| 17 ✓ | Grassmann–Cayley extensor algebra; **Lemma 2.1** | §2.1 | 1 |
| 18 ✓ | Genuine panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)`; Lemmas 5.1–5.3 (Prop 1.1 deferred to 19) | §2.2–2.4, parts of §5 | 2 |
| 19 ✓ | `M(G̃)`, `D`-deficiency, `k`-dof / minimal `k`-dof, rigid subgraphs, def=corank (JJ Thm 6.1 / Cor 6.2); Lem 3.1/3.3/3.4 | §2.5, §3 | 3 |
| 20 ✓ | Combinatorial induction: graph ops + forest surgery 4.1/4.2 + 4.3–4.8 + **Theorem 4.9** | §4 | 4 |
| 21a ✓ | **GC meet / projective-duality foundations** (the dual half of §2.1): `topEquiv`, `pairingDual`-iso, `complementIso`, `meet` — the substrate the panel layer + Lemma 5.4 + Phase 25 rest on | §2.1 (dual half) | 1 |
| 21 ✓ | Theorem 5.5 skeleton + base + **Case I** (6.2: 6.2/6.3/6.5) + **Case II** (6.3: 6.7/6.8), closing on the **genericity-free** content; **+ panel layer** (coplanar realizations). Genericity (Claim 6.4/6.9) enters as a cited black-box. | §5, §6.1–6.3 | 5 |
| 21b ✓ | **Genericity device** (Claim 6.4/6.9) + genericity-free accounting iffs + `V(G)`-relative count bridges. The realization *producers* re-scoped to 22–23 (math-first pass: the k=0 split is KT Case III, one row short via eq. 6.12; Case I splice is full-rank). | §6.1 (Claim 6.4), §6.3 (Claim 6.9) | 5 |
| 22a ✓ | **Case I realization** (§6.2 splice: full-rank, N4 contraction bridge + N6 composer). `lem:case-I-realization` green-modulo KT Claim 6.4 (`lem:claim-6-4`), via the **block-triangular reframe** (KT eq. 6.3 rank-addition over one common framework, routed through the device's independent-row count). | §6.2 | 5 |
| 22b ✓ | **KT Claim 6.4** (discharge the Case-I green-modulo obligation; closed 2026-06-05, `notes/Phase22b.md`). `lem:claim-6-4` (`case_I_realization`'s former `hclaim64`) is **fully discharged** (`\leanok`), so `lem:case-I-realization` is fully green. The reduction N-22b-1/2/3 cut Claim 6.4 to the single hypothesis `htransport`; the discharge then built the three composing bricks — **U3a** `hasGenericRealization_transport_relabel` (the contraction's generic IH transported to the relabel selector), **U3b** the genuine crux (the exterior-column projection loses zero rank on a rigid block, via `Z ⊔ range(extProj) = ⊤` whose one real-content input is the pin-count `finrank(pinnedMotionsOn t) = D(|Vᶜ|+1−|t|)`, plus the projected-subfamily extraction), **U2/U1** the collapse-relabel projected-row reproduction at KT eq. (6.7)'s degenerate placement — and the **route-(i)** motive strengthening (the link-recording conjunct discharging the U3a alignment + the `H`-leg `hswap`/`hne_ends`). The capstone **U4** producer `rigidContract_exterior_rank_transport_htransport` composes U3a ⊕ U3b ⊕ U2 to supply `htransport` from the contraction's generic IH, wired into `case_I_realization` (deleting its `hbundle`). All axiom-clean. The course-correction arc (the crux moved U2→U3, then U3a was found not a leaf; design doc §1.14–§1.24) is in `notes/Phase22b.md`. | §6.1 (Claim 6.4), §6.2, §5.1 | 5 |
| 22c ◷ | **Case III at `d=3`** (KT Lemma 6.10; in progress, opened 2026-06-05 design-pass-first, `notes/Phase22c.md`). The conjecture's crux: `theorem_55.hsplit` at `k=0`. The eq. (6.12) degenerate placement gives `+(D−1)`, one row short; the missing row comes from **Lemma 6.10**'s `D`-candidate-frameworks argument (3 candidates at `d=3`) — Claim 6.11 (combinatorial↔linear redundant-`(ab)i*`-row, off Lemma 4.3(ii) + IH) + Claim 6.12 (extensor-span genericity, bottoming on the green Phase-17 Lemma 2.1). Nodes `lem:case-II-realization` (KT's Case III), `lem:case-III`. Opened on a **layer-level design recon, not a build** (`DESIGN.md` *Scale-up: design the LAYER*). | §6.4.1 | 5 |
| 22d ◷ | **(deferred) `d=3` assembly** (the likely further cut, deferred until 22c's shape is clear): `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` `hub` brick (Track-independent, Phase-19-partition) + `thm:theorem-55` flip + wiring the fully-green `case_I_realization` into `theorem_55_generic`'s Case-I branch. | §5.1, §6.4.1 | 5 |
| 23 | **Case III, general `d`** (Lemma 6.13) → Thm 5.5 complete (incl. `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` + `hub`) → **Thm 5.6 → Conjecture 1.2** | §6.4.2, §5.2, §7 | 5 |
| 24 | 3-D generic bar-joint rigidity matroid (linear-matroid form; dim-3 specialization of Phase 4/8) | (J–J [13], Phase 4/8 reuse) | 6 |
| 25 | Crapo–Whiteley projective invariance + molecule ↔ hinge-concurrent body-hinge ↔ panel-hinge equivalence | §1.2 ([4,13,37]) | 7 |
| 26 | **Corollary 5.7**: `r(G²) = 3|V| − 6 − def(G̃)`; the protein-flexibility capstone | §5.2, §1.2 | 6+7 |

**This is a floor of 12 phases** (10 originally; +1 for the Phase-21a
meet foundations inserted by the 2026-06-03 panel re-scope, risk #7;
+1 for the Phase-21b genericity-device sub-phase scoped out of Phase 21
the same day, risk #4/#7). Phases 18, 21, and 22/23 each carry
enough that one or two may split once inside them (precedent: Phases
8–11 spawned perf/cleanup rounds and structural-edit sub-phases). The
program is the largest single undertaking in the project to date —
comparable in effort to Phases 1–16 combined. Sequence the cut-points
as living estimates; re-cut on contact.

### Per-phase detail

#### Phase 17 — Grassmann–Cayley extensor algebra (§2.1) — ✓ Complete

Done; full detail in `notes/Phase17.md`, dep-graph in
`molecular.tex` `sec:molecular`. Formalized the Grassmann–Cayley /
extensor layer in `Molecular/Extensor.lean`: homogeneous
coordinatization, the affine-independence ↔ top-extensor bridge, the
symbolic extensor/join on `ExteriorAlgebra ℝ (Fin (d+1) → ℝ)`, the
coordinatized Plücker bridge with KT's sign, the affine-subspace
extensor `C(·)`, and the hard core **Lemma 2.1**
(`omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent` — independence of the `D`
`(d−1)`-extensors of `d+1` affinely independent points), on which Case
III (Phases 22–23) bottoms out. Built the symbolic layer first with a
coordinatized bridge, per the user's full-GC choice.

#### Phase 18 — Panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` (§2.2–2.4) — ✓ Complete

Done; full detail in `notes/Phase18.md`, dep-graph in
`rigidity-matrix.tex` `sec:molecular-rigidity-matrix`. Built the genuine
panel-hinge rigidity
matrix `R(G,p)` in `Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean` (basis-free: hinge
constraint `S(u) − S(v) ∈ span C(p(e))` + dual-annihilator row block +
null space `Z(G,p) = infinitesimalMotions`), the trivial-motion layer
with the `D`-dimensional / `D·|V|` numeric counts (codimension form of
`rank R ≤ D(|V|−1)`), and the three rank lemmas — 5.1 pin-a-body
(`finrank_pinnedMotions_add_screwDim`), 5.3 parallel-hinges-full
(`eq_of_hingeConstraint_two_parallel`), 5.2 rotation semicontinuity
(`finrank_infinitesimalMotions_le_of_span_le`, the basis-free
span-refinement monotonicity form — see risk #3, resolved). KT Prop 1.1
(`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`, reconcile the rank form with Phase 16's
`thm:body-hinge-tay`) was originally deferred from Phase 18 to Phase 19;
at Phase-19 close it was **relocated forward to Phase 21+** — its
matroidal half (`def = corank M(G̃)`) landed green in Phase 19, but its
analytic half (`rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`) depends on the
generic-rank argument (Claim 6.4) and lands with the algebraic induction
(see the *Relocated forward* bullet under Phase 19 + the Phase 21 bullet).
The completed `rigidity-matrix.tex` carries no red node.

#### Phase 19 — `M(G̃)`, deficiency, `k`-dof graphs (§2.5, §3) — ✓ Complete

**Complete; see `notes/Phase19.md`.** Landed in `Molecular/Deficiency.lean`:
`M(G̃)` (boundary-regime `(D,D)` count matroid, clean — risk #2 resolved),
the `D`-deficiency `def(G̃) = maxₚ [D(|P|−1) − (D−1)d_G(P)]`, the
`k`-dof / `0`-dof / minimal-`k`-dof hierarchy, rigid + proper rigid
subgraphs, KT Lemmas 3.1/3.3/3.4 (matroidal-core forms), and the **full
def = corank bridge** `|B| + def(G̃) = D(|V|−1)` (JJ [15] Thm 6.1 / Cor 6.2,
proved in-repo axiom-free — risk #4 resolved, no axiom / no deferral).

- **Key reuse (as planned):** `M(G̃)` routed through the `D`-fold graphic
  union of Phase 13/14 (`unionPow_cycleMatroid` + `tutte_nash_williams`),
  **not** `CountMatroid.lean` (`ℓ<2k`). Confirmed clean by `matroidMG_indep_iff`.
- **Relocated forward at phase close (2026-06-02):**
  - **`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`** (KT Prop 1.1, the rank/reduction
    reconciliation) → **Phase 21+**. Its matroidal half (`def = corank M(G̃)`)
    is now green via `thm:def-eq-corank`, but its **analytic half** —
    `rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)` (JJ [15] Thm 6.1 geometric side, wiring
    the rigidity-matrix rank to the matroid corank) — is a separate object
    with no Lean yet, dependent on the generic-rank / genericity argument
    (Claim 6.4) deferred since Phase 15–16. The node was removed from the
    completed Phase-18 `rigidity-matrix.tex`; it gets (re)created in the
    algebraic-induction chapter when Phase 21 opens. Lands with Claim 6.4.
  - **Full KT 3.4** (`G[V(X)]` rigid — the tightness *equality*
    `|X−e| = D(|V(X)|−1)`, vs. the Phase-19 matroidal-core sparse/basis
    form) → **early Phase 20**. Now unblocked: the JJ09 reverse
    `le_rank_add_deficiency` supplies the lower bound `|X| > D(|V(X)|−1)`
    it waited on; still needs a vertex-induced-subgraph-from-edge-set
    construction (no existing `Graph α β` analogue).
  - **KT Lemma 3.5** (rigid-subgraph contraction preserves minimality —
    Case I engine) → **early Phase 20**.
- KT Lemmas 3.2 (not 3-edge-conn) and 3.6 (partition decomposition) remain
  off the Thm-4.9 critical path; 3.6 is needed only by Case 6.1, schedule
  with Phase 21.

#### Phase 20 — Combinatorial induction → Theorem 4.9 (§4)

Graph operations on `Graph α β`: splitting off `G_v^{ab}` at a degree-2
vertex, its inverse edge-splitting `H_{ab}^v`, removal `G_v`, rigid-
subgraph contraction `G/E'`. The forest-surgery core (Lemmas 4.1, 4.2)
+ the dof-tracking lemmas (4.3–4.8) + the three-case decomposition +
**Theorem 4.9** (every minimal body-hinge-rigid graph reduces to the
two-vertex double edge via splitting-off / rigid-contraction).

- **Hard core:** 4.1/4.2 (explicit forest surgery at a degree-2 vertex
  — no existing analogue, budget the most time); 4.6 (maximal-chain /
  degree-sequence counting guaranteeing the degree-2 vertex); 4.8 (the
  capstone, two circuit-swap arguments).
- **Inherited from Phase 19** (relocated at Phase-19 close): KT Lemma 3.5
  (rigid-subgraph contraction preserves minimality — Case I engine) and
  the full KT 3.4 (`G[V(X)]` rigid, the tightness *equality* + a
  vertex-induced-subgraph-from-edge-set construction; the lower bound it
  needs is now green via `le_rank_add_deficiency`). Schedule early.
- **Reuse:** matroid restriction/contraction + fundamental circuits
  (mathlib `Matroid.restrict`, `Matroid.fundCircuit`), the vendored
  union subsystem (`Matroid/Constructions/Union.lean`), `edgeMultiply`.
- **Route change (2026-06-02 — see `notes/Phase20.md` *Finding* +
  *Replan*).** Formalizing the forest surgery (4.1) surfaced that KT's
  Lemma 4.1 is over-quantified (false for `|I| < D`, formally disproved)
  and its proof of the base case glosses an unstated *balanced-packing*
  assumption (every forest in the `D`-forest partition meets `v`) — in
  both the 2011 (Lemma 4.1, p.660) and 2009 arXiv (Lemma 5.1, p.11)
  versions. The induction needs only `def(G̃ᵥᵃᵇ) ≤ def(G̃)` (KT 4.3),
  which is true and which we prove directly by a **deficiency-count
  partition comparison** through `def = corank` (Phase 19), bypassing the
  forest surgery. The surgery (and proving-or-refuting the balanced-packing
  lemma) is a non-blocking TODO; the hard core is now 4.6 / the capstone
  4.8, not 4.1/4.2.

#### Phase 21a — Grassmann–Cayley meet / projective-duality foundations

Inserted by the 2026-06-03 panel re-scope (risk #7). The dual sibling of
Phase 17: where Phase 17 built the *join*, 21a builds the *meet*
(regressive product) — the substrate on which the panel layer derives
coplanar hinges, Lemma 5.4 builds its cycle realization, and Phase 25
inherits the projective-duality dictionary. On `V = ℝ^(k+2)`, route (ii):
`topEquiv` (`⋀ᴺ V ≃ R`) → `pairingDual`-iso (`⋀ʲ(V*) ≃ (⋀ʲ V)*`, the
Phase-25 dictionary entry) → `complementIso` (`⋀ʲ V ≃ ⋀^(N−j) V`, via the
perfect wedge pairing) → `meet` + `meet_ne_zero_iff` (⟺ transversal).
Scope: regressive product only, no metric Hodge; projective *invariance*
→ Phase 25. Items `topEquiv` / `pairingDual`-iso / `complementIso` are
upstream-eligible (mirror directory). Full detail + checklist:
`notes/Phase21a.md`; decision: `DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge = hinge-coplanar
body-hinge*.

#### Phase 21 — Theorem 5.5 base + Cases I & II (§5, §6.1–6.3)

**Re-scoped 2026-06-03 (panel re-scope, risk #7; genericity scope-out,
risk #4/#7), resumed and building.** Two re-scopes landed this day:
(1) Theorem 5.5 and the realization-existence nodes are stated over
**panel** (hinge-coplanar) realizations, not free body-hinge ones — the
panel layer (`PanelHingeFramework` → `toBodyHinge` → `IsHingeCoplanar`),
gated on the Phase-21a meet, is now green; (2) the shared analytic crux
Claim 6.4/6.9 (the genericity device) is **scoped out into Phase 21b**,
so Phase 21 aims to **close on the genericity-free content** with the
device entering each remaining node as a **cited black-box**. See
`DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge = hinge-coplanar body-hinge* +
*Genericity device (Claim 6.4/6.9) is its own sub-phase (Phase 21b)*,
and `notes/Phase21.md` *Hand-off* for the node-by-node split.

The induction skeleton on `|V|` with hypothesis (6.1) and the
"nonparallel if simple" side condition. Base (`|V|=2`, via Lemma 5.3).
**Case I** (proper rigid subgraph): §6.2 Lemmas 6.2 (non-simple), 6.3
(simple, simple contraction; Claim 6.4 genericity → 21b), 6.5
(remaining; Claim 6.6). **Case II** (`k>0`, splitting): §6.3 Lemmas
6.7, 6.8 (Claim 6.9 → 21b) — the panel-hinge analogue of Whiteley's
bar-joint 1-extension. Cycle Lemma 5.4 ([4,34]) — its four Lean pieces
are green; the projective assembly is the 21b genericity device.

- **Genericity-free hard core (Phase 21):** the panel layer, the
  block-pin / `withGraph` / `withNormal` framework ops, the
  block-triangular rank *accounting* (reusing Phase 18 Lemma 5.1), the
  edge-substitution bridge, and the `hnew`/`hspan` reduction. The
  *analytic* hard core — Claim 6.4 / Lemma 6.3 genericity ("entries are
  polynomials in alg.-indep. panel coords ⇒ generic point attains max
  rank") and Lemma 6.8's generic 1-extension lift — is **Phase 21b**.
- **Inherited from Phase 19** (relocated at Phase-19 close, landed
  GREEN-modulo-21b in Phase 21): the analytic half of
  `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` (KT Prop 1.1) — `rank R(G,p) =
  D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)` (JJ [15] Thm 6.1 geometric side), wiring the
  rigidity-matrix rank `R(G,p)` (Phase 18) to the matroid corank
  (`def = corank M(G̃)`, Phase 19's `thm:def-eq-corank`).
  `rigidityMatrix_prop11` is the basis-free equality `dim Z = D + def`
  (= `RankHypothesis (deficiency n)`), pinned by the genericity-free
  upper bound (`hub`) + the 21b-cited generic-max-rank lower bound
  (`hgen`) as explicit hypotheses. Matroidal half already green; the
  generic-rank conclusion (`hgen`) is discharged in **Phase 21b**.
- Split realized: Phase 21 = genericity-free reductions; Phase 21b =
  the device. Case I vs Case II may still split within Phase 21.

#### Phase 21b — Genericity device (Claim 6.4/6.9) (§6.1, §6.3)

Scoped out of Phase 21 on 2026-06-03 (risk #4/#7), the analytic sibling
of the Phase-21a meet sub-phase. The one genuinely new analytic crux of
KT's algebraic induction: the entries of the panel-hinge rigidity matrix
`R(G,p)` are polynomials in the algebraically independent panel
coordinates (the per-vertex normals), so the rank is lower
semicontinuous and attains its maximum on a Zariski-open (generic) set —
a single good realization at the target rank lifts to a generic one
(Claim 6.4, and its Case-II twin Claim 6.9). This is the shared
black-box that Phase 21 leaves cited in `lem:case-I`, `lem:case-II`,
`thm:theorem-55`, `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`, and the projective
assembly of `lem:cycle-realization`; Phase 21b discharges it once and
the consumers `\uses` it.

- **Scope (at open):** the panel-coordinate parametrization of `R(G,p)`
  (entries as polynomials in the normals), the generic-max-rank lemma
  over that family, and the discharge of each consumer's cited
  hypothesis — `hspan` for Case II (every base-pinned motion lands in
  the two new spans, via the rank count), the block-triangular generic
  gluing for Case I, the cycle projective assembly, and the generic-rank
  reconciliation for Prop 1.1.
- **Reuse-to-assess: RESOLVED → route (a), multivariate.** The Phase-6/8
  Gram-det machinery (`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean`) is the
  right base, but lifted two ways: to *rank* form (`finrank ≥ r`, not just
  full-rank) and — the key finding (2026-06-04) — to *multivariate*
  Zariski-open non-vanishing. The panel-matrix entries are degree-2
  (bilinear in the per-vertex normals), so the consumers' realizations are
  **not** reached along any affine line; a single-scalar/affine engine is
  only a special case and does not prove Claim 6.4. The genuine engine is
  "a nonzero multivariate minor polynomial has a non-root" via
  `MvPolynomial.funext`. Landed as four mirror bricks (the
  `exists_…_polynomial` family); the device statement is rebuilt on them.
  Bottoms (for Case III's share) on Lemma 2.1 (Phase 17).
- **Phase 21b COMPLETE (closed 2026-06-04).** `lem:genericity-device`
  (multivariate Claim 6.4) + the genericity-free accounting iffs + the
  `V(G)`-relative count bridges (N1–N3) + the reusable row/glue infra
  (N7b-0/1/2/3, the device-closure glue) are green and axiom-clean. The
  motive is `V(G)`-relative (`rank R = D(|V(G)|−1)`); the absolute
  null-space form was unsatisfiable for non-spanning inductive subgraphs
  (`DESIGN.md` *Realization motive must be V(G)-relative*).
- **Realization producers re-scoped to Phases 22–23** (math-first pass vs.
  KT §6.2–6.3; `notes/Phase21b.md` *Finding A/B*). The `theorem_55.hsplit`
  branch (k=0 reducible-vertex split) is KT **Case III**, not Case II: KT's
  eq. (6.12) degenerate placement is one row short of full rank for k=0 and
  needs the Lemma 6.10/6.13 redundant-edge row. Only Case I (proper rigid
  subgraph, §6.2 splice) reaches full rank. So both producers
  (`lem:case-I-realization`, `lem:case-II-realization`) live with the
  realization layer in 22–23; `thm:theorem-55` and
  `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` stay green-modulo-22–23 (awaiting the
  producers + the genericity-free `hub` partition brick). Lessons:
  `DESIGN.md` *Constructibility recon before scheduling a producer build*
  + *Phase Case-naming must match KT's k-bookkeeping*.
- **Also consumed by Phases 22–23** (Case III's candidate-framework
  genericity, Claims 6.11/6.12) — building it as its own sub-phase paid
  off there too.
- Final state + the KT math for both producers (Finding A/B) + the 22–23
  hand-off live in `notes/Phase21b.md`.

#### Phase 22 — Realization layer (sub-lettered: 22a + 22b + 22c + 22d) (§6.2, §6.4.1)

Opened as a single Phase 22 on 2026-06-04, then **split into sub-phases the same
day** because it over-broadly bundled three independent bodies of work — Track A
(Case I, ~90% green), Track B (Case III at `d=3`, the crux, entirely red), and the
`d=3` assembly. Sub-lettering (22a, 22b, …) keeps the integer phase numbers 23–26
stable. **22a** = Case I realization (`notes/Phase22a.md`, ✓ complete); **22b** =
KT Claim 6.4 (the discharge of 22a's green-modulo obligation, `notes/Phase22b.md`,
✓ complete 2026-06-05 — `lem:claim-6-4` fully discharged, so `lem:case-I-realization`
is fully green; the reduction N-22b-1/2/3 cut Claim 6.4 to `htransport`, then the
U1→U4 + route-(i) sequence built the three composing bricks — U3a relabel-leg
transport, **U3b** the genuine crux (exterior projection loses zero rank on a rigid
block), U2/U1 collapse-relabel row reproduction — and the U4 producer composing them);
**22c** = Case III at `d=3` (KT §6.4.1, Lemma 6.10, `notes/Phase22c.md`, ◷ in
progress, opened 2026-06-05 **design-pass-first** — the conjecture's crux, opened on
a layer-level design recon, not a build); **22d** = the `d=3` assembly
(`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` `hub` + `thm:theorem-55` flip + the Case-I wiring),
the **likely further cut, deferred** until 22c's shape is clear (the parked "22c+"
placeholder split into 22c + 22d at 22c open, exactly as 22a→22b+, 22b→22c+).
Math for all worked out in `notes/Phase21b.md`
*Finding A/B*; the green Phase-21b infra — device, count bridge, N7b row sub-nodes,
splice/union glue — feeds them.

**Phase 22a — Case I realization (§6.2) — ✓ Complete.** Track A:
the tractable entry point, full-rank, independent of Case III. The composer
`PanelHingeFramework.case_I_realization` (`lem:case-I-realization`) discharges
`theorem_55`'s Case-I branch **green-modulo a single dischargeable hypothesis = KT
Claim 6.4** (the new red node `lem:claim-6-4`, deferred to Phase 22b — the same
green-modulo pattern as Phase 21 → 21b). **Delivered via the block-triangular
reframe.** A coordinator verification pass found the first composer attempt blocked
on a **structural divergence from KT**: it translated KT eq. (6.3)'s
**block-triangular rank-addition** (leg-wise placements, ranks add) into the
project's motion-space **common-seed splice glue** (one placement rigid on both
legs), and three successive bridge hypotheses (`hcrig` → false `hpinc` → too-strong
`htransportGP`) each type-checked but were undischargeable. The fix reproduces KT's
block-triangular structure directly: exhibit `D(|V(G)|−1)` independent rigidity rows
of the *single* common framework `ofNormals G ends q₀`, split block-wise via the
exterior-column projection (the H-block edges ⊔ the surviving edges made independent
by that projection), and read rigidity off the device's independent-row count — no
common placement rigid on both legs. The one deferred obligation is Claim 6.4 itself
(the surviving block's exterior-projected rank at the generic placement, KT
eqs. (6.5)/(6.9)). **Standing lesson:** `DESIGN.md` *Match the source's argument
structure, not just its conclusion* (the common-seed glue type-checked but kept
needing fresh bridge hypotheses to span a gap KT's structure does not have). Full
detail + the hpinc→asymmetric→block-triangular→Qc-non-root design arc:
`notes/Phase22a.md` + `notes/Phase22-realization-design.md` §1.12–§1.16.

**Track A — Case I producer (full-rank, KT §6.2). [22a scope]** Independent of Case III;
reaches full `D(|V|−1)` with no shortfall (the contracted vertex's two
boundary hinges give `+D` via Lemma 5.3 / the splice). Nodes:
- **N4 `lem:rigidContract-isMinimalKDof`** — graph↔matroid contraction-
  minimality bridge. **GREEN** (`rigidContract_isMinimalKDof`, axiom-clean).
  Landed as the Whitney-style sub-build the recon predicted: N4a (0-dof ⟹
  preconnected) → N4b (cycleMatroid under collapse) → N4c (union↔contraction
  bridge `matroidMG_rigidContract_eq_contract`, via rank-saturation + the count
  route) → N4 reconciliation (assemble the green `contraction_isMinimalKDof`
  through N4c + exact collapse vertex-count + def=corank).
- **N5 `lem:case-I-splice-placement`** — splice the inductive legs `(H,p₁)`,
  `(G/E',p₂)` along boundary hinges at panel intersections (eq. 6.6); needs a
  *panel-transversality* lemma (two generic `(d−1)`-panels meet in a
  `(d−2)`-flat) + block-triangular independence (Lemma 5.1). Three KT
  sub-cases (6.2/6.3/6.5). Research-shaped — **decompose math-first** (run the
  constructibility recon).
- **N6 `lem:case-I-realization`** — compose N4 + N5 + the green glue
  (`isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_union_of_inter`) + device ⇒ discharges
  `theorem_55.hcontract`.

**Track B — Case II/III producer at `d=3` (the crux, KT §6.3 + §6.4.1). [22c+ scope]**
This is `theorem_55.hsplit` (k=0 split). The eq. (6.12) degenerate placement
(`p1(vb)=q(ab)` reproduces the `e₀` row; the green N7b-0/1/2/3 + glue feed it)
gives `+(D−1)` — one short — and the missing row is **Lemma 6.10** (`d=3`,
3 candidates `(G,p₁),(G,p₂),(G,p₃)`):
- **Claim 6.11** (combinatorial↔linear): `R(G_v^{ab},q)` has a redundant
  `ab`-row, via Lemma 4.3(ii) + the IH. The hardest non-linear-algebra step —
  wires `M(G̃_v^{ab})` to the row matroid of `R`.
- **Claim 6.12** (extensor-span genericity): if all candidates fail, a nonzero
  `r ∈ ℝᴰ` is ⟂ all extensors on `d+1` generic panels, which by **Lemma 2.1**
  (Phase 17) span `ℝᴰ` — contradiction. The degree-2 condition forces all
  candidates to test the same `r` (eq. 6.44).
- ~12 pages, the single largest proof in the paper; consider an abstracted
  "candidate normal form" lemma to avoid repeating the row-ops three times.

**Process — design-pass-first for Case III (Phase-22 meta-lesson, 2026-06-04).**
Track B / Case III is research-shaped and *interlocking* (Claims 6.11/6.12 + the
candidate framework + the row matroid wired to `M(G̃_v^{ab})`). Per `DESIGN.md`
*Constructibility recon … → Scale-up: design the LAYER, not just the node*: run a
**layer-level design pass up front** (read the whole Case-III argument against KT
§6.4 + the green Lemma 2.1, decide what each piece needs from the shared motive /
candidate structure) **before** grinding it node-by-node. Case I cost ~10
incremental commits before a one-commit design pass surfaced the binding gap (the
too-weak motive); don't repeat that — for Case III, design first.

**Build summary (2026-06-04/05; full detail + decision history in
`notes/Phase22a.md`).** The Case-I producer landed as a chain of green bricks
bounded on the Phase-21b infra: N4 (the Whitney-style contraction-minimality
sub-build N4a→N4b→N4c, green), N6a (non-simple Case I), the **two-motive split**
(a general-position motive `HasGenericFullRankRealization` + forgetful map; bare
`theorem_55` untouched), the (G2) general-position `MvPolynomial` factor, the
N6b/N6c simple Case-I coupling, and the N6 leg-transport `ends`-swap brick. The
composer's IH-shape gap (the IH supplies the *bare* `HasFullRankRealization`, the
coupling needs `HasGenericFullRankRealization`) was closed by the **generic-motive
induction** G2a–c: `theorem_55_generic` re-runs `minimal_kdof_reduction` at the
*conditioned* motive `(G.Simple → GP) ∧ bare`, with only the Lemma-6.3 Case-I legs
needing the generic IH (hard kernel: `G/E(H)` simplicity, `map_simple`,
KT 6.3-vs-6.5). The composer assembly G3a–c then surfaced the structural divergence
(above): the body-set splice's common-seed glue forced undischargeable bridge
hypotheses, fixed by the **block-triangular reframe**, leaving KT Claim 6.4
(`lem:claim-6-4`) as the one green-modulo obligation. **22b** (✓ complete 2026-06-05,
`notes/Phase22b.md`): KT Claim 6.4 fully discharged — the reduction N-22b-2 → N-22b-1
→ N-22b-3 cut it to `htransport`, then the U1→U4 + route-(i) sequence built the three
composing bricks (U3a relabel-leg transport, **U3b** the genuine crux = the
exterior-column projection loses zero rank on a rigid block, U2/U1 collapse-relabel row
reproduction) and the U4 producer composing them into `htransport`; `lem:case-I-realization`
is now fully green.

**Phase 22c — Case III at `d=3` (KT §6.4.1, Lemma 6.10) — ◷ In progress
(opened 2026-06-05, design-pass-first; `notes/Phase22c.md`).** Track B at `d=3`,
the conjecture's crux: the `theorem_55.hsplit` producer at `k=0`, the single
largest proof in KT (~12 pages, `D = 6`). The eq. (6.12) degenerate placement
(`p₁(vb)=q(ab)`, the `vb`-row reproducing the `e₀=ab` row → block-triangular with
`R(G_v^{ab},q)`) gives `+(D−1)`, one row short; the missing row comes from
**Lemma 6.10**'s `D`-candidate-frameworks argument (three candidates
`(G,p₁),(G,p₂),(G,p₃)` at `d=3`) — **Claim 6.11** (the redundant `(ab)i*`-row, off
KT Lemma 4.3(ii) + the IH, the combinatorial↔linear bridge to `M(G̃_v^{ab})`) and
**Claim 6.12** (extensor-span genericity: if all candidates fail, a nonzero
`r ∈ ℝ⁶ ⟂` all extensors on `d+1` generic panels, which by the green Phase-17
Lemma 2.1 span `ℝ⁶` — contradiction; the degree-2 condition forces all to test the
same `r`, eq. 6.44). Nodes `lem:case-II-realization` (KT's Case III), `lem:case-III`.
**Opened on a layer-level design recon, not a build** (the design-pass-first
process below): Case I burned ~10 node-by-node commits before a layer pass surfaced
the binding gap, so for Case III the layer recon runs first. The `d=3` assembly is
the deferred **Phase 22d** (below). KT math: `notes/Phase21b.md` *Finding A/B*,
`notes/Phase22-realization-design.md` §1.25.

**Phase 22d — `d=3` assembly — ◷ Planning (deferred until 22c's shape is clear).**
The genericity-free `hub` partition brick of `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` (a
Phase-19-partition obligation, **Track-independent**, itself multi-commit —
decompose math-first before scheduling), the `thm:theorem-55` flip (one-line once
the three case producers land), and wiring the fully-green `case_I_realization`
into `theorem_55_generic`'s Case-I branch. Cut deferred exactly as 22a→22b+ and
22b→22c+: name the next distinct sub-phase, do not pre-commit its node list before
its shape is clear.

#### Phase 23 — Case III general `d` + assembly (§6.4.2, §5.2, §7)

**Lemma 6.13**: generalize the `d=3` argument to a length-`d` chain
`v₀…v_d` with `d` candidates and isomorphisms `ρᵢ`; reuse Claim 6.11
and Lemma 2.1 verbatim, generalize the matrix bookkeeping (index-heavy).
Then complete **Theorem 5.5**, derive **Theorem 5.6** (edge-strip to a
minimal `k`-dof subgraph; re-add edges only grows rank; projective
invariance to arrange panels), and state **Conjecture 1.2** as a
theorem.

- **Hard core:** the `d`-fold chain bookkeeping (eqs. 6.59–6.64); the
  genericity/Lemma-2.1 step generalizes cleanly.

#### Phase 24 — 3-D generic bar-joint rigidity matroid

Specialize the dimension-general `Framework V d` (Phase 4) to `d=3`
generic bar-joint frameworks; package the generic rigidity matroid via
`Matroid.ofFun` (Phase 8's linear-matroid framing, now in `d=3`);
define `r(·)` = its rank. **Scope guard:** this is the *linear* matroid
only — no combinatorial/Laman-3D characterization (open per KT §7).

- Mostly reuse; the dim-3 specialization + generic-placement existence
  (à la Phase 8's `exists_uniform_rowIndependent_placement`) is the work.

#### Phase 25 — Projective duality + molecule modelling equivalence

Crapo–Whiteley [4] projective invariance of infinitesimal rigidity in
`ℝ³`; the chain bar-joint of `G²` ↔ hinge-concurrent body-hinge of `G`
↔ panel-hinge of `G` (Whiteley/Jackson–Jordán [13,37]). The geometric
heart of the molecule connection. Likely the hardest of 24–26 (genuine
projective-geometry + the square-graph modelling argument).

#### Phase 26 — Corollary 5.7 (molecule application capstone)

Assemble `r(G²) = 3|V| − 6 − def(G̃)` from Thm 5.6 (Phase 23),
projective duality + molecule equivalence (Phase 25), and the dim-3
rigidity matroid (Phase 24). The protein-flexibility statement /
pebble-game-validity payoff (§1.2). Attribute the rank formula to
Jackson–Jordán [13], conjecture-resolution to KT.

## Reuse map (existing machinery each phase leans on)

- **Phase 4 `Framework.lean`** (dimension-general frameworks, rigidity
  map, infinitesimal rigidity) → Phases 18, 24.
- **Phase 6–8 rigidity matroid / `Matroid.ofFun` linear framing,
  `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean` Gram-det LI mirrors** →
  Phases 18, 21, 24 (genericity / rank arguments).
- **Phase 12 vendored matroid union/submodular
  (`Matroid/Constructions/{Submodular,Union}.lean`)** → Phases 19, 20,
  22 (restriction, contraction, fundamental circuits, union rank).
- **Phase 13 Tutte–Nash-Williams (`BodyBar/TreePacking.lean`)** →
  Phase 19 (`def=0` ⇔ packing; def=corank bridge).
- **Phase 14–16 `BodyBar/{KFrame,Framework,TayTheorem,BodyHinge}.lean`,
  `edgeMultiply`, `bodyBarDim`/`bodyHingeMult`** → Phases 18 (Prop 1.1
  reconciliation), 19 (`G̃`, fibers `ẽ`).
- **Mirror directory `CombinatorialRigidity/Mathlib/`** → Phase 17
  (exterior-algebra / Plücker mirror lemmas are upstream-eligible).

## Risk register / open questions

1. **Grassmann–Cayley depth.** User chose the full symbolic GC algebra.
   Risk: building more abstract machinery than the coordinatized proofs
   need. Mitigation: Phase 17 builds the symbolic layer but lands a
   coordinatized bridge early so downstream phases can stay concrete.
2. **`ℓ = 2k = D` boundary regime** (Phase 19). *Resolved:*
   `matroidMG_indep_iff` confirmed the `D`-fold union + Tutte–Nash-Williams
   covers the boundary regime cleanly; no `CountMatroid.lean` (`ℓ<2k`).
3. **Lemma 5.2 perturbation** (Phase 18). *Resolved:* Phase 18 chose
   the basis-free span-refinement monotonicity form
   (`finrank_infinitesimalMotions_le_of_span_le`) and sidestepped
   analytic rank-semicontinuity entirely — no perturbation argument.
4. **Externals to axiomatize vs prove.** Lemma 5.4 (cycles, [4,34]),
   the [29] pin-a-body fact (Lemma 5.1, *proved* in Phase 18). The [15]
   generic-rank bridge (JJ Thm 6.1 / Cor 6.2) splits: its **matroidal
   half** `def(G̃) = corank M(G̃)` was *proved in-repo axiom-free* in
   Phase 19 (`thm:def-eq-corank`, no deferral); its **analytic half**
   `rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)` lands with Claim 6.4 in Phase 21b.
   User scope is "fully formalize". **Lemma 5.4 decision (2026-06-03):
   formalize, not cite** — as genuine *panel* content (the cycle's
   panel realization with independent hinge extensors = the
   Crapo–Whiteley projective fact), its own sub-phase. Supersedes the
   per-phase cite option for 5.4. See risk #7 + `DESIGN.md`
   *Panel-hinge = hinge-coplanar body-hinge*.
   **Genericity-device decision (2026-06-03):** the shared analytic
   crux Claim 6.4/6.9 (rank/dimension count: matrix entries polynomial
   in alg.-indep. panel coords ⇒ generic max rank) is **scoped out of
   Phase 21 into its own focused sub-phase, Phase 21b** (the analytic
   sibling of 21a). Phase 21 closes on the genericity-free content,
   entering the device as a cited black-box in `lem:case-I`,
   `lem:case-II`, `thm:theorem-55`, `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`, and
   the projective assembly of `lem:cycle-realization`. See `DESIGN.md`
   *Genericity device (Claim 6.4/6.9) is its own sub-phase (Phase 21b)*
   + the Phase 21b detail below.
5. **Molecule equivalence primary source** (Phase 25). Whiteley [35] is
   an unpublished preprint; anchor on Jackson–Jordán [13] (Combinatorica
   2008) for the citable result.
6. **General 3-D rigidity is open** (KT §7). The molecule app does NOT
   require it; Phase 24's scope guard must hold or the program balloons.
7. **Panel = hinge-coplanar body-hinge not modeled** (found 2026-06-03,
   mid-Phase-21; **the central modeling correction of the program**).
   KT's panel-hinge framework is a body-hinge framework that is
   *hinge-coplanar* — all hinges at each vertex share a hyperplane
   (KT p.647) — and the conjecture's content is that this constraint
   does not drop rigidity. Phase 18's `BodyHingeFramework` carries the
   *free* (body-hinge) `p` only, so the algebraic-induction statements
   as first drafted (`thm:theorem-55`, the realization-existence nodes)
   prove the **body-hinge** rank theorem — by Prop 1.1 essentially the
   Tay–Whiteley + Phase-19 `def=corank` result already in hand — not the
   conjecture. *Mitigation:* add a **panel layer** — per-vertex
   hyperplanes with hinges derived as intersections (auto-coplanar,
   reuses all rank infra verbatim); state Thm 5.5/5.6 + Cases I–III over
   it. Re-scopes Phases 21–23. Full decision + the (A) predicate vs (B)
   panel-data analysis: `DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge = hinge-coplanar
   body-hinge*. **Resolved:** the panel layer landed (Phase 21 + the
   Phase-21a meet substrate); Phases 21/21a/21b are complete.

## Opening the next phase

Phases 17–22b + 21a are complete; **Phase 22 (the realization layer) is
sub-lettered** — opened as a single Phase 22 on 2026-06-04, then split the same day
into **22a** (Case I realization, ✓ complete; work log `notes/Phase22a.md`), **22b**
(KT Claim 6.4, ✓ complete 2026-06-05; work log `notes/Phase22b.md`), **22c** (Case III
at `d=3`, ◷ in progress, opened 2026-06-05; work log `notes/Phase22c.md`), and **22d**
(the deferred `d=3` assembly, ◷ planning — the parked "22c+" placeholder split into
22c + 22d at 22c open). Sub-lettering keeps the integer phase numbers 23–26 stable.

**Current sub-phase: 22c — Case III at `d=3` (KT §6.4.1, Lemma 6.10), the
conjecture's crux.** This is `theorem_55.hsplit` at `k=0`: the eq. (6.12) degenerate
placement gives `+(D−1)`, one row short, and the missing row comes from Lemma 6.10's
`D`-candidate-frameworks argument (Claim 6.11 combinatorial↔linear + Claim 6.12
extensor-span genericity via the green Phase-17 Lemma 2.1); nodes
`lem:case-II-realization`, `lem:case-III`. **Opened design-pass-first** (`DESIGN.md`
*Scale-up: design the LAYER, not just the node*): the opening commit is docs-only
(scope cut + the layer-recon plan + a first recon pass); **the next concrete commit
continues the layer design recon — still docs-only — settling the candidate
structure and the four open recon questions (candidate normal form vs. three inlined
copies; `d=3`-first; Claim 6.11's row-matroid bridge; Claim 6.12's "same `r`"
packaging), BEFORE cutting any Lean node.** The green infra it builds on: the Case-I
composer `case_I_realization` (now fully green, ready to wire into
`theorem_55_generic`'s Case-I branch), the Phase-21b device + count bridge + N7b row
sub-nodes + splice/union glue, the Phase-22b Claim-6.4 bricks, and — load-bearing —
Phase-17 Lemma 2.1. KT math: `notes/Phase21b.md` *Finding A/B* +
`notes/Phase22-realization-design.md` §1.25 — 22c formalizes it, it does not
re-derive it.

**Deferred sub-phase: 22d — the `d=3` assembly** (`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`
`hub` brick, Track-independent, + the `thm:theorem-55` flip + the Case-I wiring);
the likely further cut, deferred until 22c's shape is clear.
