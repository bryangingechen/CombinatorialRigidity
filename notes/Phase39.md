# Phase 39 — PENCIL: the hinge-pencil molecular conjecture (work log)

**Status:** in progress (opened 2026-07-23, recon-first).

## Current state

The opening recon ran 2026-07-23 (full record + grounding:
`notes/Phase39-design.md`). Verdicts: **R1** — statement pinned
(containment model + per-body homogeneous concurrency point;
typechecked candidate shapes in the design doc), stratum satisfiable,
projectively self-dual on-stratum modulo one new transport lemma.
**R2** — no refutation: exact-rational rank experiments attain the
full target on every graph tested (incl. four deg-3 bodies at the
tight minimal-0-dof count and five deg-4 bodies); negative data is
confined to the deep all-coplanar locus of *sparse* graphs. **R3** —
KT's route does **not** survive verbatim: Lemma 6.2 / Case II survive,
but the outer Theorem-5.6 strip-extend layer, the Case-I connecting
glue, and Claim 6.12's span (6 → 5, a quantified 1-dim shortfall) all
consume freedom the pencil pin removes — three open cores, so the
phase is **not** the queued "warmup". Next concrete step: **user
adjudication** — proceed with the design doc's W0–W5 decomposition
(W0 is compiler-ready), or close the phase with the recon as its
deliverable (statement pinned, conjecture numerically supported,
route obstruction mapped, conjecture left open).

## The question

KT's theorem (formalized: `molecular_conjecture`, Phases 17–26; the
multigraph/coplanar-model strengthening, Phase 35) says the generic
body-hinge rank in `ℝ³` is already achieved on the *panel* stratum —
each body's hinges coplanar — and, by projective duality (Phase 25),
on the *molecular* stratum — each body's hinges concurrent. PENCIL
asks about the **intersection stratum**: each body's hinges both
concurrent *and* coplanar, i.e. a **pencil** of lines through a point
in a plane. Does a pencil realization generic in that stratum still
achieve the generic body-hinge rank (Tay's tree-packing count;
`5G` ⊇ 6 edge-disjoint spanning trees at `d = 3` via KT Cor. 5.7)?

In the `G²` molecular reading (Phase 25/26 modelling), the hinges at
the body of atom `v` are the bond lines through `p(v)` — concurrency
is automatic — so the pencil condition says **`v`'s bond-star is
coplanar** (its neighbors lie in a plane through `p(v)`). Chemically:
sp²/planar-bonded atoms. So PENCIL reads: *does the molecular count
stay valid for molecules with planar-bonded atoms?* The condition
only bites at bodies of degree ≥ 3 (two coplanar lines are
automatically projectively concurrent).

Trivial direction: pencil ⇒ panel per body, so pencil rank ≤ generic
(KT). The content is the lower bound. The all-bodies statement is the
strongest form: any mixed version (pencil on a subset of bodies,
generic elsewhere) follows by rank lower-semicontinuity, since the
all-pencil stratum sits inside every mixed stratum.

The queue entry hoped for a warmup (no new carrier material); the
opening recon **refuted the warmup premise** — the carrier material is
indeed all in-tree, but three KT proof steps consume panel-only
freedom the pencil pin removes (see *Opening recon verdicts*). As of
2026-07-23 no literature result on this stratum was found (searched;
Jordán 2016 and the KT paper are silent) — **this is new mathematics**.

## Opening recon verdicts (R1–R3, landed 2026-07-23)

Full record, grounding, and the W0–W5 decomposition:
**`notes/Phase39-design.md`**. One-line verdicts:

- **R1** — panel-side statement pinned in the Phase-35 containment
  model + per-body homogeneous concurrency point (`ExtensorThroughPoint`
  dual of `ExtensorInPanel`; typechecked shapes in the design doc);
  satisfiable for every graph; self-dual on-stratum via the landed
  `screwComplementIso` modulo one new transport lemma. Surprise: for
  dense graphs (K4, K3,3, theta(2,2,2)) the stratum *collapses* to the
  all-coplanar locus.
- **R2** — conjecture survives all exact-rational rank tests
  (pencil-generic = full target rank everywhere tested, incl. the
  collapsed dense strata); the deep all-coplanar locus is deficient
  exactly when `2|E| < 3|V| − 3` (deficit = the spline count) — the
  queued "all-coplanar is rank-deficient" claim is a *bar-joint-side*
  fact, false for body-hinge on dense graphs.
- **R3** — KT Lemma 6.2 / Case II survive with pinned choices; the
  outer Thm-5.6 strip-extend, the Case-I glue (Claim 6.4), and Case
  III's Claim 6.12 span (6 → 5, exactly 1-dim short when both chain
  ends have deg ≥ 3) break — three open cores.

## Blockers / open questions

- **User adjudication of the phase's continuation** (proceed on the
  design doc's W0–W5 vs close with the recon as deliverable). Nothing
  else blocks; prerequisites are all in-tree (Phases 17–26, 35).

## Hand-off / next phase

**Next concrete step: user adjudication** (see *Blockers*). If the
phase proceeds: the next dispatch is **W0** of
`notes/Phase39-design.md` — land `ExtensorThroughPoint` +
`HasPencilPanelRealization` (spike-pinned signatures) + the
`screwComplementIso` predicate-transport lemma, and open the blueprint
chapter on those nodes. If it closes: a phase-close commit recording
the recon verdict as the deliverable (statement pinned, conjecture
open, route obstruction mapped) per `PHASE-BOUNDARIES.md`.

## Adjacent directions (orientation only, not this phase)

ORIGAMI (`notes/Origami.md`, next queued) is the bar-joint-side
analog; the wider unqueued survey — incl. IDENT-PANEL, the nearest
neighbor — is `notes/IdeaBacklog.md`.

## Decisions made during this phase

- **Opening recon landed** (2026-07-23): R1–R3 verdicts as above;
  canonical record `notes/Phase39-design.md`. Method: KT primary
  source (page pointers re-verified), landed definition bodies, a
  typechecked `lake env lean` statement spike (scratch, not
  committed), exact-rational rank experiments (configurations +
  results tabulated in the design doc).
- **Negative-data correction** (2026-07-23, recon): the queued
  "all-atoms-coplanar is rank-deficient" is a bar-joint/`G²` fact
  (via the general-position-gated dictionary); in the body-hinge
  model the coplanar locus attains full target rank whenever
  `2|E| ≥ 3|V| − 3` (numerics), and is deficient by exactly the
  spline count otherwise. PENCIL carries no `G²` corollary without
  new dictionary work at degenerate placements.
- **Recon-first; no pinned statement at open** (2026-07-23, per the
  queue entry + `notes/Pencil.md`): R1's statement/satisfiability
  questions are genuinely open, so the open commit pins no Lean
  signature and no blueprint node.
- **Blueprint chapter deferred to the R1 verdict** (2026-07-23):
  `notes/Pencil.md` planned the forward-mode chapter opening with the
  phase, but with R1 unsettled a chapter-open red node risks the
  known plausible-"corrected"-statement failure mode (dispatch-log
  2026-07-11); the Phase-32/34/35 precedent — chapter opens on the
  recon verdicts — applies instead. Re-flagged here rather than
  silently dropped.
- **Higher-`d` flag discharged** (2026-07-23, recon): the stratum is
  self-dual and the chain analysis carries over at every `d` (only
  chain *ends* get pinned); nothing about `d > 3` looks easier — see
  `notes/Phase39-design.md` *Higher-`d` note*. The between-strata
  hierarchy stays in `notes/IdeaBacklog.md` Tier A.
