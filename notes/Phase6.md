# Phase 6 — Laman's theorem, (⇒) direction (work log)

**Status:** in progress.

This file is the per-phase work record. See `../ROADMAP.md` §6 for the
high-level plan and `../DESIGN.md` for cross-cutting design choices.

**Workflow:** Phase 6 runs in **forward blueprint mode** (Option C,
hybrid skeleton) per `../blueprint/DESIGN.md`. The blueprint chapter
`chapter/laman-theorem.tex` (its $\Rightarrow$-direction subsection)
is the authoritative dep-graph and lemma index; this file does **not**
duplicate it. Each Lean session picks a leaf-most red node from the
dep-graph, formalizes it, and adds `\lean{...}` + `\leanok` to its
blueprint entry. Phase-end pass: write 1–3-sentence prose proofs per
entry against the now-stable Lean.

## Current state

Phase 5 closed with the iff statement
`isGenericallyRigid_two_iff_exists_isLaman_le` composed but
`sorry`-blocked on `IsGenericallyRigid.exists_isLaman_le`
(`LamanTheorem.lean:122`). That one `sorry` is the entire Phase 6
target — the project has no other unproved declarations.

**Forward-mode skeleton landed** (commit `39b2152`): the
$\Rightarrow$ subsection of `chapter/laman-theorem.tex` now carries
six new red nodes laying out the intended proof — `def:edgeSet-rowIndependent`,
`lem:rigidityMap-finrank-range-ge-of-isGenericallyRigid-two`,
`lem:exists-rowIndependent-edge-basis`,
`lem:trivialMotions-three-le-ker-of-affinelySpanning-two`,
`lem:rigidityMap-finrank-range-le-of-affinelySpanning-two`,
`lem:exists-affinelySpanning-rigid-placement-two`,
`lem:isSparse-of-rowIndependent-two` — plus the rewritten proof
sketch of the target theorem referencing them. The dep-graph at
`blueprint/web/dep_graph_document.html` is the authoritative view.

**Attribution research and prose refinement landed.** Jordán 2016
§1.3.1 + §2.2 cross-checked the citation chain (local PDF, see
`../CLAUDE.md` *Reading PDFs in `.refs/`*):
- **Asimow–Roth 1978** (Trans. AMS **245**, 279–289) added to
  `bibliography.bib`; cited at the `frameworks.tex` section preamble
  (covers `def:rigidityMap`, `def:isInfinitesimallyRigid`, and the
  trivial-motions identification all at once) and again in the
  trivial-motions lemma preamble.
- The $\Rightarrow$ section preamble of `chapter/laman-theorem.tex`
  now attributes the necessary direction to Laman 1970 in its
  Asimow–Roth 1978 linear-algebraic formulation; Lov\'asz--Yemini
  1982 is acknowledged as the matroid framing (the easy direction
  of their identity is what facts (a) and (b) together prove).
  Jord\'an 2016 Lemma 1.3.1 is cited as the modern presentation we
  follow for the sparsity-from-row-independence step.
- Maxwell 1864 is the historical primary for the counting argument;
  Jord\'an treats it as classical without citing it. We follow
  Jord\'an and skip Maxwell unless the user wants historical depth.

## Architectural choices made up front

These extend `../DESIGN.md` *Choices to revisit*; if any turns out
wrong, revisit there.

- **Forward-mode blueprint authoring** (Option C). The blueprint
  chapter's $\Rightarrow$-direction subsection becomes the
  authoritative dep-graph from Phase 6 commit 1; `\lean{...}` and
  `\leanok` get added as each Lean lemma lands. Prose proofs are
  deferred to a phase-end pass. Rationale lives in
  `../blueprint/DESIGN.md` *Recommendation for Phase 6*. We do
  **not** maintain a parallel lemma checklist in this file — the
  dep-graph is the single source of truth, and parallel lists rot.

- **New file `RigidityMatroid.lean`.** Per ROADMAP §6 and DESIGN.md
  *Notion- and matroid-agnostic core* / *Why Henneberg, not matroid*.
  Phase 4 deliberately kept the abstract rigidity matroid out of
  `Framework.lean`; Phase 6 stands the file up alongside it. Lives
  at `CombinatorialRigidity/RigidityMatroid.lean`; imported by
  `LamanTheorem.lean`.

- **Stay matroid-agnostic in the proof body; defer the abstract
  `Matroid` packaging.** The honest minimum surface area for closing
  `exists_isLaman_le` is two linear-algebra ingredients
  (a rank lower bound for generically-rigid placements, and a
  $(2,3)$-sparsity-from-row-independence lemma); neither requires
  `Mathlib.Combinatorics.Matroid`. Building the `Matroid` instance is
  reusable infrastructure but not on the critical path. Defer; revisit
  at end of Phase 6 if it ends up trivial once the supporting
  lemmas land.

- **Lovász–Yemini's "easy direction" only.** Closing
  `exists_isLaman_le` needs only *row-independent in rigidity matroid
  $\Rightarrow$ $(2,3)$-sparse subgraph*. The harder converse
  $(2,3)$-sparse $\Rightarrow$ row-independent at a generic placement
  is the deep half of Lovász–Yemini and is **not needed** for the iff;
  Phase 6 ships without it. If a future phase wants the full
  equality, that's a separate milestone.

- **`TrivialMotions` Phase 4 deferred API may need to land here.**
  The $(2,3)$-sparsity argument uses the rank bound
  $\rk\,R_{H[S]}(p|_S) \le 2|S| - 3$ for $|S| \ge 3$, which goes
  through the affinely-spanning-implies-$\dim\,\mathrm{TrivialMotions} = 3$
  identity (Phase 4 *Lemma checklist*, deferred). Exact form is TBD;
  flagged under *Blockers* below.

## Lemma checklist

**Maintained in the blueprint, not here.** The authoritative checklist
is `chapter/laman-theorem.tex`'s $\Rightarrow$-direction subsection,
visible as a dep-graph at `blueprint/web/dep_graph_document.html`
after `inv bp && inv web`. A red node = not yet formalized; a green
node = formalized and `\leanok`-tagged. Pick leaf-most red.

The first Phase 6 code commit lays out the dep-graph structure; until
then, the only red node is `thm:isGenericallyRigid-exists-isLaman-le`
(the Phase 6 target) and its proof sketch references no intermediate
forward-mode entries yet.

## Blockers / open questions

- **`TrivialMotions` Phase 4 deferred API.** The
  $(2,3)$-sparsity-from-row-independence proof needs
  $\rk\,R_{H[S]}(p|_S) \le 2|S| - 3$ for $|S| \ge 3$ via the
  affinely-spanning identification of trivial motions
  ($\dim\,\mathrm{TrivialMotions} = 3$ when the affine span is 2-dim).
  Three resolution paths in increasing scope:
  1. **Direct lemma**: prove
     $\rk\,\mathrm{range}\,R_G(p) \le 2|V| - 3$ when $p$ affinely
     spans, by exhibiting 3 LI motions in the kernel (translations + one
     rotation), without naming `TrivialMotions`. Smallest scope; mirrors
     the K$_2$ proof shape.
  2. **Resurrect Phase 4's `TrivialMotions` API.** The original
     Phase 4 plan (`notes/Phase4.md` *Lemma checklist*) had
     `trivialMotionAction`, `trivialMotions_le_ker`,
     `finrank_trivialMotions_eq_of_affinelySpanning`. Cost ~60 LoC per
     the Phase 4 estimate; ships a named abstraction.
  3. **Specialize via a concrete placement.** Use the moment-curve
     $p_v = (h\,v, (h\,v)^2)$ for an injection $h : V \to \R$; verify
     all subsets of size $\ge 3$ affinely span. Closed-form linear
     algebra.

  No commitment yet — choose when milestone-2-equivalent dep-graph
  nodes get attempted.

- **Generic-placement affine-spanning lemma.** Phase 4 ships
  `IsInfinitesimallyRigid.eventually` (openness of IR). We may need
  a companion "the IR placements that *also* affinely span on every
  size-$\ge$-3 subset form a dense / nonempty set." Subtlety: an IR
  placement might collapse a subset to a line. Probably true
  generically (the bad set is a finite union of hyperplanes, hence
  meagre); the proof goes through `IsOpen` intersected with the open
  "affinely spanning" set. Mitigation: if the witness placement
  produced by the rank-lower-bound lemma is *customisable* (return
  one that's also affinely-spanning-on-all-subsets), the
  sparsity-side lemma can use that same placement.

- **Linear-algebra basis-pick.** Standard `LinearIndependent.extend`
  or `Basis.extend` should let us pick $2|V| - 3$ LI rows out of the
  rigidity matrix's edge-indexed row family. No-op until the rank
  lower bound lands.

## Hand-off / next phase

**Done:**
- *Commit 0 (`fdbcbd9`):* Phase 6 notes seeded; ROADMAP Status row
  flipped; forward-mode workflow surfaced in top-level `CLAUDE.md`.
- *Commit 1 (`39b2152`):* forward-mode blueprint skeleton for the
  $\Rightarrow$ direction. Six new red nodes in
  `chapter/laman-theorem.tex` with `\uses{...}` chains; no
  `\lean{...}` or `\leanok` yet.
- *Commit 2 (this commit):* bibliography + prose refinement.
  `asimowRoth1978` added to `bibliography.bib` and cited in
  `frameworks.tex` (section preamble) and `laman-theorem.tex` (both
  the $\Rightarrow$ section preamble and the trivial-motions lemma
  preamble). The $\Rightarrow$ section preamble retitled the
  attribution chain: Laman 1970 (the result we prove), Asimow--Roth
  1978 (the linear-algebraic formulation), Jord\'an 2016 Lemma
  1.3.1 (the sparsity step), and Lov\'asz--Yemini 1982 acknowledged
  for the matroid framing of which our (a)+(b) is the easy
  direction. Renders cleanly; [AR78] resolves in both web and print.

**Next concrete commit:** first leaf Lean lemma. Pick the leaf-most
red node in the dep-graph and formalize. Candidates by likely cost:
- `lem:rigidityMap-finrank-range-ge-of-isGenericallyRigid-two` —
  one-liner from `IsInfinitesimallyRigid` + rank-nullity. Lives in
  `RigidityMatroid.lean` (new file).
- `def:edgeSet-rowIndependent` — definition only, no proof
  obligation. Probably bundled with the rank-ge lemma.

**Phase 6 completion is uncertain in scope.** Honest read: the rank
lower bound and the basis-pick are linear-algebra plumbing and
likely close in one session each. The $(2,3)$-sparsity-from-
row-independence lemma contains the only genuinely new mathematical
content and depends on a to-be-chosen path through the *Blockers*
list — that's where most risk lives. Plan to assess scope after the
sparsity-side lemma's first sub-node lands; do not commit to a
one-session full Phase 6 close.
