# Phase 13 — Tutte–Nash-Williams tree-packing (work log)

**Status:** in progress.

This phase specializes Phase 12's Edmonds matroid-partition theorem to
`k` copies of `Graph.cycleMatroid`, recovering the **Tutte–Nash-Williams
tree-packing theorem** (Tutte 1961, Nash-Williams 1961): a multigraph is
the edge-disjoint union of `k` forests iff it is `(k,k)`-sparse, with a
spanning-tree refinement under `(k,k)`-tightness. It is the second link
of the body-bar chain opened in Phase 12:

| Phase | Content |
|---|---|
| 12 (done) | submodular → matroid; matroid union / Edmonds partition |
| **13** (this) | Tutte–Nash-Williams tree-packing; `Graph`-native `(k,ℓ)`-sparsity |
| 14 | `k`-frame matroid = `k`-fold cycle-matroid union (Whiteley Thm 1) |
| 15 | body-bar frameworks + Tay's theorem (existence form) |

**Workflow:** forward-mode. The blueprint chapter
`blueprint/src/chapter/body-bar.tex` (its *Tree-packing as a corollary*
subsection, `def:graph-sparse` through `cor:k-spanning-trees`) is the
authoritative dep-graph and lemma index; this file carries everything
else. The body-bar chapter is shared across Phases 13–15; Phase 13 owns
the `def:graph-sparse` / `thm:unionPow-cycle-indep-iff-sparse` /
`thm:tutte-nash-williams` / `cor:k-spanning-trees` nodes.

## Current state

**Rank adapter landed.** `CombinatorialRigidity/BodyBar/TreePacking.lean`
ships `Matroid.Union_pow_rank_eq` — the constant-family `Set`-side
specialization of the partition formula for `Matroid.Union (fun _ : Fin k ↦
M)`, in `Set`-`Y` / `ℕ` / `Set.ncard` / `[Finite]` idiom (collapses
`∑ᵢ r(Y) = k · r(Y)`, bridges `Finset.univ \ Y`.card ↦ `(univ \ ↑Y).ncard`,
weakens `[Fintype]` ↦ `[Finite]`). Its prerequisite, the indexed partition
formula `Matroid.Union_rank_eq` (the `Fin ι` generalization of
`matroid_partition'`, proved by the same `adjMap_rank_eq` +
`sum'_rk_eq_rk_sum` route), landed beside `matroid_partition'` in
`Matroid/Constructions/Union.lean`. The adapter is generic over `Matroid α`
and does **not** import `Matroid.Graphic`; the `Graph.cycleMatroid` consumer
will apply it with `M := G.cycleMatroid` in the next commit.

The four `body-bar.tex` tree-packing nodes (`def:graph-sparse`,
`thm:unionPow-cycle-indep-iff-sparse`, `thm:tutte-nash-williams`,
`cor:k-spanning-trees`) remain red — the adapter has no dedicated blueprint
node (internal glue). The phase-open commit before this was docs-only.

**Next concrete commit:** `def:graph-sparse` — the `Graph`-native
`(k, ℓ)`-sparsity / tightness predicate, `Set`-side (`Set.ncard` of edge
sets, `ℕ`, `[Finite]`) per `../DESIGN.md` *Set/Finset and rank-flavor
boundary …* item 1, under `namespace Graph` for dot-notation. **First
resolve the `Matroid.Graphic` import blocker** (see Blockers) — the
sparsity predicate references `Graph α β` edge sets and the indep-iff
theorem after it needs `cycleMatroid`, both gated behind that import.

## Architectural choices made up front

- **Carrier = mathlib core `Graph α β`** (the `apnelson1/Matroid`
  `cycleMatroid` carrier), not `SimpleGraph`. Phases 1–11 stay on
  `SimpleGraph`. See `../ROADMAP.md` §13/§15 and `../DESIGN.md`
  *Migrating Phases 1–11 …* (decided against wholesale migration).
- **`Graph`-native `(k,ℓ)`-sparsity is fresh, defined `Set`-side**
  (`Set.ncard` of edge sets, `ℕ`, `[Finite]`) — **not** migrated from
  the Phase 9/10 `SimpleGraph` `IsSparse`. One conversion layer
  (sparsity-count ↔ matroid-rank), not two. See `../DESIGN.md`
  *Set/Finset and rank-flavor boundary …* item 1.
- **Graph-level defs under `namespace Graph`** (dot-notation on
  `G : Graph α β`, beside `Graph.cycleMatroid`). See `../ROADMAP.md` §15.

## Lemma checklist

Leaf-level to-do list is the `body-bar.tex` dep-graph (four red
tree-packing nodes as of phase open).

- [x] **Rank adapter** (no dedicated blueprint node; internal glue) —
  `Matroid.Union_pow_rank_eq`, `Set`/`ℕ`/`ncard`/`[Finite]` restatement of
  the partition formula for the constant `k`-fold union, in
  `BodyBar/TreePacking.lean`. Built generic over `Matroid α` (cycleMatroid
  is its first consumer, applied directly). Its prerequisite
  `Matroid.Union_rank_eq` (indexed generalization of `matroid_partition'`)
  landed in `Matroid/Constructions/Union.lean`.
- [ ] `def:graph-sparse` — `Graph` `(k,ℓ)`-sparsity + tightness,
  `Set`-side.
- [ ] `thm:unionPow-cycle-indep-iff-sparse` — independence in the
  `k`-fold cycle-matroid union ⟺ `(k,k)`-sparse (Whiteley Cor 3).
- [ ] `thm:tutte-nash-williams` — edge-disjoint union of `k` forests ⟺
  `(k,k)`-sparse.
- [ ] `cor:k-spanning-trees` — under `(k,k)`-tightness the `k` forests
  are spanning trees.

## Decisions made during this phase

<none yet — phase just opened. Flat list is fine for a phase this size;
sub-organize only if it grows cleanup passes.>

## Blockers / open questions

- **`Matroid.Graphic` import is currently broken (NEW, blocks next commit).**
  Importing `Matroid.Graphic` (the `cycleMatroid` source) transitively
  pulls `apnelson1/Matroid`'s `Matroid/Uniform/Basic.lean`, which fails to
  build at the pinned package revision under the current mathlib pin —
  `unifOn_rankPos_iff` (line 104) has a `simp` that no longer closes its
  goal (`unsolved goals` + two unused-simp-arg warnings on line 105). This
  is an upstream vendored-package breakage, not a project API gap. Options
  for the next commit: (a) bump the `apnelson1/Matroid` pin to a revision
  where `Uniform/Basic.lean` builds; (b) if no such revision, port the few
  `cycleMatroid` facts we need (`cycleMatroid_indep` = `IsAcyclicSet`, the
  rank-as-`|V|−c` form) into the local `CombinatorialRigidity/Matroid/`
  tree against a constructor that doesn't drag in `Uniform/Basic`. The
  rank adapter sidesteps this — it is `Matroid α`-generic and needs no
  Graphic import — but `def:graph-sparse` and everything downstream needs
  `Graph α β` / `cycleMatroid`.
- **`Graph.cycleMatroid` rank formula.** `thm:unionPow-cycle-indep-iff-sparse`
  needs `r(E') = |V'| − c(E')` on the cycle matroid. `Graphic.lean` exposes
  `cycleMatroid_indep` (= `IsAcyclicSet`), `cycleMatroid_isBase`
  (= `IsMaximalAcyclicSet`), `cycleMatroid_isBasis`, and an `eRk + 1 =
  |V|.encard` connected-component form (line ~235); confirm the precise
  `|V'| − c(E')` shape once the import blocker above is cleared.
- **`k`-fold union shape — RESOLVED.** The adapter phrases the `k`-fold
  union as `Matroid.Union (fun _ : Fin k ↦ M)` (single `Matroid.Union`
  over a constant `Fin k` family), which the `adjMap_rank_eq` +
  `sum'_rk_eq_rk_sum` route consumes cleanly; the `∑ᵢ → k·` collapse is
  one `Finset.sum_const` step.
