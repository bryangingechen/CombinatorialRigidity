# Phase 23d — Case III general `d`: the CHAIN rank-certification reconsideration (work log)

**Status:** in progress (opened 2026-06-24 at a user-adjudicated clean-break close of 23c, at the
member-mapping-wall STOP). **Phase 23 stays in progress**; 23d is the third CHAIN-layer sub-phase
(CHAIN spans 23b + 23c + 23d, design §3). ENTRY + ASSEMBLY are later sub-phases (codes). The full
23d route history — every wall + verdict — lives in `notes/Phase23-design.md` §I.8.24(4.18)–(4.30);
program map `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`; the 23c landed-leaf inventory is `notes/Phase23c.md`.

**What 23d is.** 23c built option (A) (the `±r`-block rank-cert engine) end-to-end + closed the
interior-`hρe₀` conjecture-crux, but the general-`d` rank cert hit the `hρGv` member-mapping wall. 23d
reconsiders the rank cert. The genuine-row base-block family (route B, route 4-bare, route 4-splitOff)
was built/scoped and **all walled on the same obstruction**: the wrap edge `edge i` content cannot
enter the corner-overridden `caseIIICandidate` span — the discriminator gate `ρ₀ ⊥̸ C(vᵢ₊₁, n')` is
**intrinsic to the slot-override, invariant under base-block re-targeting** (4 wall appearances,
§(4.18)–(4.29)). So the user chose **route A** — the honest unconditional concrete-`Matrix` Theorem 5.5.
All landed leaves stay in tree (sound in isolation; the route-B/4 inventory is reusable or harmless).
`d=3` stays fully green throughout.

## Current state

**✅ NEXT = the `hA` corner LI bridge (§(4.34) leaf 2), then the dispatch wiring (item 2). `hD`
(leaf 1) is LANDED.** The bottom-block LI bridge `linearIndependent_toBlocks₂₂_row_of_off_pin`
(`Concrete.lean`, 2026-06-25, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean, `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`
only) discharges the cert's `hD` from the IH full-rank fact: the operated (6.64) bottom block IS the
un-operated `R(Gᵥ,q)` submatrix (the column op only touches the pin `v`'s coordinate, invisible to a
`Gᵥ`-row whose endpoints avoid `v`), so its row-LI = the IH-restricted un-operated submatrix row-LI.
Supporting bricks (all `Concrete.lean`): the matrix-equality core `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₂₂_eq`,
the entrywise off-pin equality `rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_apply_off_pin`, and the un-operated
entry read `rigidityMatrixEdge_apply`. The A6 ARM SPINE
`case_III_arm_realization_matrix` is LANDED sorry-free (`CaseIII/Relabel/ForkedArm.lean`,
2026-06-25) — the route-A sibling of `_chain`, carrying the matrix block data `(m₁, m₂, hm₁, hm₂, re,
hbot, hA, hD)` as hypotheses (the standing carry-the-crux idiom) and CONSTRUCTING `U`/`hU`/`en`/`hblock`
in-body off the landed bricks: `U := (toMatrix' (prodColumnOpEquiv (columnOp hva).symm))ᵀ`,
`en := (columnSplit v).symm`, `hblock` a one-line `Matrix.fromBlocks_toBlocks` rewrite via the landed
0-block kernel `rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_submatrix_toBlocks₂₁_eq_zero`. It calls
`case_III_rank_certification_matrix` for `hrank`, then the route-agnostic tail
`case_III_realization_of_rank` (unchanged); conclusion byte-identical to `_chain`. **The A6-assembly
RECON verdict (session #34): the arm composes sorry-free, but `hA`/`hD` are TWO genuinely-new
dual-space→matrix-row LI bridges — NOT the ~1-leaf gate facts the row-473 prose claimed** (see
*Decisions made*). `_chain` stays in tree (parallel, sound); the dispatch wires whichever arm later
(item 2). The `D−2`-surplus obstruction (§(4.33)(3)) is structurally dissolved (`re` drops the surplus
`v`-rows, the SUBSPACE shape KT's (6.64) states).

**✅ ROUTE A is the plan; the full A1–A5c + cert + (4b′) kernel + A6-fix leaf chain is LANDED +
gate-verified** — opacity CLEAN throughout (the bridge runs through `Basis`/`LinearEquiv`, never
unfolding `ScrewSpace`; the §(4.30) residual RESOLVED). The canonical landed inventory (all
2026-06-24/25, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean — per-leaf prose in git + *Decisions made* + design

| A6 `hD` (leaf 1) | `rigidityMatrixEdge_apply` (un-operated entry read) + `rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_apply_off_pin` (operated = un-operated off the pin, for a row avoiding `v`) + `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₂₂_eq` (the (6.64) bottom block IS the un-operated `R(Gᵥ,q)` submatrix) + `linearIndependent_toBlocks₂₂_row_of_off_pin` (the `hD` bridge: IH-restricted un-operated submatrix row-LI ⟹ `toBlocks₂₂.row` LI) | `Concrete.lean` |

Everything is carrier-agnostic — **no `ScrewSpace` unfolding** anywhere (route A's escape from the
§(4.18)–(4.30) span-membership wall: KT's (6.61) is a unit-det right-multiply, never a membership).

**✅ The ROUTE-A CERT is now LANDED** (`PanelHingeFramework.case_III_rank_certification_matrix`,
`CaseIII/Candidate.lean`, 2026-06-25, full-build/lint/warning/axiom-clean) — the abstract block-data
drop-in for `case_III_rank_certification_chain`. It takes the candidate framework `caseIIICandidate G
ends q e_a e_b (q(a,·)) n' n_b 0`, its edge-restricted GP/link hyps (`hgp`/`hends` over `G.edgeSet`),
the (6.61)→(6.64) matrix block data (`U`/`hU`/`em`/`en`/`hblock`/`hA`/`hD`), and the cardinality facts
(`hm₁ : #m₁ = D`, `hm₂ : #m₂ = D·(|V_Gv|−1)`) + count facts (`hVone`/`hVcard`), and produces the
honest target `screwDim k · (|V(G)|−1) ≤ finrank (span (caseIIICandidate …).rigidityRows)` — the SAME
conclusion form `_chain` has, so it is a drop-in at the arm's `hrank` seam. Body: fire the landed A5c
composition core `finrank_span_rigidityRows_ge_of_edge_fromBlocks` (`F₀.graph = G` is `rfl`, so the
edge-restricted hyps transport), then the `_chain` count arithmetic. The block data + cardinalities
enter as hypotheses (the standing "carry the crux as `h…`" idiom; the geometry is the arm's burden,
A6) — exactly paralleling how `_chain` consumed `(W, g, hWS, hWcard, hιcard, hg, hLI)`. New import
edge `Candidate.lean → RigidityMatrix.Concrete` (acyclic; full build green).

**✅ A6 DIRECTION CHOSEN — option (4b′) (user-adjudicated 2026-06-25, session #33), resolving the
cert-SHAPE obstruction the §(4.33) spike surfaced (diagnosis retained below).**
The corrected-`hblock` spike (design §(4.33), 2026-06-25) settled the §(4.32) index map AND surfaced a
deeper obstruction:

* **The §(4.32) corner index map was GARBLED — corner pin is `v = (ends e_b).1`, NOT `a`.** So
  `en := columnSplit v` (not `columnSplit a`), and the lower-left `0` block reads off a NEW FIXED-pin
  brick (`…_apply_pin_zero`, the bottom rows vanishing at the FIXED `v`'s columns), NOT the per-row-keyed
  `…_apply_eq_zero_of_ne` (which keys the op on each row's OWN endpoints — sound, but the wrong op for a
  single `fromBlocks` block). **Three corrected bricks LANDED sorry-free** (A6-fix row above):
  `…_apply_pin_zero` (the `0` block), `…_apply_corner` (the `hA` content), `…_reindex_toBlocks₂₁_eq_zero`
  (the (4b) `toBlocks₂₁=0` reduction via `Matrix.fromBlocks_toBlocks`, given the bottom rows avoid `v`).
* **THE OBSTRUCTION: the cert's `fromBlocks A B 0 D` shape — a TOTAL row bijection `em : (…)≃ m₁ ⊕ m₂`
  with BOTH diagonal blocks full-row-LI — is UNSATISFIABLE on the real isostatic arm for `D ≥ 3` (all
  general `d`).** For minimal-0-dof `G` the edge count is ISOSTATIC (`(D−1)|E| = D(|V|−1)`), so `em` is a
  total bijection of all edge rows. The `v`-incident rows are `e_a` + `e_b` = `2(D−1)`; the corner `m₁`
  holds `D`; the surplus `2(D−1)−D = D−2` `v`-rows are FORCED into `m₂`. After the op they are
  pure-`v`-column (zero on `n₂`, nonzero on `n₁`), so they make `toBlocks₂₂` have zero rows (⟹ `hD` FALSE)
  AND `toBlocks₂₁ ≠ 0` (⟹ the `0` block FALSE). KT's (6.64) is a SUBSPACE statement (the surplus rows
  IGNORED) — which is why the dual cert uses `finrank_…_of_corner` (`mkQ` subspace+family, NO partition);
  the matrix cert's total-bijection `fromBlocks` is a strictly stronger shape that demands the WHOLE edge
  matrix be full-row-rank at `F₀`, which is FALSE (the `D−2` surplus rows are dependent at the `t=0` shear).
* **`hD`/`hA` are NOT the blocker — they are ~1-leaf gate facts (NO hard relabel).** This cert is stated
  for a SINGLE generic split `(v,a,b)`, `Gv = G.removeVertex v` (the IH base, NOT a chain-relabelled
  candidate — the interior-`i` relabel `chainData_bottom_relabel` is UPSTREAM in `chainData_dispatch`,
  item 2). So the bottom block's rows are `F₀`'s own `Gv`-edge rows (= `R(Gv,q)` rows, the `v`-override
  doesn't touch them); their row-LI is the IH `Gv`-realization full-rank, a gate fact via the A5b iff +
  unit-det `U` + reindex (all LI-preserving). `hA` = `omitTwoExtensor`/`interior_group` (PROBE C content).
  Both dischargeable **only in the SUBSPACE/row-SUBSET shape**, NOT the cert's total-bijection shape.

**✅ The A6 ARM SPINE is LANDED — `case_III_arm_realization_matrix`** (`CaseIII/Relabel/ForkedArm.lean`,
2026-06-25, full-build/lint/warning/axiom-clean, `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` only). The
route-A sibling of `case_III_arm_realization_chain`: same split-data/`Gv`/count/`q`-normal signature
(+ `[Fintype α] [DecidableEq α]`) carrying the matrix block data `(m₁, m₂, hm₁, hm₂, re, hbot, hA, hD)`
as hypotheses (mirroring how `_chain` carries `(W, g, …)`); CONSTRUCTS `U`/`hU`/`en`/`hblock` in-body
off the landed bricks; calls `case_III_rank_certification_matrix` for `hrank`, then the route-agnostic
tail `case_III_realization_of_rank`. Conclusion byte-identical to `_chain`. **NEXT = the two carried
gate facts `hA`/`hD`** (the §(4.34) dual-space→matrix-row LI bridges) then the dispatch wiring (item 2).
`_chain` stays in tree (parallel, sound); the dispatch wires whichever arm later.

**DIRECTION CHOSEN — (4b′) (user-adjudicated 2026-06-25, session #33):** row-submatrix reshape
(~2–3 leaves). DECLINED: (4a) `D := R(G₁,q₁)` relabelled IH matrix (~3–5 leaves, hard); (C) documented
fallback (carry the rank-cert obligation as one hypothesis, ~1 leaf + wiring; abandons the unconditional
Thm 5.5).

## Remaining work in Phase 23

1. **The general-`d` rank certification — route A (concrete `Matrix`).** ✅
   A1+A2+A3+A4+A4.5+A5a+A5b + A5c-keystone + A5c operated-entry facts + A4.5e (the edge-restricted
   matrix) + the A5c composition core (`finrank_span_rigidityRows_ge_of_edge_fromBlocks`) + the `en`
   column split (`columnSplit`) + the `em` panel-row split (`edgeRowSplit`) + the ROUTE-A CERT
   `case_III_rank_certification_matrix` (`CaseIII/Candidate.lean`, the abstract block-data drop-in for
   `_chain`) + the EDGE-restricted operated-entry facts + the CORRECTED §(4.33) index-map bricks
   (`rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_apply_pin_zero`/`..._apply_corner`/`..._reindex_toBlocks₂₁_eq_zero`)
   landed. **The (4b′) row-SUBMATRIX kernel reshape is LANDED THROUGH THE CERT** (2026-06-25): the
   bridge `Matrix.rank_ge_of_isUnit_mul_submatrix_fromBlocks` (`Rank.lean`, row injection `re :
   m₁ ⊕ m₂ → rows` + col equiv `en`, `(M*U).submatrix re en = fromBlocks A B 0 D` ⟹ `#m₁+#m₂ ≤
   M.rank`) + its composition core `…_finrank_span_rigidityRows_ge_of_edge_submatrix_fromBlocks`
   (`Concrete.lean`) were landed last session, and now the cert `case_III_rank_certification_matrix`
   (`Candidate.lean`) is **reshaped to fire that core** (`_of_edge_fromBlocks` →
   `_of_edge_submatrix_fromBlocks`, the `em ≃` → `re` injection, `en` flipped, `.reindex em en` →
   `.submatrix re en`; conclusion byte-identical to `_chain`). These drop the `D−2` surplus `v`-rows
   that made the total-`em`-bijection `fromBlocks` UNSATISFIABLE for `D ≥ 3` (design §(4.33)(3)).
   **The A6 `hblock` 0-block reduction kernel is LANDED** (2026-06-25):
   `rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_submatrix_toBlocks₂₁_eq_zero` (`Concrete.lean`) — the
   row-injection analogue of `…_reindex_toBlocks₂₁_eq_zero` in the cert's exact submatrix shape, so
   the cert's `hblock` is now a one-line `fromBlocks_toBlocks` rewrite. **The A6 ARM SPINE
   `case_III_arm_realization_matrix` is LANDED** (`ForkedArm.lean`, 2026-06-25, the route-A sibling of
   `_chain`, constructing `U`/`hU`/`en`/`hblock` in-body and carrying `(m₁, m₂, hm₁, hm₂, re, hbot,
   hA, hD)`). **`hD` (leaf 1) is LANDED** (`linearIndependent_toBlocks₂₂_row_of_off_pin`,
   `Concrete.lean`); **NEXT = the `hA` corner gate fact** (the §(4.34) corner LI bridge
   `…_toBlocks₁₁_row_of_corner_gate`), then the
   dispatch (item 2) discharges `(re, hbot, hA, hD)` + wires the arm. `_chain` stays in tree (parallel,
   sound). Option (4b′) is CHOSEN (user-adjudicated 2026-06-25;
   options (4a)/(C) declined). The route-B/4 dual-space leaves + the chain cert
   `case_III_rank_certification_chain` stay in tree (sound in isolation — the dual-space approach the
   wall closed; do not build on them). The interior-`hρe₀` crux is CLOSED.
2. **CHAIN-2c-iii `chainData_dispatch`** — the general-`k` `Fin cd.d` router (base/`d=3` via
   `chainData_split_realization`; interior `2 ≤ i < d` via the route-A arm). The `ChainData`
   interior-split accessors are landed and reusable: `removeVertex_isLink_edge_succ_pred_off`
   (`Induction/Operations.lean`, the off-slot input), the interior-`hρe₀` chain
   `interior_hρe₀_of_baseWidening`/`_of_widening` (`CaseIII/Relabel/ForkedArm.lean`, the dispatch reads
   `hρe₀` off LEAF-3's `hedgeGv` in one call), and LEAF-3
   `exists_shared_redundancy_and_matched_candidate` (`CaseIII/Realization.lean`, re-exposes `hedgeGv`).
   Folds into A6. GAP 2: the `ends`-orientation pins need a `Function.update` override (LEAF-3's
   `ends = Q.ends` is only orientation-free).
3. **CHAIN-5** — wire the dispatch into the spine to discharge `hdispatch`.
4. **ENTRY** *(parallel-safe; own sub-phase when minted)* — reshape `Graph.exists_chain_data_of_noRigid`
   (`Reduction.lean:383`) to the `G.ChainData n` producer `exists_chainData_of_noRigid` (KT Lemma 4.6
   chain + Lemma 4.8 split-off, general `d`); lift the `6 ≤ bodyBarDim n` floor; resolve the chain/cycle
   dichotomy (OD-1, KT Lemma 4.6 / Lemma 5.4). Consumer: `case_III_hsplit_producer_all_k`
   (`Arms.lean:777`). The CHAIN↔ENTRY contract is frozen (below).
5. **ASSEMBLY** — compose the honest general-`d` Theorem 5.5, re-green `prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` +
   `hub`, derive Thm 5.6, state Conjecture 1.2.

**Contract/motive note.** No C.0–C.6/motive change is forced (§I.8.21 confirmed). Route A re-shapes the
rank cert + arm realization only — not the dispatch's `hdispatch` consume-shape (C.3), the `ChainData`
record (C.1), or the 0-dof motive/IH.

## CHAIN↔ENTRY chain-data contract (frozen)

The `G.ChainData n` contract (the length-`d` chain record) is **frozen** — design `notes/Phase23-design.md`
§"CHAIN↔ENTRY contract", C.0–C.6; no motive/IH change; `d=3` zero-regression. The dispatch's input shape is
the chain extractor's output shape, so ENTRY can be built independently against this frozen contract.

## Blueprint-clarity obligation (carried from 23b/23c — owner-flagged)

The `lem:case-III` general-`d` node's exposition must materialize KT's index-shift isos (6.54–6.56) + ±r
chain (6.66) explicitly (the Lean economizes; the prose must not), and present the redundancy-carry as
**whole-matrix bookkeeping with `r` abstract and the member moving**, flagging the fixed-functional-transport
shape as the trap (the §(4.21) source-recon framing). Written at phase-close once the arm is `sorry`-free.
Ledger entry: `notes/BlueprintExposition.md` (`lem:case-III general-d`).

## Hand-off / next phase

**✅ The corrected-`hblock` index map is SETTLED + three corrected bricks are LANDED** (`Concrete.lean`,
2026-06-25, full-build/lint/warning/axiom-clean, `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` only):
`rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_apply_pin_zero` (the FIXED-pin-`v` lower-left `0` block),
`..._apply_corner` (the `D × D` corner entry = panel functional on `v`'s columns, the `hA` content),
`..._reindex_toBlocks₂₁_eq_zero` (the (4b) `toBlocks₂₁ = 0` reduction via `Matrix.fromBlocks_toBlocks`,
given the bottom rows avoid `v`). The §(4.32) corner index map was GARBLED — corner pin is
`v = (ends e_b).1`, NOT `a`; `en := columnSplit v` (not `columnSplit a`); and the old per-row-keyed
`..._apply_eq_zero_of_ne` (sound, kept in tree) is the wrong vanishing for the `fromBlocks` `0` block.
On top of A1–A5c + the cert + composition core + `columnSplit`/`edgeRowSplit`/`U`/`hU`.

**✅ A6 DIRECTION = option (4b′), user-adjudicated 2026-06-25 (session #33) — the cert-SHAPE obstruction
the §(4.33) spike surfaced is resolved by the row-submatrix reshape below; obstruction trace retained.**
The cert `case_III_rank_certification_matrix`'s `fromBlocks A B 0 D` shape — a TOTAL row bijection
`em : (…) ≃ m₁ ⊕ m₂` with BOTH diagonal blocks full-row-LI — is UNSATISFIABLE on the isostatic arm for
`D ≥ 3` (all general `d`): the `D−2` surplus `v`-incident rows (forced into `m₂` since the corner `m₁`
holds only `D` of the `2(D−1)` `e_a`+`e_b` rows) are pure-`v`-column after the op, so they break BOTH
`toBlocks₂₁ = 0` (nonzero on `v`-columns) AND `hD` (zero rows in `toBlocks₂₂`). KT's (6.64) is a
SUBSPACE statement that IGNORES the surplus — which is why the dual cert uses `finrank_…_of_corner`
(`mkQ` subspace+family, no row partition), and the matrix cert's total-bijection `fromBlocks` is a
strictly stronger, unsatisfiable shape. **`hD`/`hA` themselves are NOT the blocker** — they are ~1-leaf
gate facts (this cert is the SINGLE-split `(v,a,b)` form, `Gv = G.removeVertex v` the direct IH base,
NOT a chain-relabelled candidate → NO hard `chainData_bottom_relabel` matrix analogue; that relabel is
UPSTREAM in `chainData_dispatch`, item 2). Full kernel trace + the surplus-row count: design §(4.33)(3)/(4).

**✅ The (4b′) row-SUBMATRIX kernel reshape is LANDED THROUGH THE CERT** (2026-06-25, `Rank.lean`
+ `Concrete.lean` + `Candidate.lean`, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean, `[propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound]` only). The row-submatrix variant of A4
`Matrix.rank_ge_of_isUnit_mul_submatrix_fromBlocks` (row **injection** `re : m₁ ⊕ m₂ → rows`, not
the unsatisfiable total `em ≃`; col equiv `en : (n₁ ⊕ n₂) ≃ q`; `(M*U).submatrix re en = fromBlocks
A B 0 D` ⟹ `#m₁ + #m₂ ≤ M.rank` via `Matrix.rank_submatrix_le`, no injectivity needed) + its
rigidity composition core `…_finrank_span_rigidityRows_ge_of_edge_submatrix_fromBlocks` were landed
last session, and now the cert `case_III_rank_certification_matrix` **fires that row-submatrix core**:
its `em ≃` parameter became `re : m₁ ⊕ m₂ → ({e // e ∈ E(G)} × Fin (D−1))`, `en` flipped to
`(n₁ ⊕ n₂) ≃ (α × Fin D)`, `hblock`'s `.reindex em en` became `.submatrix re en`, the body calls
`…_of_edge_submatrix_fromBlocks`. Conclusion byte-identical to `_chain` (still a `hrank`-seam
drop-in). These select the `D` corner rows + the `D·(|V_Gv|−1)` `v`-clean `Gv`-bottom rows and DROP
the `D−2` surplus `v`-rows — the SUBSPACE shape KT's (6.64) actually states, structurally dissolving
the §(4.33)(3) cert-shape obstruction.

**✅ The A6 `hblock` 0-block reduction kernel is LANDED** (`rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_submatrix_
toBlocks₂₁_eq_zero`, `Concrete.lean`, 2026-06-25, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean): the
row-*injection* analogue of the reindex-form brick, stated in the cert's exact submatrix shape
(`re : m₁ ⊕ m₂ → rows`, `en := (columnSplit v).symm`). So the cert's
`hblock : (… * U).submatrix re en = fromBlocks A B 0 D` is now a one-line `Matrix.fromBlocks_toBlocks`
rewrite (`A := toBlocks₁₁`, `B := toBlocks₁₂`, `D := toBlocks₂₂`; the composition was verified
in-session). The corner content `A` is read off `…_apply_corner`.

**✅ The A6 ARM SPINE is LANDED** (`case_III_arm_realization_matrix`, `ForkedArm.lean`, 2026-06-25) —
the route-A sibling of `_chain` carrying the matrix block data as hypotheses + constructing
`U`/`hU`/`en`/`hblock` in-body (the spike's sorry-free composition banked). `_chain` stays in tree
(parallel, sound).

**✅ `hD` (leaf 1) is LANDED** — `linearIndependent_toBlocks₂₂_row_of_off_pin` (`Concrete.lean`,
2026-06-25, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean). The bridge takes the IH-restricted **un-operated**
submatrix row-LI hypothesis `hIH : LinearIndependent ℝ ((rigidityMatrixEdge).submatrix (re ∘ Sum.inr)
((columnSplit v).symm ∘ Sum.inr)).row` and produces the cert's `hD : LinearIndependent ℝ
(…).toBlocks₂₂.row`, via the matrix-equality core `submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₂₂_eq` (the operated
(6.64) bottom block IS the un-operated `R(Gᵥ,q)` submatrix, since the column op only touches body
`v`'s coordinate, invisible to a row whose endpoints avoid `v`). The remaining IH-rank → `hIH` step
(the dispatch's burden, item 2) is the un-operated `R(Gᵥ,q)` full-rank consequence restricted to the
matched rows/columns. NOTE: came in cleaner than the design's `rank_eq_finrank_span_row` route —
the un-operated→operated equality makes `hD` a pure submatrix-restriction of the IH, no Gram/rank
detour needed.

**NEXT CONCRETE LEAF = `hA` (leaf 2)** — the `D×D` corner LI bridge
`linearIndependent_toBlocks₁₁_row_of_corner_gate`. Rewrite entries via the landed
`rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_apply_corner` to `(blockBasisOn)(finScrewBasis c)` (needs the
corner `re ∘ Sum.inl` endpoints `(v,a)`/`(v,b)` — a structural fact on `re`), then port
`linearIndependent_mkQ_corner_of_gate` to matrix-row form. **GUARD the `caseIIICandidate` whnf — §38**
(the spike hit a 200000-heartbeat timeout on a naive `linearIndependent_row_of_coordEquiv`; use
`apply` with explicit carrier, never `simp`/`whnf` on `F₀`).

Then **the dispatch wiring (item 2)** — `chainData_dispatch` discharges `(re, hbot, hA, hD)` from the
`ChainData` interior split (the way it discharges `_chain`'s `(W, g)`), and wires whichever arm. Then
ENTRY + ASSEMBLY (parallel-safe). The exact `hA`/`hD` residual goals + the leaf signatures: design
§I.8.24(4.34).

**DIRECTION CHOSEN — (4b′) (user-adjudicated 2026-06-25, session #33):** row-submatrix reshape
(~2–3 leaves). DECLINED: (4a) `D := R(G₁,q₁)` relabelled IH matrix (forces the hard
`chainData_bottom_relabel` matrix analogue NOW, ~3–5 leaves, hard); (C) documented fallback (carry the
rank-cert obligation as one hypothesis, ~1 leaf + wiring; abandons the unconditional Thm 5.5). **No
motive/IH change** (within route A). Full options + signatures: design §I.8.24(4.33)(5).

**The route-A build should open as its own sub-phase at the next phase-open** (A1–A5c confirm route A
on track; the corrected A6 layer plan is in *Current state* + §(4.33), superseding §(4.32)'s garbled
index map; the new Lean lives in
`Molecular/RigidityMatrix/Concrete.lean` + the upstream-eligible `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean`
+ further `RigidityMatrix/` files). Route (C) (honest-conditional — carry the rank-cert obligation as one
explicit hypothesis, ~1 leaf + wiring, gap = KT's own (6.61) "not difficult to see") is the documented
fallback only if route A later walls.

**Do NOT re-attempt** the closed genuine-row base-block routes (B, 4-bare, 4-splitOff) or the dual-space
rank-cert variants — the wall (the discriminator gate intrinsic to the `caseIIICandidate` slot-override)
is kernel-confirmed across all of them (§(4.18)–(4.29)); route A escapes via the literal-`Matrix` model
(where KT's (6.61) is a column-op equality, never a span membership), not by re-targeting the base block.

## Decisions made during this phase

*(Fresh at open. The 23c landed-leaf inventory + wall-characterization is the settled archive in
`notes/Phase23c.md`; the full 23d route history — every wall, spike, and verdict — is
`notes/Phase23-design.md` §I.8.24(4.18)–(4.30). This section keeps the live route-A decisions + one
compressed history verdict; the per-leaf landed-route-B descriptions are in git + the design doc.)*

- **A6 `hD` LEAF (leaf 1) LANDED — `linearIndependent_toBlocks₂₂_row_of_off_pin` (2026-06-25,
  `Concrete.lean`, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean; `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` only).**
  The cert's `hD` from the IH full-rank, via the **op-invariance of the bottom block**: the column op
  `Φ.symm = columnOp hva` only updates body `v`'s screw coordinate, invisible to a `Gᵥ`-row whose
  endpoints both avoid `v`, so the operated (6.64) block `toBlocks₂₂` IS the un-operated `R(Gᵥ,q)`
  submatrix (`submatrix_columnOp_toBlocks₂₂_eq`, entrywise off the brick
  `rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_apply_off_pin` + the un-operated read `rigidityMatrixEdge_apply`).
  Hence `hD` is a pure submatrix-restriction of the IH row-LI — **cleaner than the design's
  `rank_eq_finrank_span_row` route** (no Gram/rank detour). The remaining IH-rank → `hIH` step is the
  dispatch's burden (item 2). Friction: `rw` with an explicit lemma rewrites only the first matched
  occurrence (the dual `columnOp` reads at both endpoints) → `simp only` to fixpoint
  (→ FRICTION [idiom]). NEXT = `hA` (leaf 2).
- **A6 ARM SPINE LANDED + A6-assembly RECON verdict (2026-06-25, `ForkedArm.lean`,
  build/lint/warning/axiom-clean; `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` only).**
  `case_III_arm_realization_matrix` — the route-A sibling of `_chain`: same split-data/count signature
  (+ `[Fintype α] [DecidableEq α]`), carrying the matrix block data `(m₁, m₂, hm₁, hm₂, re, hbot, hA, hD)`
  (carry-the-crux), CONSTRUCTING `U`/`hU`/`en`/`hblock` in-body (the spike's sorry-free composition
  banked), calling the cert then the shared tail. **RECON (compiler-checked spike): the arm composes
  sorry-free, but `hA`/`hD` are TWO genuinely-new dual-space→matrix-row LI bridges, NOT the row-473
  "~1-leaf gate facts".** `hD` needs a "`Gv` span-finrank `= card` ⟹ `toBlocks₂₂.row` LI" bridge
  (`rank_eq_finrank_span_row` + `linearIndependent_rows_iff_rank_eq_card`, `Mathlib/.../Rank.lean`);
  `hA` needs a "corner-gate dual-LI ⟹ `toBlocks₁₁.row` LI" bridge porting
  `linearIndependent_mkQ_corner_of_gate` — GUARD the `caseIIICandidate` whnf (§38; the spike hit a
  200000-heartbeat timeout on a naive `linearIndependent_row_of_coordEquiv`). Exact residual goals +
  decomposition: design §I.8.24(4.34). No new friction (the `ᵀ` notation isn't in scope in
  `ForkedArm.lean` → wrote `Matrix.transpose`; recurrence of the scoped-notation idiom, no new entry).
- **A6 `hblock` 0-BLOCK REDUCTION KERNEL — LANDED (2026-06-25, `Concrete.lean`,
  build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).** `rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_submatrix_toBlocks₂₁_eq_zero`:
  the row-*injection* analogue of `…_reindex_toBlocks₂₁_eq_zero`, stated in the cert's exact
  submatrix shape — any `re : m₁ ⊕ m₂ → ({e // e ∈ E(G)} × Fin (D−1))` whose bottom rows
  (`re ∘ Sum.inr`) avoid the FIXED pin `v`, with `en := (columnSplit v).symm`, gives
  `((… * U).submatrix re en).toBlocks₂₁ = 0` (each entry = `…_apply_pin_zero` at the `(v,c)` corner
  column). The reindex-form brick only fires for a row *equivalence* (`em.symm`), unusable for the
  cert's injection `re`; this fills that gap. With it the cert's `hblock` is a one-line
  `Matrix.fromBlocks_toBlocks` rewrite (`A/B/D := toBlocks₁₁/₁₂/₂₂`; verified in-session). Shrunk to
  fit one sitting — banks the `hblock`-producing kernel SORRY-FREE; the remaining A6 work is the
  geometry (`re` construction + `hA`/`hD` LI facts). No new friction (verbatim structural mirror of
  the landed reindex brick: drop `reindex_apply`, swap the row Equiv for the injection).
- **(4b′) CERT RESHAPED TO THE ROW-SUBMATRIX CORE — LANDED (2026-06-25, `Candidate.lean`,
  build/lint/warning/axiom-clean; `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` only).** The cert
  `case_III_rank_certification_matrix` now fires the landed row-submatrix composition core: its
  `em : (…) ≃ m₁ ⊕ m₂` parameter became the row injection `re : m₁ ⊕ m₂ → ({e // e ∈ E(G)} ×
  Fin (D−1))`, `en` flipped to `(n₁ ⊕ n₂) ≃ (α × Fin D)` (the `_submatrix` core's direction),
  `hblock`'s `.reindex em en` became `.submatrix re en`, and the body calls
  `…_of_edge_submatrix_fromBlocks`. Conclusion byte-identical to `_chain` (still a drop-in at the
  `hrank` seam); the `D−2`-surplus obstruction is now structurally dissolved (the `re` injection
  drops the surplus `v`-rows). Mechanical reshape — no `change`/`show`, no rewrite chains. Shrunk to
  fit one sitting (the cert→core swap is self-contained; the A6 geometry that instantiates
  `re`/`hblock`/`hA`/`hD` is the MED–HIGH crux, next). No new friction (the only signal was a
  long-line linter warning in the doc comment, reflowed). NEXT = the A6 geometry inputs.
- **(4b′) ROW-SUBMATRIX KERNEL RESHAPE — HALF-LANDED (2026-06-25, `Rank.lean` + `Concrete.lean`,
  build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).** Two leaves resolving the §(4.33)(3) cert-shape obstruction at
  the kernel: `Matrix.rank_ge_of_isUnit_mul_submatrix_fromBlocks` (the A4 bridge with a row
  INJECTION `re : m₁ ⊕ m₂ → rows` + col equiv `en`, `(M*U).submatrix re en = fromBlocks A B 0 D` ⟹
  `#m₁+#m₂ ≤ M.rank`) + its rigidity composition core `…_finrank_span_rigidityRows_ge_of_edge_
  submatrix_fromBlocks`. Both are mechanical mirrors of the landed `_reindex`/`_of_edge_fromBlocks`
  pair with `Matrix.rank_submatrix_le` (NO injectivity needed — a row submatrix only drops rank)
  swapped for the rank-preserving `rank_reindex`; this lets the cert select the `D` corner + the
  `D·(|V_Gv|−1)` IH-bottom rows and DROP the `D−2` surplus `v`-rows. Shrunk to fit one sitting (the
  cert reshape + the `re`/`hblock` geometry assembly is the MED–HIGH crux; this banks the
  carrier-agnostic kernel half SORRY-FREE). No new friction (exact mirrors of landed lemmas; the
  `rank_submatrix_le` no-injectivity is the only mathematically-load-bearing change). NEXT = the cert
  reshape (`case_III_rank_certification_matrix` → fire `…_submatrix…`) + the A6 geometry.
- **CORRECTED-`hblock` SPIKE — 3 index-map bricks LANDED + the cert-shape obstruction FLAGGED
  (2026-06-25, `Concrete.lean`, full-build/lint/warning/axiom-clean; design §(4.33)).** The §(4.32)
  corner index map was GARBLED: corner pin is `v = (ends e_b).1` not `a`, so `en := columnSplit v`, and
  the `0` block needs a FIXED-pin op, not the per-row-keyed `..._apply_eq_zero_of_ne`. Landed sorry-free:
  `rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_apply_pin_zero` (FIXED-pin `0` block, via `columnOp_apply_single`),
  `..._apply_corner` (the `hA` corner = panel functional on `v`'s cols, via `hingeRow_comp_columnOp_apply`),
  `..._reindex_toBlocks₂₁_eq_zero` (the (4b) `toBlocks₂₁=0` reduction). DEEPER FINDING: the cert's
  total-`em`-bijection `fromBlocks A B 0 D` is UNSATISFIABLE for `D ≥ 3` (the `D−2` surplus `v`-rows
  break both `toBlocks₂₁=0` and `hD`); KT's (6.64) is a SUBSPACE statement. `hD`/`hA` are NOT the
  blocker (~1-leaf gate facts, no hard relabel — this is the single-split form). FLAG: options
  (4b′ row-submatrix reshape, RECOMMENDED) / (4a relabel, hard) / (C fallback); no phase-direction
  picked. NEXT = (4b′). No new friction (standard: a `BodyHingeFramework.foo` decl auto-opens its
  namespace for the body, so a `_root_`-level helper must qualify `BodyHingeFramework.columnOp`).
- **A6 EDGE-restricted operated-entry facts LANDED — `rigidityMatrixEdge_mul_columnOp_row` /
  `..._apply` / `..._apply_eq_zero_of_ne` (2026-06-25, `Concrete.lean`,
  full-build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).** The (6.61) operated-entry facts, re-stated on the
  EDGE-restricted matrix `rigidityMatrixEdge` (the cert's actual row index `{e // e ∈ E(G)} ×
  Fin (D−1)`) with edge-restricted `hgp`. Verbatim structural mirrors of the all-`β`
  `rigidityMatrixProd_mul_columnOp_*` facts (both matrices are
  `Matrix.of (dualProductCoordEquiv ∘ rigidityRowFun·)`; the edge functional has the same body
  support, so the off-`v` `0` block reads off identically). Closes the §(4.32) "operated-entry facts
  carry over verbatim" gap: they were stated on `rigidityMatrixProd` (total `hgp`, unsatisfiable on
  the real arm), so A6's `hblock` block-fill now reads its `0` block directly on the cert's row index.
  Shrunk to fit one sitting (`hblock`'s `fromBlocks` ASSEMBLY is the MED–HIGH crux; this banks its
  three entrywise inputs SORRY-FREE). No new friction (the `.row`-align idiom is already filed). NEXT
  = the `hblock` `fromBlocks` assembly + the arm re-route.
- **ROUTE-A CERT LANDED — `case_III_rank_certification_matrix` (2026-06-25, `CaseIII/Candidate.lean`,
  full-build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).** The abstract block-data drop-in for
  `case_III_rank_certification_chain`: takes the candidate framework + edge-restricted `hgp`/`hends`
  (over `G.edgeSet`; `F₀.graph = G` is `rfl`) + the (6.61)→(6.64) block data + cardinalities + count
  facts, fires the landed composition core, produces the byte-identical-to-`_chain` honest target.
  Block data + cardinalities enter as `h…` hypotheses (the geometry is A6's burden) — parallels how
  `_chain` consumed `(W, g, …)`. New import edge `Candidate.lean → RigidityMatrix.Concrete` (acyclic;
  full build green). Friction: `[Fintype α] [DecidableEq α]` needed in the signature (not `[Finite α]`)
  for the `Matrix.mul`/`reindex` over `α × Fin D` — recurrence of TACTICS-QUIRKS §64 (signature
  elaborates first), no new entry. NEXT = A6 (build `hblock` from the geometry + wire the arm).
- **`em` panel-row split LANDED — `edgeRowSplit` + `edgeRowSplit_corner_card` (2026-06-25,
  `Concrete.lean`, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).** The structural row analog of `columnSplit`: the
  designated-edge `ea` corner/rest partition of the EDGE-restricted row index `{e // e ∈ E(G)} ×
  Fin (D−1)` (same `Equiv.sumCompl (· = ea)`/`prodCongr`/`sumProdDistrib` build), `ea`-corner card
  `= screwDim k − 1` (the `(D−1)` panel rows of `e_a`). The panel-row half of the composition-core's
  `em` input — the full corner `m₁` adds the one reproduced `e_b` `±r` row (eq. (6.66), card
  `D = (D−1)+1`) at the `hblock` assembly. With `en`/`U`/`hU` already landed, three of the four named
  A5c inputs are in hand. Shrunk to fit one sitting (`case_III_rank_certification_matrix` is the
  MED–HIGH crux; this banks one complete reusable carrier-agnostic input SORRY-FREE). No new friction
  (exact mirror of `columnSplit`). NEXT = the `+1`-row `em` assembly + `hblock`.
- **`en` column split LANDED — `columnSplit` + `columnSplit_corner_card` (2026-06-24, `Concrete.lean`,
  build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).** The body-`a` corner/bottom partition of the product column index
  `α × Fin D` (PROBE 3): `columnSplit a : α × Fin D ≃ ({body // body = a} × Fin D) ⊕ ({body // body ≠
  a} × Fin D)` (`Equiv.sumCompl (· = a)` distributed over `Fin D` via `Equiv.prodCongr` +
  `Equiv.sumProdDistrib`), with the corner card `= screwDim k` (`Fintype.card_prod` +
  `Fintype.card_subtype_eq` + `screwSpace_finrank`). This is the `en` input the composition core
  consumes; with the already-landed `U`/`hU` (`prodColumnOpEquiv (columnOp hva).symm` +
  `..._transpose_toMatrix'_det_isUnit`), two of the three named A5c inputs are now in hand. Shrunk to
  fit one sitting (per the one-sitting scope rule) — the full `case_III_rank_certification_matrix` is
  MED–HIGH/2–3 leaves; this banks one complete, reusable, carrier-agnostic input SORRY-FREE. NEXT =
  the `em` row split + `hblock`. Friction: a computable `Equiv.sumCompl (· = a)`-based def needs a
  `[DecidableEq α]` *hypothesis*, not an in-body `Classical` (→ FRICTION [idiom]).
- **A5c composition core LANDED — `finrank_span_rigidityRows_ge_of_edge_fromBlocks` (2026-06-24,
  `Concrete.lean`, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).** The PROBE-2 body packaged as a standalone
  carrier-agnostic lemma (`[Fintype α] [DecidableEq α] [Finite β]`): edge-restricted `hgp`/`hends` +
  unit-det `U` + `em`/`en` with `(rigidityMatrixEdge * U).reindex em en = fromBlocks A B 0 D` (LI
  corner/bottom rows) ⟹ `#m₁ + #m₂ ≤ finrank (span F.rigidityRows)`. Two-line proof: the A4 bridge
  `Matrix.rank_ge_of_isUnit_mul_reindex_fromBlocks` + the A4.5e honest-rank bridge. Shrunk the named
  A5c deliverable to fit one sitting (per the one-sitting scope rule) — this lands the composition
  half SORRY-FREE; the remaining A5c work is the chain-data-geometry inputs (`U`/`em`/`en`/`hblock`/LI)
  that feed it. One build-config friction: had to add a `public import` of the project
  `Mathlib.LinearAlgebra.Matrix.Rank` mirror to `Concrete.lean` — the A4 specialization
  `rigidityMatrix_mul_rank` used only the *mathlib* `rank_mul_eq_left_of_isUnit_det`, so the project
  bridge `rank_ge_of_isUnit_mul_reindex_fromBlocks` was not transitively imported until now (phase-local;
  the next A5c leaf builds in the same file). NO `ScrewSpace` unfolding. NEXT = the A5c `hblock` residual.
- **A4.5e LANDED — the edge-restricted matrix `rigidityMatrixEdge` (2026-06-24, `Concrete.lean`,
  build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).** Six decls (`blockBasisOn`, `rigidityRowFunEdge`,
  `rigidityMatrixEdge : Matrix ({e // e ∈ E(G)} × Fin (D−1)) (α × Fin D) ℝ`, `rigidityMatrixEdge_rank`,
  `span_range_rigidityRowFunEdge`, `rigidityMatrixEdge_rank_eq_finrank_span_rigidityRows`) — the
  product matrix re-indexed by edges only, with `hgp`/`hends` quantified `∀ e ∈ E(G), …` (the
  satisfiable real-arm form: the all-`β` `rigidityMatrixProd` honest-rank bridges need them total over
  `β`, unfireable once `β` has non-edges). Rank bridge = a one-line `Matrix.rank_of_coordEquiv` on the
  `Subtype` row index (the carrier-agnostic lemma's `[Finite ι]` row index takes the subtype-product
  for free; no `ScrewSpace` unfold); the span identity is the `span_range_rigidityRowFun` argument
  restricted to edges (`≥` uses `IsLink.edge_mem` for the link's edge-membership). Came in under the
  ~1–1.5-leaf estimate — both bridges are mechanical re-statements of the landed all-`β` versions.
  NEXT = A5c. One friction: `E(G)` scoped notation isn't in scope here (`Concrete.lean` has no
  `open Graph`) → wrote `F.graph.edgeSet` (TACTICS-QUIRKS § 67).
- **A5c+A6 INTEGRATION SPIKE — re-pointed the next leaf to A4.5e (docs-only, 2026-06-24, design
  §I.8.24(4.32); A4.5e now landed).** Verdict: the A6 composition skeleton is SORRY-FREE on the actual
  `caseIIICandidate` arm, but the §(4.31) decomposition was off by one leaf — the all-`β`-row
  `rigidityMatrix(Prod)` honest-rank bridges need `hgp`/`hends` total over `β`, unsatisfiable with
  non-edges. Fix = A4.5e (edge-restricted matrix, now landed above). Bankable PROBE 1/2/3/5/6 fragments
  + the A5c/A6 corrected signatures: design §I.8.24(4.32).
- **A5c operated-entry facts LANDED — the entrywise facts for `rigidityMatrixProd * U` (2026-06-24,
  `Concrete.lean`, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).** Two decls: `rigidityMatrixProd_mul_columnOp_apply`
  (the operated entry formula `(M*U) p (body,c) = rigidityRowFun p (Φ.symm (Pi.single body …))` for ANY
  `Φ`; composes the A5a `_row` identity + the keystone + `LinearEquiv.dualMap_apply`) and
  `rigidityMatrixProd_mul_columnOp_apply_eq_zero_of_ne` (the operated (6.61) zero block, `Φ =
  (columnOp hva).symm` so the precomposition is `columnOp hva` — `hingeRow_comp_columnOp_apply`
  collapses the operated wrap row to a *pure `v`-column* row, KT (6.14)–(6.16), `0` off `v`). The
  earlier keystone facts (`dualProductCoordEquiv_apply`, `..._apply_eq_zero_of_ne`) were for the
  *un-operated* matrix; the `hblock` block-fill reads the *operated* `M*U`, which these supply directly.
  One small friction: `congrFun … (body,c)` of the `_row` identity needs `rw [Matrix.row] at h` to align
  `.row p (body,c)` with the goal's bare `p (body,c)` (FRICTION sibling of the A5a `.row` idiom). NEXT =
  the A5c-assembly residue (the `em`/`en` split + `fromBlocks` reindex), which folds toward A6.
- **A5c-keystone LANDED — the entrywise facts the `hblock` block-fill reads (2026-06-24,
  `Concrete.lean`, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).** Two decls + the owed doc-fix:
  `dualProductCoordEquiv_apply` (the PROBE-5 keystone `dualProductCoordEquiv φ (body, j) =
  φ (Pi.single body (finScrewBasis k j))`; pure `Basis.dualBasis_equivFun` + `Pi.basis_apply`) and
  `BodyHingeFramework.rigidityMatrixProd_apply_eq_zero_of_ne` (the (6.61) lower-left **zero block
  entrywise-visible** — the entry vanishes off the edge's endpoints, `r (0 − 0) = 0`, NO span argument,
  NO `ScrewSpace` unfold). The keystone forced `simp only` not `rw` (the def froze a `Classical.decEq`
  on its `Σ`-index → instance-defeq mismatch with ambient `[DecidableEq α]`; new TACTICS-QUIRKS § 66 +
  FRICTION). Came in under the ~1.5–2.5-leaf A5c estimate because it is just the entrywise *content*;
  the `em`/`en` split + `fromBlocks` reindex (the A5c-assembly) needs the chain-data geometry and folds
  toward A6. NEXT = A5c-assembly.
- **A5b LANDED — the gate re-wrap (`LinearIndependent (·.row)` for the A3/A4 `hA`/`hD`) (2026-06-24,
  `Concrete.lean`, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).** Two decls: `Matrix.linearIndependent_row_of_coordEquiv`
  (carrier-agnostic: for ANY `coordEquiv : Dual ℝ M ≃ₗ (κ → ℝ)`,
  `LinearIndependent ℝ (Matrix.of (coordEquiv ∘ w)).row ↔ LinearIndependent ℝ w`; one-liner
  `LinearMap.linearIndependent_iff coordEquiv coordEquiv.ker`, the LI sibling of
  `Matrix.rank_of_coordEquiv`) + `BodyHingeFramework.linearIndependent_rigidityMatrixProd_row_iff` (the
  `coordEquiv := dualProductCoordEquiv` instance). No `ScrewSpace` unfolding (the re-wrap stays at the
  `LinearEquiv` boundary, kernel `⊥`). Came in well under the ~1–2-leaf estimate — the iff is the whole
  content; the corner-block full-rank *content* (`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_edge` +
  `omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent`) is consumed *by A5c* via this iff, not re-derived here. NEXT = A5c.
- **A5a LANDED — the (6.61) column-op-as-right-multiply on the product matrix (2026-06-24,
  `Concrete.lean`, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).** Three decls: `prodColumnOpEquiv Φ` (the
  coordinatized column-op equiv = `Φ.symm.dualMap` conjugated by `dualProductCoordEquiv`),
  `prodColumnOpEquiv_transpose_toMatrix'_det_isUnit` (`IsUnit ((toMatrix' (prodColumnOpEquiv Φ))ᵀ).det`,
  the A4/A3 unit-det right-multiply input), and `rigidityMatrixProd_mul_columnOp_row` (the row identity:
  `· * U` precomposes each rigidity-row functional with `Φ`). Generic in `Φ` — KT's `columnOp` is one
  such, so A5a never references `columnOp`. All carrier-agnostic (no `ScrewSpace` unfold); the
  span-membership wall never forms. PROBE-2c/4 fragments landed verbatim. NEXT = A5b (gate re-wrap).
- **A4.5 LANDED — the product-column rigidity matrix + the generalized rank bridge (2026-06-24,
  `Concrete.lean`, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).** Generalized `Matrix.rank_of_dualCoord` →
  `Matrix.rank_of_coordEquiv` (any coordinatizing `Dual ℝ M ≃ₗ (κ → ℝ)`); the old name is its flat
  instance, and `rigidityMatrix_rank` + the capstone stay green (no orphan/dup — coordinator's refactor).
  Added `finScrewBasis` / `dualProductCoordEquiv` / `BodyHingeFramework.rigidityMatrixProd : Matrix
  (β × Fin (D−1)) (α × Fin D) ℝ` + its honest-rank bridges `rigidityMatrixProd_rank`(`_eq_finrank_span
  _rigidityRows`), all one-line instances of the generalized lemma + the shared `span_range_rigidityRowFun`.
  The `screwBasis` name was taken (powerset-indexed, `PanelLayer.lean`) → renamed `finScrewBasis`
  (FRICTION + TACTICS-QUIRKS §65: single-file build hides the clash, `lake lint` catches it). NEXT = A5a.
- **A5 ROUTE-COMPOSITION SPIKE (2026-06-24, design §I.8.24(4.31)).** Verdict (now LANDED as A4.5): the flat
  `rigidityMatrix`'s arbitrary `finBasis` columns don't factor `α × Fin D`, so `hblock`'s `D×D` split needs
  the product matrix; the (6.61) column op IS a unit-det right-multiply over a coordinatized matrix (route
  A's escape holds, never a span membership). 5 probes SORRY-FREE. Exact A5/A6 signatures → design §(4.31).
- **A4 LANDED — the (6.61) column-op bridge into A3 (2026-06-24, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).**
  Two composing lemmas: `Matrix.rank_ge_of_isUnit_mul_reindex_fromBlocks` (`Rank.lean`,
  carrier-agnostic — `hblock : (M*U).reindex em en = fromBlocks A B 0 D` + LI diagonal rows ⟹
  `#m₁+#m₂ ≤ M.rank`, one `calc`: A3 ⟹ `rank_reindex` ⟹ `rank_mul_eq_left_of_isUnit_det`) +
  `BodyHingeFramework.rigidityMatrix_mul_rank` (`Concrete.lean`, the rigidity specialization of the
  column op). This is KT's "(6.61) submatrix containment, not difficult to see" realized as a
  *unit-det right-multiply* (rank-invariant), NEVER a span membership — why route A escapes the wall.
  Scope finding: the rank-invariance/bridge *plumbing* is A4; the entrywise *construction* of the
  specific `U` + its `fromBlocks` reindexing needs the chain-data geometry, so it folds into A5 (which
  supplies `hblock`'s blocks). § 64 (Fintype-in-signature) recurred but is fully covered — `m₁/m₂`
  appear in the goal's `Fintype.card`, so `[Fintype]`; `p/n₁/n₂` only in hyps, so `[Finite]`+`ofFinite`.
- **A3 LANDED — the (6.64) block-additivity kernel as a pure-`Matrix` inequality (2026-06-24,
  `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean`, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).**
  `Matrix.rank_fromBlocks_zero₂₁_ge_of_linearIndependent_rows`: `fromBlocks A B 0 D` with `A`,`D` rows
  each LI ⟹ `#m₁+#m₂ ≤ rank`. Stated in the LI-rows form the realization arm supplies (full-rank `D×D`
  corner + full-row-rank IH bottom-block) — so the general-rank → LI-rows row-subset extraction is
  *unneeded*, and the lemma collapses to: combined `(m₁⊕m₂)`-square minor is block-triangular ⟹
  `det = det·det ≠ 0` (`det_fromBlocks_zero₂₁`) ⟹ LI rows ⟹ `rank = #m₁+#m₂`, then `rank_submatrix_le`.
  Came in at ~1 clean leaf (vs §(4.30)'s 2–3 estimate). It is route A's analog of
  `finrank_add_card_le_of_linearIndependent_mkQ` but forms **no span membership** — why route A
  dissolves the §(4.18)–(4.30) wall (a literal block-matrix fact, not a dual-space containment).
- **A1+A2 de-risk LANDED — opacity CLEAN (2026-06-24, `Concrete.lean`, build/lint/warning/axiom-clean).**
  A1 (`rigidityMatrix` + `rigidityMatrix_row`) + A2 (`Matrix.rank_of_dualCoord` carrier-agnostic,
  `rigidityMatrix_rank`, the clause-(iii) capstone `rigidityMatrix_rank_eq_finrank_span_rigidityRows` on
  the honest `finrank (span rigidityRows)`, `span_range_rigidityRowFun`). The §(4.30) residual RESOLVED:
  the bridge runs through `Basis`/`LinearEquiv`, never unfolding opaque `ScrewSpace`;
  `Matrix.rank_eq_finrank_span_row` fires zero-detour. Sharpened cost ≈7–11 (A4 the column-op now the
  outlier). Lesson (the carrier-agnostic A2 bridge is WHY opacity is a non-issue) → Findings.
- **Route A CHOSEN by the user (2026-06-24), with cost data.** After the genuine-row base-block family
  closed (4 walls, §(4.18)–(4.29)) and route A was scoped FEASIBLE-but-HEAVY (§(4.30), ~9–14-leaf
  sub-phase), the user chose route A (the honest unconditional `Matrix`-model Thm 5.5) over the cheap
  honest-conditional (C). Execution: A1+A2 `d=3` de-risk landed (above); next A3; open route A as its own
  sub-phase. (C) demoted to documented fallback. Lesson (the 4-wall saga + the verify-first wins) →
  Findings.
- **Route A SCOPED — FEASIBLE but HEAVY, genuinely ≠ the refuted §(4.22)/(4.23) work (§(4.30)).** §(4.22)/
  (4.23) refuted option (i) (abstract span-block-rank — landed as
  `finrank_add_card_le_of_linearIndependent_mkQ`, the chain cert's kernel, walling on span MEMBERSHIP);
  route A is option (ii) (a literal mathlib `Matrix R(G,p)`) where KT's (6.61) submatrix-containment is an
  entrywise column-op equality (`Matrix.rank_mul_eq_right_of_isUnit_det`, mathlib-confirmed), never a
  membership — so it dissolves the wall. COST ≈9–14 leaves (A3/A4 genuinely-new; no existing `Matrix`
  rigidity infra). A-vs-(C) is a COST call. The A1/A2 opacity constant-factor was the one unsettled item
  (now resolved by the de-risk).
- **The genuine-row base-block family is CLOSED — the wall is intrinsic to the `caseIIICandidate`
  slot-override, 4 wall appearances (§(4.18)–(4.29)).** Route B's interior `hS` (§(4.26)), route 4-bare's
  `hseedrank` (§(4.28)), route 4-splitOff's `hWS` (§(4.29)) all wall: the wrap edge `edge i` content
  cannot enter the corner-overridden candidate span — the discriminator gate `ρ₀ ⊥̸ C(vᵢ₊₁, n')` is
  invariant under base-block re-targeting (the load-bearing finding; "Q1-clean/Q2-walls" the diagnostic —
  the relabel/rank machinery generalizes, the block is one layer up at the override). The route-B/4
  leaves stay in tree sound-in-isolation; `exists_seed_base_block` (057a86e) is a dead conditional
  (unsatisfiable `hseedrank` for the bare seed, harmless, no caller). Full kernel traces: design
  §(4.18)–(4.29). Lesson → Findings.
- **Opened 2026-06-24 at a clean-break close of 23c (user-adjudicated), at the member-mapping-wall STOP.**
  23c's option (A) `±r`-block engine is refuted at the rank-cert level (the redundancy-carry half
  succeeded — interior `hρe₀` closed). 23d = the rank-cert reconsideration, within the CHAIN layer
  (CHAIN spans 23b+23c+23d). Structural precedent: the 23b→23c clean-break close at this same wall.

### Promoted to TACTICS-QUIRKS / Findings (model-experiment.md) / DESIGN.md
- *A lemma whose goal exposes `Matrix.rank`/`mulVec` on a constructed column type (`m⊕n`, Pi, …) needs
  `[Fintype]` on that type in the signature — `[Finite]` + in-proof `Fintype.ofFinite` is too late (the
  signature elaborates first)* → TACTICS-QUIRKS § 64 (hit authoring A3).
- *`(M * Uᵀ).row p c` does not `rw` via `Matrix.mul_apply'` but IS defeq to `Matrix.vecMul (M.row p) Uᵀ c`
  — open with `change … = _`, then `Matrix.vecMul_transpose` + `LinearMap.toMatrix'_mulVec`* →
  FRICTION [idiom] (hit authoring A5a's row identity).
- *`rw [defName, …apiLemma]` fails *"synthesized instance not defeq … instDecidableEqSigma / Classical.decEq"*
  when the def froze a `Classical.decEq` in its body — use `simp only` (lenient on instances) or `congr 1`+`rw`*
  → TACTICS-QUIRKS § 66 + FRICTION [idiom] (hit authoring the A5c-keystone `dualProductCoordEquiv_apply`).
- *`E(G)`/`V(G)` scoped Graph notation is not in scope in `Molecular/RigidityMatrix/` files (no
  `open Graph`) — write the `F.graph.edgeSet` dot form in signatures; `lean_multi_attempt` masks it*
  → TACTICS-QUIRKS § 67 + FRICTION [idiom] (hit authoring A4.5e's edge-restricted binders).
- *A computable `Equiv` built from `Equiv.sumCompl (· = a)` needs a `[DecidableEq α]` hypothesis on
  the def, not an in-body `Classical` (else it fails to compile as `noncomputable`)* → FRICTION
  [idiom] (hit authoring the A5c `columnSplit`).
- *The deferred-hypothesis-unsat trap recurs at composition; a wall recurring across structurally-different
  fixes is intrinsic to a shared downstream object* → model-experiment Findings (rows 449–455) + DESIGN.md
  *Constructibility recon*. The full per-route kernel traces (§(4.18)–(4.30)) live in `Phase23-design.md`.
