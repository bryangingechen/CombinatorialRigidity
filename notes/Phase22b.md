# Phase 22b — KT Claim 6.4 (Case-I green-modulo discharge) (work log)

**Status:** in progress — **discharging `htransport`; U1 + U2 + ALL of U3b LANDED (sound); route (i)
(motive strengthening) Commit 1 of 5 LANDED — next is Commit 2 (the `linkRecording` bridge, design
doc §1.24)** (opened 2026-06-05 as the coordinator's Close-C of Phase
22a; opening recon + the reduction N-22b-1/2/3 landed 2026-06-05; the T2b math-first re-recon landed
2026-06-05; U2 opened + reconciliation core landed 2026-06-05; U1 + the U2 per-edge tail landed
2026-06-05 as `9098129`; the U3b build-recon corrected 2026-06-05 (design doc §1.22); the U3b
pin-count sub-lemma (the §1.22 walling node) landed 2026-06-05 as `0f0e7aa`; the U3b `Z ⊔ W = ⊤`
dual-annihilator assembly landed 2026-06-05 as `6b004b8`; the U3b projected-subfamily extraction
landed 2026-06-05 as `8bafe8d`; the U3a build-recon (the alignment is NOT a leaf, design doc §1.23)
landed 2026-06-05 as `95514b7`; route (i) scope-verification (§1.24) landed 2026-06-05 as `c880b9f`;
**route-(i) Commit 1 (edge-restrict `hasGenericRealization_transport_ends`'s `hne_ends` + the
`endsOf_fst_ne_snd` distinctness fact) landed 2026-06-05, this commit**). The phase does *not* close
until `htransport` is discharged: `lem:claim-6-4` stays red green-modulo it.

**Route (i) scope-verified — the motive strengthening is buildable (design doc §1.24, this commit,
docs-only).** The user decided route (i) (§1.23: add "the realization's `ends` records its own
graph's links" to the motive, then discharge the `hbundle` alignment conjuncts and build U3a/U4).
The §1.24 recon traced this against the live code and **confirms the proposed scope** (no
contradiction): (1) the strengthening is **generic-motive only** — `ends`-transport lives entirely in
the generic Case-I flow (the swap brick + `hasGenericRealization_transport_ends` have one call site
each, both in `case_I_realization`; the bare-motive couplings take leg rigidity pre-aligned at the
parent selector and never transport), so the bare `HasFullRankRealization` + `theorem_55` stay
untouched; (2) **every** generic producer (`CaseI:170/520/568/667`, `GenericityDevice:869`, the
block-triangular `CaseI:1388`) constructs **fresh** `ofNormals G ends q₀` and takes a link-recording
`hends` as a parameter, so each gets the new conjunct for free from the canonical `endsOf`; (3) the
three risk items hold, two sharpening in our favour — (a) `hne_ends` is unsatisfiable for `endsOf`
(junk `(default,default)` on non-edges, `Operations.lean:81`) so it must be edge-restricted then
discharged from `endsOf`-on-links distinctness via `G.Simple`; (b) the `hswap`-discharge bridge
`endsOf_eq_or_swap` (`Operations.lean:102`) is **already landed**; (c) the contraction-leg
`IsLink.map`-under-`collapseTo` is one small derived lemma off mathlib `Graph.map_isLink` (since
`rigidContract = (G ＼ E(H)).map (collapseTo r V(H))`, `ReducibleVertex:680`), not a wall. This commit
is **docs-only** (no Lean / `\leanok` / blueprint): it records the verified scope + the 5-commit
sequence so the next session opens on Commit 1 (a provable-now brick).

**U3a build-recon — the §1.20 "alignment RESOLVED in principle" is NOT a buildable leaf (design doc
§1.23, this commit, docs-only).** Tracing U3a against the live structure defs found the alignment
transport rests on an assumption the IH motive does NOT provide: `HasGenericFullRankRealization k G`
witnesses carry a **free** endpoint selector `ends` with no link-recording invariant, and the motion
space depends on `ends` (the hinge constraint reads `supportExtensor e = panelSupportExtensor (normal
(ends e))`). So `Q`'s rigidity (at `Q.ends`) does *not* transport to the `endsᵐ`-selector framework
via `infinitesimalMotions_…_ends_swap` unless `Q.ends` records `Q.graph`'s links and aligns with the
parent selector — which rigidity alone does not force. **The identical gap is already an *undischarged*
`hbundle` conjunct** — the `H`-leg `hswap` (`case_I_realization`'s first `hbundle` conjunct, consumed
at the `hasGenericRealization_transport_ends H …` call, never proven). So U3a is one of *two* faces of
a single missing motive guarantee, not "the last research-shaped brick." The honest fix is a
**motive strengthening** (add "the realization's `ends` records its graph's links" to the motive) — a
Phase-21/22-touching structural edit re-typing every producer's conclusion, comparable to the §1.3/§1.4
two-motive split, not a leaf commit. This commit is **docs-only** (no Lean / `\leanok` / blueprint
edits): it corrects the build target before building, the §1.20/§1.22 course-correction pattern, so
the next session opens on the motive recon rather than a mis-scoped transport build. U3b stays green
(its bricks take a framework rigid at an external link-recording selector — that hypothesis is exactly
what is now seen to need manufacturing).

**Course-correction (2026-06-05; design doc §1.20).** The U2-opening session **forked under
backgrounding**: its (lost) pre-reset analysis found that §1.19's "walling node retired at U2 / U3
is plumbing" is **wrong** — the research-shaped crux did not vanish, it *moved from U2 to U3*. The
post-reset (context-wiped) instance committed the sound U1 + U2 Lean (`9098129`) but wrote an
over-optimistic hand-off; that commit keeps the Lean and corrects the notes. U2 (the collapse-relabel
*row reconciliation* `panelRow_collapseTo_comp_extProj_dualMap` + `hingeRow_collapseTo_comp_extProj_eq`
+ U1 `degeneratePlacement`, KT's `p2`) **is** genuinely done. But the actual content of **KT Claim
6.4** — that the exterior-column projection `(extProj V(H)).dualMap` (which drops exactly the
`r`-column) *preserves* independent rank `D(|sc|−1)` — is a **pin-a-body** fact that needs a new,
**missing** linear-algebra brick, and it sits in **U3** (split into U3a alignment + U3b the crux).
See §1.20 for the full O1/O2 analysis and the corrected cut.

**Second course-correction (2026-06-05; design doc §1.22, this commit).** The U3b build-recon
(traced against the live finrank machinery + the mathlib dual API) found §1.21's "U3b is a bounded
one-line Lemma 5.1 corollary" was itself **wrong**: §1.21 assumed `Qcf'` rigid ⟹ `finrank(Z) = D`,
but `Qcf'` is rigid on its *vertex set* `sc ⊊ α`, so `finrank(Z) = D(|scᶜ|+1)` and
`finrank(pinnedMotions r) = D·|scᶜ| ≠ 0`. The clean `D(|sc|−1)` projected rank survives via an
**exact free-isolated-body cancellation**, not a zero-rank-loss pin. §1.22 re-derives the
verified-closing layer: the brick reduces to `Z ⊔ range(extProj V(H)) = ⊤` (via the mathlib dual
API), whose one real-content fact is the rigid-block pin-count
`finrank(F.pinnedMotionsOn V(H)) = D(|scᶜ| − |V(H)| + 1)`. This is a docs-only re-recon (no Lean this
commit): it corrects the build target before building, exactly the §1.20 pattern, so the U3b build
opens on the right walling node (the pin-count sub-lemma) rather than a mis-stated one.

The U3b math-first recon is **done and corrected** (design doc §1.21 → **§1.22**, this commit):
§1.21's "bounded one-line Lemma 5.1 corollary" was **wrong** — it assumed `finrank(Z) = D`, but
`Qcf'` is rigid on its *vertex set* `sc` (a proper subset of `α`), so `finrank(Z) = D(|scᶜ|+1)` and
`finrank(pinnedMotions r) = D·|scᶜ| ≠ 0`. The clean `D(|sc|−1)` projected rank survives via an
**exact free-isolated-body cancellation**. The corrected layer (§1.22, verified-closing against the
live finrank machinery + the mathlib dual API): the brick reduces to `Φ ⊓ ker D = ⊥` ⟺
`Z ⊔ range(extProj V(H)) = ⊤`, whose **one real-content fact** is the rigid-block pin-count
`finrank(F.pinnedMotionsOn V(H)) = D(|scᶜ| − |V(H)| + 1)` (a small product-space iso peeling the
free isolated columns). All mathlib + green project facts are confirmed present. The next concrete
commit is the **U3b build, opening on that pin-count sub-lemma** (the walling node); then the
`Z ⊔ W = ⊤` assembly + the projected-subfamily extraction, then U3a (alignment) → U4 (assemble +
flip). The *Discharge plan* checklist (U3b item) + design doc §1.20/§1.21/§1.22 carry the design.

Stratum 5 of the molecular-conjecture program, continued. **Scope: just KT
Claim 6.4** — the single deferred obligation Phase 22a left green-modulo. 22a's
Case-I realization composer `PanelHingeFramework.case_I_realization`
(`AlgebraicInduction/CaseI.lean`) / blueprint `lem:case-I-realization` is green-modulo
one dischargeable hypothesis, `hclaim64`, tracked by the red blueprint node
`lem:claim-6-4`. 22b's target is to **discharge it** — flipping `lem:claim-6-4`
green and `lem:case-I-realization` to fully green.

This is the same green-modulo → discharge pattern as Phase 21 → 21b. The KT math
is **worked out** in `notes/Phase22-realization-design.md` §1.13–§1.16 and
`notes/Phase22a.md` *Hand-off* / *Blockers*; 22b **formalizes** it, it does not
re-derive it. Forward-mode / structural-edit (`blueprint/CLAUDE.md`): 22b opens no
new chapter — `lem:claim-6-4` is the existing red node in `algebraic-induction.tex`;
Lean lands in `Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/CaseI.lean`.

## Current state

22b discharges **KT Claim 6.4** (`lem:claim-6-4`) down to its single irreducible
analytic core. **All three planned nodes N-22b-1/2/3 are landed.** N-22b-2 (bounded
packaging, `exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn_linking_set_proj`) and N-22b-1 (the
research-shaped rank-transport `rigidContract_exterior_rank_transport`, carrying the
irreducible algebraic-independence content as the explicit hypothesis `htransport`)
landed first; **N-22b-3 (the wire-up) is now landed** — the composer
`PanelHingeFramework.case_I_realization`'s third `hbundle` conjunct was reshaped from the
fully-packaged `hclaim64` (`∃ Qc …`) to the narrower `htransport` single-placement witness
(matching N-22b-1), and the `Qc`-non-root packaging the block-triangular coupling consumes
is now **reconstructed in-proof** by composing N-22b-1 (`rigidContract_exterior_rank_transport`,
witness `q₀`/`t`) → N-22b-2 (`exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn_linking_set_proj`, packaging).
The graph-arg mismatch (`ofNormals G` in the coupling vs. `ofNormals (G.deleteEdges E(H))`
in N-22b-2) closes by defeq — `panelRow` for `ofNormals` consults only `normal`/`ends`/
`supportExtensor`, all graph-independent — so the final `exact` unifies them with no glue.
Axiom-clean (`propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`), build + lint warning-clean.

**State of 22b: reduction landed (green-modulo `htransport`); U1 + U2 + ALL of U3b landed (sound);
route (i) decided + scope-verified; Commit 1 of 5 landed (edge-restrict + `endsOf_fst_ne_snd`),
paused before Commit 2, NOT closed.** The honesty gate
(`blueprint/CLAUDE.md` *Every hypothesis of a `\leanok` node is discharged*) forbids `\leanok` on
`lem:claim-6-4` while `htransport` is an undischarged load-bearing hypothesis. So `lem:claim-6-4`
gets its `\lean{}` pins (the two bricks) but **stays red**; `lem:case-I-realization` stays
legitimately green via the case-(b) green-modulo pattern (its load-bearing hypothesis IS the
conclusion of the `\uses`'d `lem:claim-6-4`). The remaining work is discharging `htransport`. The
discharge cut evolved: §1.18 validated `htransport` as tractable + stays-22b; §1.19's 4-node cut
(U1→U2→U3→U4) had U1/U2 land sound; §1.20 course-corrected (the Claim-6.4 crux moved U2→U3, split
into U3a alignment + U3b projected-rank); **all of U3b is now landed** (the genuine KT Claim 6.4
crux — §1.22's pin-count + `Z ⊔ W = ⊤` assembly + projected-subfamily extraction). §1.23 then found
**U3a is not a leaf** — the IH motive `HasGenericFullRankRealization` carries a *free* `ends` with no
link-recording, so `Q`'s rigidity does not transport to the relabel selector; the same gap is the
undischarged `H`-leg `hswap` conjunct. **The user decided route (i)** (strengthen the motive); the
**§1.24 scope-verification recon** confirmed route (i) is buildable as a verified 5-commit
sequence (the *Discharge plan* below), generic-motive-only. **Commit 1 of 5 is now landed** (this
commit, Lean): the edge-restriction of `hasGenericRealization_transport_ends`'s `hne_ends` + the
`endsOf_fst_ne_snd` distinctness fact, closing risk (a). The next concrete commit is **Commit 2** (the
`linkRecording (ofNormals G G.endsOf q₀) G` bridge, provable now). Nothing is mid-stream.

### Opening recon — feasibility re-verification (this commit)

Confirmed against the live Lean before settling the cut:

- **Brick (b) has no wall (re-verified against the engine).** The bounded packaging
  variant feeds the engine `exists_polynomial_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_at`
  (`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean`), which is fully generic in its target
  space: it takes `g : (σ → ℝ) → ι → W` into *any* `[Module.Finite ℝ W]` space with a
  polynomial coordinatization `hg : φ (g p i) j = eval p (c i j)` and produces the
  `Qc ≠ 0` + `∀`-non-root LI packaging. The existing
  `exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn_linking_set`
  (`GenericityDevice.lean:1285`) instantiates it at `W = Module.Dual ℝ (α → ScrewSpace
  k)` with `g q i := panelRow ends i`. Brick (b) re-instantiates it at the
  **post-projection** family `g q i := (extProj sH).dualMap (panelRow ends i)` — a
  fixed linear map ∘ the rows, still polynomially coordinatized (`D` is `q`-independent
  and `D ∘ panelRow` is linear in the same panel coordinates), so the coordinatization
  `hg` survives as the `φ'`-pullback of `D ∘ g` for any basis `φ'` of the (finite-dim)
  codomain. **No new matrix-rank theory.** This is exactly the §1.16 "no wall" claim,
  now checked against the engine signature rather than asserted.
- **The composer's `hclaim64` shape is the discharge target verbatim.**
  `case_I_realization`'s `hbundle` third conjunct (CaseI.lean:1187–1198 after the N-22b-1
  insertion) is, for each
  `Q : PanelHingeFramework k α β` realizing `G.rigidContract H r` at its rank, exactly
  `∃ Qc ≠ 0, ∀ q, eval q Qc ≠ 0 → ∃ rsc, (links in G ＼ E(H)) ∧ |rsc| ≥ D(|sc|−1) ∧
  LinearIndependent ℝ (i ↦ (extProj V(H)).dualMap (panelRow ends i))`. N-22b-3 must
  produce *this* term from N-22b-1 (the witness placement) + N-22b-2 (the packaging).
  Both halves are present in the form the composer already consumes — the wire-up is
  a discharge of one existing hypothesis, not a re-statement.

## The target

**Claim 6.4 in the `Qc`-non-root / exterior-projected-rank form (the form
`case_I_realization` carries as `hclaim64`).** Verified dischargeable in design-doc
§1.16; the over-quantified `∀`-GP form was the 4th over-claim and is NOT the target.

Precisely (design doc §1.16, the form the block-triangular coupling
`hasGenericFullRankRealization_of_couple_blockTriangular_ofNormals_set` consumes):
given the contraction's generic IH, produce

> `∃ Qc ≠ 0, ∀ q, eval q Qc ≠ 0 → ∃ rsc, (links in Gc) ∧ |rsc| ≥ D(|sc|−1) ∧`
> `LinearIndependent (D ∘ panelRow rsc)`

where `Gc = G ＼ E(H)` is the surviving-edge block, `sc = (V(G)∖V(H)) ∪ {r}` the
surviving body set, and `D = (extProj V(H)).dualMap` the **exterior-column
projection** onto the surviving body columns `V(G)∖V(H)`. I.e. the surviving block
attains independent rank `≥ D(|sc|−1)` at a Zariski-**open (generic) locus** (a
contraction rank-polynomial `Qc`-non-root), restricted/projected to the surviving
columns.

**KT grounding** (verified 2026-06-05; `notes/Phase22a.md` *Hand-off*): this IS KT
**Claim 6.4 / eq. (6.9)** — `D` is the restriction to `V∖V′ = V(G)∖V(H)` columns,
and Claim 6.4 gives the surviving block's `V∖V′`-restricted rank `= D(|sc|−1)` (full
exterior column rank) at the generic placement. KT §5.1 (p. 668) bundles
non-degeneracy + rank-maximality under the single "coefficients algebraically
independent over ℚ" hypothesis (footnote 4 flags this as a deliberate
simplification); Claim 6.4 (p. 675, inside Lemma 6.3) reads the Case-I rank-transport
off it. Source eqs.: (6.5)/(6.9).

**Why irreducible** (G3a finding; design doc §1.7). The green linking-edge brick
does not apply — `collapseTo r V(H)` redirects each surviving edge's endpoints, so
its support extensor uses *different* panel normals in `rigidContract` vs. `G ＼ E(H)`,
breaking the `hspan` span-equality. The 21b genericity device does **not** discharge
it either (a distinct obligation: the collapse-normal mismatch).

## Discharge path (verified, design doc §1.16)

22b = **(a) research content + (b) bounded packaging**:

- **(a) the genuine research content** — the **rank-transport across the collapse
  map** from the contraction's generic IH via **algebraic independence** (KT §5.1 /
  eq. (6.9)): `∃` one placement with full exterior-projected surviving rank. This is
  the irreducible analytic step (the relabel-induced normal mismatch); it lands the
  *existence at a generic placement*.
- **(b) bounded packaging** — a **`D ∘ panelRow` variant** of the existing
  `exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn_linking_set` (which builds its polynomial via the
  generic mirror `exists_polynomial_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_at` from full-space
  rows `panelRow`). The variant feeds `D ∘ panelRow` (a fixed linear map ∘ the rows,
  still polynomially coordinatized) + a witness placement, producing the `Qc ≠ 0` +
  `∀`-non-root row-independence packaging the coupling consumes. No new matrix-rank
  theory; bounded — "no wall" per §1.16.

This form **avoids all four traps** documented for 22a (false `hpinc`; `∀`-GP-rigid;
`∀`-GP-independent; consumer/false-equality) and restores leg-symmetry (both legs via
rank-poly non-roots). The recon rule + the `∀`-GP-vs-generic-locus sharpening are in
`DESIGN.md` *Match the source's argument structure, not just its conclusion*.

## Lemma checklist

**Node cut settled in the opening recon** (math-first per `DESIGN.md`
*Constructibility recon …*). Three nodes, in build order. **N-22b-2 is the first
buildable commit** (bounded); N-22b-1 is research-shaped and may itself decompose;
N-22b-3 is the one-step wire-up + flip.

- [x] **N-22b-2 — `D ∘ panelRow` producer variant** (bounded; *first buildable*) —
  **LANDED.** `PanelHingeFramework.exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn_linking_set_proj`
  in `AlgebraicInduction/CaseI.lean` (sibling of the un-projected
  `exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn_linking_set` in `GenericityDevice.lean`). Takes the
  **already-witnessed subfamily `t`** with its support `hsupp`, count `hcount : m ≤
  Nat.card t`, and the **projected independence at `q₀`** `hindep` (the N-22b-1 output)
  as hypotheses, and produces
  `∃ Qc ≠ 0, ∀ q, eval q Qc ≠ 0 → ∃ rsc, (links) ∧ m ≤ Nat.card rsc ∧
  LinearIndependent ℝ (i ↦ (extProj t).dualMap (panelRow ends i))`. Passes `t`/`hsupp`/
  `hcount` through unchanged (the N7b-0 extraction is *upstream*, fed in, not re-derived
  here — cleaner factoring than the recon's proposed shape). Built by re-instantiating
  the engine `exists_polynomial_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_at` at the post-projection
  family `gD q i := D (panelRow ends i)`, `D = (extProj t).dualMap`; the coordinatization
  `hgD` is the parent's standard-basis pullback `hg` post-composed with `D`, where each
  projected coordinate is the matrix-pullback polynomial `cD i j := ∑ l, C (M j l) · c i l`
  via the matrix `M` of `φ ∘ D ∘ φ⁻¹`. **No new matrix-rank theory** (the engine is
  generic in its codomain). One supporting private helper
  `coord_linearMap_eq_matrix_mulVec` (the `φ (D w) j = ∑ l, M j l · φ w l` matrix-mulVec
  fact) is stated over an **abstract** finite-dim ℝ-space rather than the heavy
  `Module.Dual ℝ (α → ScrewSpace k)`, reusing the documented anti-`whnf` abstract-mirror
  lesson (FRICTION *`Basis.linearIndependent.map'` … blows up at `whnf`* → *General
  lesson*). Axiom-clean; build + lint warning-clean.
- [x] **N-22b-1 — rank-transport lemma** (research-shaped; the genuine analytic
  content) — **LANDED.** `PanelHingeFramework.rigidContract_exterior_rank_transport` in
  `AlgebraicInduction/CaseI.lean`. The algebraic-independence rank-transport across the
  collapse map: from the contraction `G.rigidContract H r`'s generic IH
  (`HasGenericFullRankRealization`), produce **one parent placement `q₀`** + a witnessed
  subfamily `t` of `G ＼ E(H)`-links at which the surviving block, exterior-projected onto
  the `V(G)∖V(H)` columns, attains independent rank `≥ D(|sc|−1)` (KT §5.1 / eqs.
  (6.5)/(6.9)) — i.e. exactly the `(q₀, t, hsupp, hcount, hindep)` tuple N-22b-2 consumes.
  The **math-first re-recon** (design doc §1.17) settled the layer: the collapse redirects
  surviving-edge normals, so the green linking-edge brick
  `infinitesimalMotions_eq_of_isLink_span_supportExtensor` does not apply (its `hspan`
  fails) and the Phase-21b genericity device addresses a distinct obligation (§1.7
  irreducibility, corroborated against the projected form). The irreducible
  algebraic-independence content is therefore carried as the explicit hypothesis
  `htransport` (Phase-21b green-modulo `h…` idiom; the faithful exterior-projected analogue
  of G3a's superseded motion-space `rigidContract_rigidity_transport`); the brick extracts
  the IH `⟨Q, hQg, hQgp, hQrig⟩` and forwards the witness — plumbing only. Axiom-clean
  (`propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`), no `sorry`; build + lint warning-clean.
  Discharging `htransport` itself is the *Discharge plan* (T1–T4) below — tractable, stays 22b
  (design doc §1.18 corrects §1.17's "separate, deeper undertaking" overstatement).
- [x] **N-22b-3 — wire-up / flip** (one step) — **LANDED.** Reshaped
  `case_I_realization`'s third `hbundle` conjunct from the packaged `hclaim64` (`∃ Qc …`)
  to the narrower `htransport` single-placement witness (matching N-22b-1's `htransport`
  parameter), and reconstructed the `Qc`-non-root packaging in-proof by composing N-22b-1
  (`rigidContract_exterior_rank_transport`, witness `q₀`/`t`) → N-22b-2
  (`exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn_linking_set_proj`, the bounded packaging) at the
  bindings `G := G.deleteEdges E(H)`, `proj := V(H)`, `ends := G.endsOf`. The graph-arg
  mismatch closes by defeq (`panelRow` is graph-independent for `ofNormals`), so the final
  `exact` to the block-triangular coupling unifies with no glue. Blueprint: `lem:claim-6-4`
  gets its `\lean{…}` pins (both bricks) but **stays red** (the honesty gate forbids
  `\leanok` while `htransport` is undischarged with no node); `lem:case-I-realization` stays
  legitimately green via the case-(b) green-modulo pattern. Axiom-clean, build + lint
  warning-clean, `checkdecls` green.

**Build order (reduction):** N-22b-2 (bounded, first buildable) ✓ → N-22b-1 (research-shaped) ✓ →
N-22b-3 (wire-up) ✓. N-22b-2 led because it is the bounded brick whose feasibility was
already re-verified; N-22b-1 then landed the analytic core (carried as `htransport`); the
wire-up composed them. This **reduces** Claim 6.4 to the single hypothesis `htransport`,
green-modulo which `lem:claim-6-4` stays red. (Mirrors 22a's "buildable bricks before the
research-shaped composer" ordering.)

### Discharge plan — the remaining 22b work (route (i): U1/U2/U3b LANDED; the verified 5-commit motive-strengthening sequence is design doc §1.24; supersedes §1.19's U3a/U4)

The discharge cut evolved through §1.18 → §1.24; the current head is **route (i)**, a verified
5-commit motive-strengthening sequence (Commits 1–5 below), reached after U1/U2/U3b landed sound and
§1.23 found the §1.19/§1.20 U3a "alignment transport" was not a leaf. The two earlier-cut nodes that
landed are kept below for the record (U1, U2 = the collapse-relabel reconciliation; U3b = the genuine
KT Claim 6.4 crux, all sound). `Gc := G.deleteEdges E(H)`, `f := collapseTo r V(H)`,
`sc := (V(G)∖V(H)) ∪ {r}`, `D = screwDim k`. **Commit 1 is landed** (edge-restrict + the
`endsOf_fst_ne_snd` distinctness fact); the remaining work opens on **Commit 2** (provable now,
no motive dependency) per `DESIGN.md` *Constructibility recon … → design the LAYER*; the §1.19
single-placement finding (`q₀^deg` = KT's `p2` is itself a valid witness, the "generic ≥ degenerate"
lift already green inside N-22b-2) still stands and feeds Commit 5's `htransport` assembly.

- [x] **U1 — degenerate placement bridge `q₀^deg`** (KT's `p2`, eq. 6.7, H-side collapsed) —
  **LANDED.** `degeneratePlacement r t nrm : α × Fin (k+2) → ℝ := fun p ↦ nrm (collapseTo r t p.1) p.2`
  (`CaseI.lean`), the plain pullback of a normal field through the collapse map: bodies of `V(H)`
  all take the representative normal `nrm r`, surviving bodies keep `nrm a`. The reproduction
  `degeneratePlacement_ofNormals_normal` records `(ofNormals … (degeneratePlacement …)).normal a =
  nrm (collapseTo r t a)` (`rw [ofNormals_normal]; rfl`). *No* genericity/moment-curve — the witness
  is the degenerate member (design doc §1.19, Finding 2). `degeneratePlacement_ofNormals_normal` is
  *not* `@[simp]` (its LHS reduces by the existing `ofNormals_normal`; `simpNF` flagged the eager
  `@[simp]`, dropped per the Lean-CLAUDE.md gate). Axiom-clean, build + lint warning-clean.
- [x] **U2 — collapse-relabel projected-row reproduction** *(the crux; the live part of §1.18's
  T2a+T2b)* — **LANDED.** Column core landed in the U2 opening (`hingeRow_collapseTo_comp_extProj_eq`
  + `extProj_apply_collapseTo` / `extProj_apply_not_mem`); **this commit lands the per-edge tail**
  `panelRow_collapseTo_comp_extProj_dualMap` (`CaseI.lean`): for any index `i`, the projected
  uncollapsed surviving-edge `panelRow` of `ofNormals Gc ends q₀^deg` equals the projected collapsed
  `panelRow` of `ofNormals (Gc.map f) endsᶠ q₀^deg'` over the contracted graph. Both framings read the
  *same* support extensor (the degenerate placement's normal is `nrm ∘ f` either way) hence the *same*
  annihilator functional; the only difference is the `hingeRow` endpoints — uncollapsed `(ends e)` vs.
  relabelled `(f (ends e))` — which the column core reconciles under `(extProj V(H)).dualMap`. Proof:
  a `rw` chain through `panelRow`/`toBodyHinge_supportExtensor`/`ofNormals_{ends,normal}`/
  `dualMap_apply'`, then `dsimp only [degeneratePlacement]`, then the column core. This IS §1.7's
  irreducible collapse-normal *row* reconciliation as a single per-edge row equality — sound and done.
  **Caveat (corrected 2026-06-05, §1.20): this retires the collapse-relabel *row* crux, NOT the whole
  Claim-6.4 content.** The *projected-rank-preservation* crux (KT Claim 6.4 proper) is separate and
  moved to **U3b**. Axiom-clean, build + lint warning-clean.
**Route (i) (motive strengthening) DECIDED; the 5-commit sequence is verified buildable (design doc
§1.24).** §1.20's U3a/U4 (the alignment transport + the assemble/flip) are superseded by this
sequence: U3a's "move the IH rigidity to the `endsᵐ` selector via the swap brick" was found not a
leaf (§1.23 — the motive carries a *free* `ends`), so route (i) strengthens the motive to carry "the
realization's `ends` records its own graph's links" (generic-motive only, §1.24 item 1) and U3a's
transport *then derives*. Commits 1–2 are provable now; Commit 3 is the big mechanical re-type;
Commits 4–5 are the (now-buildable) U3a + U4. Each:

- [x] **Commit 1 — edge-restrict `hasGenericRealization_transport_ends`'s `hne_ends` + add the
  `endsOf`-on-links distinctness fact** (*first buildable; no motive dependency*) — **LANDED.** The
  all-`β` `hne_ends : ∀ e, (ends e).1 ≠ (ends e).2` is unsatisfiable for `ends = G.endsOf` (junk
  `(default,default)` on non-edges, `Operations.lean:81`); restricted the brick's `hne_ends`
  (`CaseI.lean`) to the linking edges `∀ e, GH.IsLink e (ends e).1 (ends e).2 → (ends e).1 ≠ (ends
  e).2` — where `supportExtensor_ne_zero_of_isGeneralPosition` actually reads it (the conjunct it
  proves was already link-restricted, so the proof gains the link `he` for free: `fun e _` → `fun e
  he`). Added the distinctness fact `Graph.endsOf_fst_ne_snd` (`Operations.lean`, beside
  `endsOf_eq_or_swap`): for `[G.Loopless]` and `e ∈ E(G)`, `(G.endsOf e).1 ≠ (G.endsOf e).2`, one
  line off `(isLink_endsOf he).ne` (mathlib/Matroid `IsLink.ne` for loopless graphs). The composer's
  `hbundle` second conjunct edge-restricted in step (against `G`-links); its single call site feeds
  the brick via `fun e he => hne_ends e (he.of_le hle)` (`H`-link's `ends`-endpoints form a `G`-link).
  Closes risk (a). `case_I_realization` stays green-modulo `htransport` (no node yet consumes the
  edge-restricted bundle, so `endsOf_fst_ne_snd` is not yet *used* to discharge it — that is Commit 4).
  All axiom-clean (`propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`), build + lint warning-clean.
- [ ] **Commit 2 — the `linkRecording (ofNormals G G.endsOf q₀) G` bridge lemma** (*provable now; no
  re-type yet*). The canonical-`endsOf` realization records `G`'s links (`.ends e = G.endsOf e` by
  `ofNormals_ends`; link-recording by `isLink_endsOf`). This is the term every fresh producer hands
  the strengthened motive — stating it before the re-type de-risks Commit 3.
- [ ] **Commit 3 — the re-type of `HasGenericFullRankRealization`** (*big mechanical; no missing deps
  after 1–2*). Add the link-recording conjunct
  (`∀ e u v, G.IsLink e u v → ((Q.ends e).1 = u ∧ (Q.ends e).2 = v) ∨ swap`) to the `def`
  (`PanelHinge:938`); thread it through every conclusion site (the 6 fresh producers, each supplied
  by Commit 2; `hbaseGP`; the `theorem_55_generic` motive `Pc`; the composer forwarding from the IH);
  re-destructure every `let ⟨Q, hQg, hQgp, hQrig⟩` consumer. `hasFullRankRealization_of_generic`
  (`:948`) forgets the new conjunct as it forgets GP (one extra `_`).
- [ ] **Commit 4 — discharge `hswap`/`hne_ends` from the strengthened bundle + build U3a.** The `H`-leg
  `hswap` derives via the already-landed `endsOf_eq_or_swap` (`Operations.lean:102`); the
  contraction-leg alignment via the new **`IsLink.map`-under-`collapseTo`** lemma (the one small new
  brick, off mathlib `Graph.map_isLink`; `endsᵐ := collapseTo r V(H) ∘ ends` records the contracted
  link — risk (c)); then transport `Qcf`'s rigidity on `sc = V(Gc.map f)` to the `endsᵐ` selector via
  `infinitesimalMotions_ofNormals_eq_of_ends_swap`. This is §1.20's U3a plan, now buildable.
- [ ] **U3b — pin-the-`r`-column projected-rank brick (O2; the genuine KT Claim 6.4 crux).** From
  `Qcf'` rigid on `sc`, show the exterior-column projection `(extProj V(H)).dualMap` — which drops
  *exactly the `r`-column* (`r` = the only `Qcf'` vertex in `V(H)`) — preserves independent rank
  `≥ D(|sc|−1)`. **Build-recon done + CORRECTED (design doc §1.22, this commit): §1.21's "one-line
  Lemma 5.1 corollary" was WRONG.** §1.21 read `Qcf'` rigid on `sc` as `finrank(Z) = D` ⟹
  `finrank(pinnedMotions r) = 0` ⟹ zero rank loss. But `Qcf'` is rigid on its **vertex set** `sc`,
  generally a *proper* subset of `α`, so `finrank(Z) = D(|scᶜ|+1)` (green
  `finrank_infinitesimalMotions_of_isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_vertexSet`), **not** `D` —
  `finrank(pinnedMotions r) = D·|scᶜ| ≠ 0`, and `(extProj V(H)).dualMap` does NOT drop the free
  isolated columns. The clean `D(|sc|−1)` survives only via an **exact free-isolated-body
  cancellation**, which must be proven. **Corrected, verified-closing layer (§1.22):** the brick
  reduces to `Φ ⊓ ker D = ⊥` (`D` injective on `Φ = span(linking rows)`, `finrank Φ = D(|sc|−1)` by
  green `span_panelRow_linking_eq_rigidityRows`), and by the mathlib dual API
  (`ker_dualMap_eq_dualAnnihilator_range` + `dualAnnihilator_sup_eq` + double-annihilator) that is
  `Z ⊔ range(extProj V(H)) = ⊤`. The **one real-content fact** is the rigid-block pin-count
  `finrank(F.pinnedMotionsOn V(H)) = D(|scᶜ| − |V(H)| + 1)` (`V(H)∩sc={r}`; pinning the `|V(H)|−1`
  isolated bodies of `V(H)∖{r} ⊆ scᶜ` removes `D(|V(H)|−1)` from `pinnedMotions r`'s `D·|scᶜ|`). All
  mathlib + green project facts confirmed present; the genuine kernel is a small product-space iso
  peeling the free isolated columns + an `extProj_range = ⨅ i ∈ V(H), ker(proj i)` identity. **Build
  opens on the pin-count sub-lemma** (the walling node, §1.22). The un-projected U3 tool does **not**
  suffice (projection can lower rank — the whole point of Claim 6.4).
  **U3b — pin-count walling node LANDED (this commit).** The §1.22 walling node is green
  (`Pinning.lean`): `finrank_pinnedMotionsOn_of_isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_vertexSet_inter_eq_singleton`
  — for `F` rigid on its vertex set and a block `t` with `V(F) ∩ t = {r}`,
  `finrank(F.pinnedMotionsOn t) = D·(|V(F)ᶜ| + 1 − |t|)` (the §1.22 pin-count, with the ℕ count
  stated subtraction-last per TACTICS-GOLF § 13 — the `|Vᶜ| − |t| + 1` real-arithmetic form
  truncates wrong at the boundary `t = {r} ∪ Vᶜ`). Built off two new supporting bricks
  (`pinnedMotionsOn_eq_iInf_ker_proj_of_vertexSet_subset` + `finrank_pinnedMotionsOn_of_vertexSet_subset`,
  the `s ⊇ V(G)` generalization of the green `pinnedMotionsOn_vertexSet_eq_iInf_ker_proj` /
  `finrank_pinnedMotionsOn_vertexSet`): pinning `t` ⇒ (rigidity propagates `S r = 0` over `V(F)`) ⇒
  `pinnedMotionsOn t = pinnedMotionsOn (V(F) ∪ t)`, whose dimension is the exact free-isolated count
  `D·|(V(F) ∪ t)ᶜ|`, then incl.–excl. on `|V(F) ∩ t| = 1`. All three axiom-clean
  (`propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`), build + lint warning-clean.
  **U3b — `Z ⊔ W = ⊤` dual-annihilator assembly LANDED (this commit).** The §1.22 closing fact is
  green (`CaseI.lean`): `infinitesimalMotions_sup_range_extProj_eq_top` — for `F` rigid on its vertex
  set and `proj` with `V(F) ∩ proj = {r}`, `Z ⊔ range(extProj proj) = ⊤`
  (`Z = infinitesimalMotions`). Built off two new supporting bricks
  (`extProj_range_eq_iInf_ker_proj`: `range(extProj proj) = ⨅ i∈proj, ker(proj i)`, since `extProj`
  is an idempotent coordinate projection; and `infinitesimalMotions_inf_range_extProj_eq_pinnedMotionsOn`:
  `Z ⊓ range(extProj proj) = pinnedMotionsOn proj`, the defining motion-and-vanishing conjunction),
  then the §1.22 inclusion–exclusion via `Submodule.finrank_sup_add_finrank_inf_eq` on the three
  confirmed dimensions: `finrank Z = D(|Vᶜ|+1)` (rigid-on-vertexSet), `finrank W = D·|projᶜ|`
  (`finrank_iInf_ker_proj_eq`), `finrank(Z⊓W) = D(|Vᶜ|+1−|proj|)` (the landed pin-count walling
  node). The count closes by `omega` after distributing `D` over the `ncard`-level identity by hand
  (`omega` can't multiply — the documented TACTICS-QUIRKS § 1 atom-matching idiom: a `have hdist`
  factors the multiplication so `omega` sees matching `D*·` atoms). All three axiom-clean
  (`propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`), build + lint warning-clean.
  **U3b — projected-subfamily extraction LANDED (this commit), so all of U3b is now green.** Two
  bricks in `CaseI.lean`: (1) the §1.22-injective-form core
  `BodyHingeFramework.injOn_extProj_dualMap_rigidityRows` — for `F` rigid on its vertex set with
  `V(F) ∩ proj = {r}`, `(extProj proj).dualMap` is `Set.InjOn` on `Φ = span rigidityRows` (i.e.
  `Φ ⊓ ker D = ⊥` — the projection loses zero rank), via the dual-API chain on the landed
  `Z ⊔ W = ⊤`: `ker D = W.dualAnnihilator` (`ker_dualMap_eq_dualAnnihilator_range`),
  `Φ = Z.dualAnnihilator` (`Z = Φ.dualCoannihilator` + `Subspace.dualCoannihilator_dualAnnihilator_eq`),
  `Φ ⊓ ker D = (Z ⊔ W).dualAnnihilator` (`dualAnnihilator_sup_eq`) `= ⊤.dualAnnihilator = ⊥`, then
  `LinearMap.injOn_of_disjoint_ker` via `disjoint_iff`; (2) the extraction proper
  `BodyHingeFramework.exists_independent_panelRow_subfamily_of_rigidOn_linking_set_proj`. **Simpler
  than the recon's "projected U3-tool skeleton":** rather than re-run the
  `exists_fun_fin_finrank_span_eq` span/finrank skeleton with a projected `finrank` bridge, it calls
  the **green un-projected tool** `exists_independent_panelRow_subfamily_of_rigidOn_linking` for the
  size-`≥ D(|V(F)|−1)` independent subfamily, then maps it through `D` by
  `LinearIndependent.map_injOn` — the rows live in `Φ` (each links ⟹ is a rigidity row, the composer's
  `hrow_mem` pattern), where `D` is injective, so the projected family is independent of the *same*
  size and the projected count drops out of the un-projected count for free. Both axiom-clean
  (`propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound`), build + lint warning-clean.
- [ ] **Commit 5 — U4: assemble `htransport` + flip + phase-close.** U3b (landed) gives
  projected-*collapsed* independence; U2 (landed) carries it to projected-*uncollapsed* rows at
  `q₀^deg`; assemble `(q₀^deg, t, hsupp, hcount, hindep)` into `htransport`, translating subfamily
  indices from `Gc.map f`-links (at `endsᵐ`) to `Gc`-links (at parent `ends`) via a `Gc`-link
  `hends`; delete `htransport` (and, with route (i), the `H`-leg `hswap`) from `case_I_realization`'s
  `hbundle`; `\leanok` `lem:claim-6-4`; then the full phase-close ceremony (`CLAUDE.md` *When this
  commit closes a phase*). Plumbing; low risk.

## Blockers / settled in the opening recon

- **Sub-phase cut — SETTLED.** 22b's scope is *just Claim 6.4*, cut into the three
  nodes N-22b-1/2/3 above (build order: N-22b-2 → N-22b-1 → N-22b-3).
- **Renumbering — SETTLED: the parked territory renumbers `22b+` → `22c+`.** 22b is
  now a distinct, tightly-scoped sub-phase (one deliverable, Claim 6.4), so the parked
  Case-III-at-`d=3` + `d=3`-assembly body of work should not share its label.
  Renumber the old "22b+" row to **22c+** (still a single planning placeholder,
  expected to split into multiple sub-phases — 22c = Case III at `d=3` / Track B,
  22d = the `d=3` assembly is the *likely* further cut, but that finer split is
  deferred until 22c opens, exactly as 22a deferred the 22b+ cut). Rationale: each
  sub-letter names one distinct sub-phase; "22b+" conflated 22b's discharge with a
  separate multi-phase undertaking. The integer phase numbers 23–26 stay stable
  (Track B at general `d`, the matroid/projective/molecule capstones). This recon
  applies the renumber to ROADMAP, `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`, and the user-facing
  surfaces in the same commit.
- **Recurring Lean traps** (FRICTION; `notes/Phase22a.md` *Hand-off*): the heavy
  `IsInfinitesimallyRigidOn` defeq across `ofNormals`/`withGraph` graph-swaps (state
  hypotheses pre-converted; transfer across an `infinitesimalMotions` equality needs
  a `mem_infinitesimalMotions` round-trip); a leading `|>.proj` on a wrapped
  continuation line can fail to parse (use prefix-application form).

## Hand-off / next phase

**22b is discharging `htransport`; U1 + U2 + ALL of U3b landed (sound); route (i) DECIDED +
scope-verified. Commit 1 of 5 landed; the next concrete commit is Commit 2.** The
reduction N-22b-1/2/3 landed (KT Claim 6.4 formalized down to the single hypothesis `htransport`);
`lem:claim-6-4` carries its `\lean{…}` pins but stays red, `lem:case-I-realization` stays legitimately
green-modulo via the case-(b) pattern, ROADMAP row stays ◷. U1 + U2 + U3b are landed and **sound**.
**Route-(i) Commit 1 is landed** (this commit): `hasGenericRealization_transport_ends`'s `hne_ends`
edge-restricted to linking edges + the distinctness fact `Graph.endsOf_fst_ne_snd` (`Operations.lean`,
off `IsLink.ne` for loopless graphs); the composer's `hbundle` second conjunct edge-restricted in step,
its single call site adapted (`fun e he => hne_ends e (he.of_le hle)`). Closes risk (a).

**The next concrete commit is Commit 2: the `linkRecording (ofNormals G G.endsOf q₀) G` bridge lemma**
(`CaseI.lean`; provable now, no re-type yet — the canonical-`endsOf` realization records `G`'s links
via `ofNormals_ends` + `isLink_endsOf`; the term every fresh producer hands the strengthened motive,
stated before the Commit-3 re-type to de-risk it). Then the rest of the verified route-(i) 5-commit
sequence (the *Discharge plan*): Commit 3 (the big mechanical re-type of `HasGenericFullRankRealization`
adding the link-recording conjunct, threaded through all 6 fresh producers + `hbaseGP` +
`theorem_55_generic` + the composer; consumers re-destructured) → Commit 4 (discharge
`hswap`/`hne_ends` from the bundle + build U3a: `H`-leg via the landed `endsOf_eq_or_swap`,
contraction-leg via the one new `IsLink.map`-under-`collapseTo` lemma) → Commit 5 (assemble
`htransport`, delete it + the `H`-leg `hswap` from `hbundle`, `\leanok` `lem:claim-6-4`, phase-close
ceremony).

**Route (i) decided + scope-verified (design doc §1.24, `c880b9f`).** §1.23 found
discharging `htransport` (or the parallel `H`-leg `hswap`) needs an IH realization rigid at a
selector that *records its graph's links*, which `HasGenericFullRankRealization`'s free `ends` does
not carry — so the user decided route (i) (strengthen the motive to carry that invariant). The §1.24
recon **confirms the scope**: it is generic-motive-only (the bare motive + `theorem_55` stay
untouched), every fresh producer supplies the new conjunct for free from the canonical `endsOf`, and
the three risk items hold — (a) edge-restrict `hne_ends` (Commit 1, now **landed**); (b) the
`hswap`-discharge bridge `endsOf_eq_or_swap` is already landed; (c) the contraction-leg
`IsLink.map`-under-`collapseTo` is one small derived lemma off mathlib `Graph.map_isLink`, not a wall.
Do **not** re-recon the scope — build Commit 2.

**Course-correction (design doc §1.20).** The U2-opening session **forked under backgrounding**; its
post-reset hand-off claimed "walling retired, U3+U4 plumbing" — **wrong**. The collapse-relabel
*row* crux (U2) is genuinely retired, but **KT Claim 6.4 proper — that the exterior-column
projection `(extProj V(H)).dualMap` (dropping the `r`-column) preserves rank `D(|sc|−1)` — is a
pin-a-body fact needing a MISSING brick, and it sits in U3b.** The crux did not vanish; it moved from
U2 to U3. §1.20 carries the recovered O1 (alignment, solved-in-principle) / O2 (projected rank, the
crux) analysis + the corrected cut.

The U3b **build-recon is done and corrected** (design doc §1.21 → **§1.22**): §1.21's "bounded
one-line Lemma 5.1 corollary" was wrong (it assumed `finrank(Z)=D`; `Qcf'` is rigid on its vertex
set `sc ⊊ α`, so `finrank(Z)=D(|scᶜ|+1)` and `finrank(pinnedMotions r)=D·|scᶜ|≠0`). §1.22 gives the
verified-closing layer: the brick reduces to `Z ⊔ range(extProj V(H)) = ⊤` (mathlib dual API), one
real-content fact = the rigid-block pin-count `finrank(F.pinnedMotionsOn V(H)) = D(|scᶜ|−|V(H)|+1)`.
**§1.22 was independently coordinator-verified** via a from-scratch motion-space decomposition (see
§1.22 *Coordinator verification*) — the layer is sound; do **not** re-recon it, build it.

**ALL THREE U3b bricks are LANDED — the genuine KT Claim 6.4 crux is fully bricked.** The §1.22
pin-count walling node `finrank_pinnedMotionsOn_of_isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_vertexSet_inter_eq_singleton`
(`Pinning.lean`, `0f0e7aa`); the §1.22 `Z ⊔ W = ⊤` dual-annihilator assembly
`infinitesimalMotions_sup_range_extProj_eq_top` (`CaseI.lean`, `6b004b8`); and the
§1.22 projected-subfamily extraction (`CaseI.lean`, `8bafe8d`): the injective-form core
`injOn_extProj_dualMap_rigidityRows` (`(extProj proj).dualMap` injective on `Φ = span rigidityRows`,
i.e. `Φ ⊓ ker D = ⊥` — projection loses zero rank — off `Z ⊔ W = ⊤` via the dual-annihilator API
`ker_dualMap_eq_dualAnnihilator_range`/`Subspace.dualCoannihilator_dualAnnihilator_eq`/`dualAnnihilator_sup_eq`/`dualAnnihilator_top`)
+ the extraction proper `exists_independent_panelRow_subfamily_of_rigidOn_linking_set_proj`, which is
**simpler than the recon's "projected U3-tool skeleton"**: it calls the green un-projected tool
`exists_independent_panelRow_subfamily_of_rigidOn_linking` and maps the subfamily through
`(extProj proj).dualMap` by `LinearIndependent.map_injOn` (rows in `Φ` ⟹ `D` injective ⟹ projected
family independent of the *same* size, count for free) — no projected `finrank` bridge. All axiom-clean,
build + lint warning-clean.

**The §1.23 route decision is settled: route (i).** §1.23 surfaced three options — (i) strengthen
the motive, (ii) keep the alignment conjuncts as explicit `hbundle` hypotheses and defer, (iii)
re-localize the contracted realization. The **user chose (i)**, and the §1.24 scope-verification
recon confirmed it buildable (generic-motive-only; producers supply link-recording from `endsOf`;
the three risk items hold). The 5-commit sequence above is route (i)'s realization. The full
phase-close fires on Commit 5 (`CLAUDE.md` *When this commit closes a phase*: flip ROADMAP row to ✓
+ compress its section, sync user-facing surfaces `README.md` / `home_page/index.md` /
`blueprint/src/chapter/intro.tex`, sync `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`, broadened blueprint re-read +
`BlueprintExposition` ledger).

The surrounding territory (22c+: Case III at `d=3` + the `d=3` assembly) can proceed in parallel — it
depends on the green infra (N7b row sub-nodes, N7a, the device), not on `htransport`.

Cross-references rather than re-derivation: `notes/Phase22-realization-design.md`
**§1.24** (route (i) scope-verification + the 5-commit sequence: generic-motive-only, producers
supply link-recording from `endsOf`, the three risk items confirmed; Commit 1 now landed, the next
concrete commit is Commit 2), §1.23 (the U3a build-recon: the alignment is NOT a leaf — the IH motive carries a free
`ends`, so the swap transport is not derivable; the same gap is the undischarged `H`-leg `hswap`; fix

alignment solved-in-principle [now corrected by §1.23] / O2 projected-rank = the
