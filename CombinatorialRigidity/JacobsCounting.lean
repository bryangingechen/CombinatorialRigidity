# The counting bound for Laman squares: edge classification (`sec:jacobs-counting`)

Phase 32. Jackson–Jordán 2008 (*On the rigidity of molecular graphs*, Combinatorica **28**)
prove their counting bound (Theorem 5.3) by classifying the edges of `G²` against a partition
of `V` attaining the deficiency. This file lays the foundations that classification needs:
the bridge from the `SimpleGraph V` square `G²` to the `Graph`-carrier tight-partition
machinery of `Molecular/Deficiency.lean`, and the four edge classes with the structural facts
that make them well defined.

## The shadow-carrier bridge (encoding decision (b))

A "tight partition of `V` at `D = 6`" is, concretely, a labeling `f : V → V` that is a tight
partition of the shadowing multigraph `G.shadowGraph` (`Molecular/Molecule/Carrier.lean`) at
`n = 3` (where `bodyBarDim 3 = 6`); the packaged predicate is `SimpleGraph.IsSquareTightPartition`.
The shadow graph has `V(G.shadowGraph) = univ` and `G.shadowGraph.Adj = G.Adj`
(`shadowGraph_adj_iff`), so the tight-partition lemmas of `Molecular/Deficiency.lean` — stated
`D`-generically over `Graph α β` — transport directly to `SimpleGraph`/`f : V → V` language. The
one transported here is common-neighbor uniqueness (`IsTightPartition.eq_of_common_nbr`, JJ
Lemma 3.2 at `D ≥ 5`): `IsSquareTightPartition.eq_of_common_nbr`.

## The four edge classes (encoding decision (a))

Following Jackson–Jordán §5, an edge `e = uw` of `G²` is classified by two binary criteria — do
its endpoints share a part (`(e.map f).IsDiag`, i.e. `f u = f w`), and is `e` an edge of `G`:

* `squareInPartEdges` — edges of `G²` inside a part;
* `squareGCrossEdges` — edges of `G` joining distinct parts (their count is `d_G(P)`);
* `squareCrossEdges` — **cross edges**: edges of `G²` joining distinct parts that are not edges
  of `G`. Such an edge has a common neighbor (`exists_apex_of_mem_squareCrossEdges`), unique
  under tightness (`IsSquareTightPartition.eq_of_common_nbr`).

A cross edge `uw` with common neighbor `v` is **normal** if `v` shares a part with an endpoint
(`f v ∈ e.map f`) and **special** otherwise:

* `squareNormalCrossEdges`, `squareSpecialCrossEdges`.

## Main results

* `SimpleGraph.square_edgeSet_eq_union` — `E(G²)` is the union of the in-part, `G`-cross, and
  cross classes, pairwise disjoint (`disjoint_inPart_gCross`, `disjoint_inPart_cross`,
  `disjoint_gCross_cross`).
* `SimpleGraph.squareCrossEdges_eq_union` — cross edges split as normal ∪ special,
* `SimpleGraph.squareNormalCrossEdges_disjoint_special` — disjointly, under tightness;
* `SimpleGraph.squareGCrossEdges_ncard_eq_crossingEdges` — the `G`-cross class numbers `d_G(P)`.

Together these are the disjoint-union half of `lem:square-cross-classification`. The *moreover*
clause is the common-neighbor-part characterization, established here by transporting
`Graph.IsTightPartition.parts` (`SimpleGraph.IsSquareTightPartition.parts`) and using
`SimpleGraph.IsLaman3.degree_le_three`:

* `SimpleGraph.squareSpecialCrossEdges_singleton_part` — the common neighbor of a special cross
  edge forms a singleton part;
* `SimpleGraph.squareNormalCrossEdges_part_three_le` — the common neighbor of a normal cross
  edge lies in a part of ≥ 3 vertices, together with exactly one endpoint of the edge.

This completes `lem:square-cross-classification`. The JJ eq. (5)–(7) counting lemmas
(`lem:singleton-part-neighborhood`, `lem:normal-cross-count`) build on it in later commits. See
`notes/Phase32.md` and `blueprint/src/chapter/jacobs.tex` (`sec:jacobs-counting`).

any two common neighbors `v, v'` coincide. This makes the common neighbor of a cross edge —

/-! ## The classification (moreover clause)

The common-neighbor part of a special cross edge is a singleton, and of a normal cross edge a
part of ≥ 3 vertices containing exactly one endpoint. Both rest on the tight-partition part
dichotomy transported through the shadow bridge (`IsSquareTightPartition.parts`); the special
case additionally uses the Laman degree bound (`IsLaman3.degree_le_three`). This is the
*moreover* clause of `lem:square-cross-classification`. -/

/-- **Part dichotomy for the square's tight partition** (`lem:tight-partition-parts` transported
through the shadow carrier). If two distinct vertices `v ≠ w` share a part (`f w = f v`), then
`v`'s part has at least three vertices and `v` has at least two neighbors inside it. The vertex
half rewrites `Graph.IsTightPartition.parts`'s `V(G.shadowGraph) = univ` slice; the neighbor
half converts its shadow-edge count through the bijection `y ↦ Sum.inl s(v, y)` between `v`'s
in-part shadow-edges and `v`'s in-part `G`-neighbors. -/

cross edge `s(u, w)` forms a singleton part: every vertex with label `f v` is `v` itself.

Both `u` and `w` lie outside `v`'s part (special), so `v` has the two distinct out-of-part
neighbors `u ≠ w`; if `v`'s part were not a singleton, `v` would have two further in-part
neighbors (`IsSquareTightPartition.parts`), giving `v` degree at least four and contradicting the

/-- **Normal cross edge ⇒ common neighbor in a part of ≥ 3 vertices, with exactly one endpoint.**
The common neighbor `v` of a normal cross edge `s(u, w)` shares a part with exactly one endpoint
(the endpoints lie in distinct parts, `f u ≠ f w`), and that part has at least three vertices.

`v` shares its part with the endpoint `u` (or `w`) it is `f`-equal to; those two are adjacent and
distinct, so the part is not a singleton, hence has ≥ 3 vertices
(`IsSquareTightPartition.parts`). -/

/-! ## Special cross edges at a singleton part (`lem:singleton-part-neighborhood`)

For a singleton part `{v}`, `N_G(v)` is a clique of `G²` (`isClique_neighborSet_square`,
unconditional) numbering `2 d_G(v) - 3` edges (`ncard_edgesIn_neighborSet_square`, Phase 32's
`Jacobs.lean`, also unconditional). What the singleton-part hypothesis supplies is that every
one of those clique edges is a *special cross* edge with common neighbor `v`
(JJ eq. (5), (7)): two neighbors of `v` lie in distinct parts (else two edges would cross
between one part and `v`'s singleton part, `not_adj_adj_of_same_part`) and are themselves
nonadjacent in `G` (else a triangle would cross a three-part subfamily,
`not_adj_triangle`), so the edge between them is a cross edge; it is special because `v`'s
singleton part contains neither endpoint, and unique to `v` by `eq_of_common_nbr`. -/

distinct neighbors `u, w` of `v` form a special cross edge of `G²` whose unique common neighbor
