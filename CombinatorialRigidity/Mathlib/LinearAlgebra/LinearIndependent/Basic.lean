# Upstream candidates: independent-family facts

Five facts about linearly independent families, all upstream-eligible.

`LinearIndependent.disjoint_span_range_ker` is the converse companion of mathlib's
`LinearIndependent.map`: if the composite `f ∘ v` is linearly independent, then the span of
`v` meets `ker f` trivially (`Disjoint (span R (range v)) (ker f)`). `LinearIndependent.map`
supplies the forward direction (span-disjoint-from-kernel makes `f ∘ v` independent when `v`
is); this reads the disjointness back off the composite's independence. The rigidity project's
zero-extension lift (`RigidityMatroid.lean`) uses it to discharge the span-disjointness of the
`LinearIndepOn.union` splitting the square's edge rows into the non-incident block and the star
at the new vertex — the star rows survive a test-motion detector `Ψ` whose kernel contains the
non-incident block, so `Ψ ∘ (star rows)` is independent and this lemma turns that into the
required disjointness.

`linearIndependent_sumElim_unit_iff` is the row-space criterion for appending a
single vector to a linearly independent family: over a division ring, augmenting
an independent `v` with one more vector `x` (packaged as `Sum.elim v (fun _ : Unit
=> x)`) stays independent **iff** `x` is not already in the span of `v`. It is the
`Sum.elim … (fun _ : Unit => x)` companion of mathlib's `LinearIndepOn.notMem_span_iff`
(which is phrased for `insert a s`); the `Sum.elim`-of-a-`Unit`-singleton shape is the
one the rigidity project's block-assembly functionals come in (the new block plus one
augmenting candidate row, `RigidityMatrix.lean`'s candidate-completion).

The proof is `linearIndependent_sum` (the iff splitting an `ι ⊕ ι'` family into the two
sub-families plus span-disjointness) specialised to `ι' = Unit`, where the second
sub-family is the singleton `{x}` and span-disjointness `Disjoint (span (range v)) (K ∙ x)`
collapses to `x ∉ span (range v)` by `Submodule.disjoint_span_singleton'`.

`linearIndependent_sumElim_block_swap` is the block row-operation fact: for a base family
`base` and a candidate block `cand` with `Sum.elim base cand` independent, replacing `cand` by
any `cand'` whose entries differ from `cand`'s index-wise by members of `span (range base)`
keeps the augmented family independent. It is the "adding to each candidate row a combination of
the base rows preserves rank" fact; the proof passes to `M ⧸ span (range base)` (where `cand` and
`cand'` have the same image) and rebuilds via `LinearIndependent.sumElim_of_quotient`. The
rigidity project's general-`d` Case III consumes it (in the `Sum.elim (Sum.elim rn cand) ro`
shape, `RigidityMatrix/Basic.lean`'s `linearIndependent_sumElim_candidateBlock_swap`) as the
length-`d` chain row-correspondence.

`linearIndependent_sum_smul_ne_zero` is the elementary fact that a finite linear
combination `∑ j, c j • v j` of a linearly independent family with at least one
nonzero coefficient `c i ≠ 0` is nonzero (the contrapositive of
`Fintype.linearIndependent_iff`: a vanishing combination forces all coefficients to
vanish, in particular `c i`).

`exists_smul_combination_eq_sub_of_mem_span_image_compl` turns a membership
`w ∈ span (v '' {j ≠ i})` into the explicit unit-normalized vanishing combination it
witnesses: over a nontrivial ring, for an independent family `v` and an index `i`, if
`w` lies in the span of the other vectors `{v j : j ≠ i}` then there is a coefficient
family `lam` with `lam i = 1` and `∑ j, lam j • v j = v i - w` — and this combination is
nonzero (the unit coefficient at `i`, via `linearIndependent_sum_smul_ne_zero`). It is
the coefficient-extraction (`Fintype.mem_span_image_iff_exists_fun` to get the `j ≠ i`
coefficients, extended by `lam i = 1`) the rigidity project's redundant-row decomposition
consumes (KT eqs. (6.24)/(6.25): the redundant row `v i` minus its expansion `w` over the
others is the candidate vector `r̂`, with the redundant index's coefficient pinned to `1`).

Promotion to mathlib: copy-paste into `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/LinearIndependent/Basic.lean`
(it imports `linearIndependent_sum` there, `disjoint_span_singleton'` from `Span.Basic`,
`Fintype.linearIndependent_iff`, and `Fintype.mem_span_image_iff_exists_fun` from
`Finsupp.LinearCombination`). `linearIndependent_sumElim_block_swap` additionally needs
`Submodule.mkQ`/`ker_mkQ` from `Quotient.Basic` and `LinearIndependent.sumElim_of_quotient`
from `Dimension.Constructions` (so it would land downstream of those, not in `Basic`).

`Disjoint (span R (range v)) (ker f)`. Converse companion of `LinearIndependent.map` (which
proves `f ∘ v` independent from `v` independent and this disjointness); here the disjointness
is read back off the composite's independence: an element of the intersection is a finite
combination `∑ cᵢ • v i` sent to `0` by `f`, so `∑ cᵢ • f (v i) = 0`, forcing every `cᵢ = 0`
by independence of `f ∘ v`, hence the element is `0`. -/

/-- **A block row operation preserves independence: swapping a candidate block by members
of the base block's span.** Over a division ring, for a base family
`base : ι → M` and a candidate block `cand : ιc → M` with `Sum.elim base cand` linearly
independent, if a second candidate block `cand'` differs from `cand` index-wise by members of
`span (range base)` (each `cand' i - cand i ∈ span (range base)`), then `Sum.elim base cand'`
is again linearly independent.

This is the block form of "adding to each candidate row a combination of the base rows does
not change the rank." The proof passes to the quotient `Q := M ⧸ span (range base)`: there
`mkQ ∘ cand' = mkQ ∘ cand` (the differences vanish in `Q`), and `Sum.elim base cand`
independence makes `mkQ ∘ cand` independent in `Q`, so `LinearIndependent.sumElim_of_quotient`
rebuilds `Sum.elim base cand'` from the (submodule-valued) base block and the unchanged
quotient block. -/
