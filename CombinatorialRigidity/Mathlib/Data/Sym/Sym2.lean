# Upstream candidates: pointwise reasoning about `Sym2.map f e = s(x, y)`

Mathlib has `Sym2.mem_map` for membership of a single element of `β` in
`Sym2.map f z`, and `Sym2.coe_map` for the underlying-set coercion. What was
missing — and repeatedly needed in the combinatorial-rigidity project — is a
*pointwise* characterization, in terms of `f`-preimages, of the situation
"there is an `e` with property `P` such that `Sym2.map f e` equals a specific
ordered pair `s(x, y)`."

The main lemma here is `Sym2.exists_and_map_eq_mk_iff`:

```
(∃ e, P e ∧ Sym2.map f e = s(x, y)) ↔ ∃ p q, f p = x ∧ f q = y ∧ P s(p, q)
```

This is the form that `simp` reaches automatically: starting from
`s(x, y) ∈ Sym2.map f '' S`, the lemma `Set.mem_image` (a `@[simp]` lemma)
unfolds to `∃ e, e ∈ S ∧ Sym2.map f e = s(x, y)`, after which membership in `S`
may have been further unfolded by other simp lemmas (e.g. `Set.mem_diff` if `S`
is a difference). The predicate-form lemma matches regardless.

We also provide the more direct (non-`@[simp]`) form
`Sym2.mk_mem_image_map_iff`, which talks about image membership before
`Set.mem_image` fires; it is convenient for hand-driven rewriting. The `f =
some` specializations close the loop for the `Option`-vertex extensions used in
this project.

The Lean namespace is the upstream one (`Sym2`), so promotion to mathlib is a
copy-paste alongside `Sym2.mem_map` / `Sym2.coe_map`. See
`Archive/CombinatorialRigidity/DESIGN.md` "Mirror directory".

## Contents (target file: `Mathlib/Data/Sym/Sym2.lean`)

* `Sym2.exists_and_map_eq_mk_iff` — `(∃ e, P e ∧ Sym2.map f e = s(x, y)) ↔
  ∃ p q, f p = x ∧ f q = y ∧ P s(p, q)`. Tagged `@[simp]`.
* `Sym2.mk_mem_image_map_iff` — image-membership form:
  `s(x, y) ∈ Sym2.map f '' S ↔ ∃ p q, f p = x ∧ f q = y ∧ s(p, q) ∈ S`.
* `Sym2.mk_mem_image_map_some_iff` — `f = some` specialization, recasting the
  `f p = x` / `f q = y` clauses with `some` on the right (the orientation that
  matches `rcases x with _ | u` case splits).
* `Sym2.map_some_injective` — `Sym2.map (some : α → Option α)` is injective.
  A common specialization that otherwise reads as
  `Sym2.map.injective (Option.some_injective _)`.

variable {α β : Type*}

/-- "Predicate-form" pointwise inverse of `Sym2.map`: a value `s(x, y)` is in
the image of an `e` satisfying `P` iff there is a preimage pair `(p, q)` with
`f p = x`, `f q = y`, and `P s(p, q)`. The asymmetry in `(p, q)` is harmless by
`Sym2.eq_swap`.

This is the form that survives `simp`'s unfolding of `Set.mem_image` and any
further unfolding of the membership predicate (e.g. `Set.mem_diff` for set
differences). Tagged `@[simp]` so image-membership goals close in one pass. -/

preimage pair `(p, q)` with `f p = x`, `f q = y`, and `s(p, q) ∈ S`.

This is the "natural" hand-driven form. The companion `simp`-form
`Sym2.exists_and_map_eq_mk_iff` is what fires inside an automated rewrite. -/

/-- `Option`-edge specialization of `Sym2.mk_mem_image_map_iff`: the membership
question for `Sym2.map (some : α → Option α) '' S` factors cleanly through
"both endpoints are `some _`" plus membership of the corresponding honest edge.
The `x = some p` orientation (rather than `some p = x`) matches what `rcases x
with _ | u` produces. -/
