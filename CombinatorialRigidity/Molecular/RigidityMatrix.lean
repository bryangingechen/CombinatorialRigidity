# The panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` (`sec:molecular-rigidity-matrix`)

Phase 18, the second phase of the molecular-conjecture program (Phases 17–26; see
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). Where the body-hinge chapter (Phase 16,
`BodyBar/BodyHinge.lean`) *defined* rigidity by reduction to body-bar on the
multiplied graph `(δ-1)·G` (a standard-basis witness, no honest geometry — the
*existence* form), this file builds the **genuine** panel-hinge / body-hinge
rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` of Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 (*A proof of the molecular
conjecture*, Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, §2.2–2.4), on a realization `p`
assigning a `(d-2)`-dimensional affine *hinge* subspace to each edge.

This file lands the `sec:molecular-rigidity-matrix` dep-graph in dependency order.
The leaf node landing here:

* `BodyHingeFramework` (`def:hinge-constraint`) — a `d`-dimensional body-hinge
  framework `(G,p)` is a multigraph `G : Graph α β` together with a map `p`
  assigning each edge a *hinge*: a `(d-1)`-point family in `ℝ^d` whose affine span
  is a `(d-2)`-dimensional affine subspace. Reparametrizing `d = k+1` to clear the
  `ℕ`-subtraction, a hinge is `Fin k → Fin (k+1) → ℝ` (`k` points in `ℝ^(k+1)`),
  homogenizing to `ℝ^(k+2)`; its supporting `(d-1)`-extensor is the `k`-extensor
  `C(p(e)) = affineSubspaceExtensor (p e) ∈ ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` of Phase 17.
* `hingeConstraint` (`def:hinge-constraint`) — identifying an infinitesimal motion
  of a rigid body with a `D`-dimensional *screw center* `S(v)` living in the
  exterior algebra `ExteriorAlgebra ℝ (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)` (where `C(p(e))` lives), the
  hinge `p(e)` constrains the two screw centers `S(u), S(v)` of its endpoints
  `e = uv` to satisfy
  `S(u) - S(v) ∈ span C(p(e)) = Submodule.span ℝ {affineSubspaceExtensor (p e)}`.

## Carrier and dimension

Infinitesimal motions are `D`-dimensional screw centers with `D = (d+1 choose 2)`,
matching Phase 17's extensor space `⋀^(d-1) ℝ^(d+1) ≅ ℝ^D` (here, with `d = k+1`,
`⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)`). We carry the screw center as an element of the **degree-`k` graded
piece** `⋀[ℝ]^k (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)` of the exterior algebra — the subspace in which the
supporting extensors `C(p(e)) = affineSubspaceExtensor (p e)` actually live
(`affineSubspaceExtensor_mem_exteriorPower`) — rather than a coordinate vector in `ℝ^D`;
`span C(p(e))` is then literally a `Submodule` of it and the hinge constraint is a
membership. The concrete `⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` identification is realized as the `finrank`
equality `screwSpace_finrank : finrank ℝ (ScrewSpace k) = D` (rather than an explicit
basis), the numeric gate for the rank counts of `lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound` and the
degree of freedom of `def:dof-generic`.

Carrier for the multigraph: mathlib core `Graph α β` (the Phase 13–16 carrier).
Carrier for points: `Fin (k+1) → ℝ`, matching Phase 17's `affineSubspaceExtensor`.

body-hinge rigidity: the dimension of the screw-center space `ScrewSpace k`, equal to the

/-- The **screw-center space** of `d = k+1`-dimensional body-hinge rigidity: the degree-`k`
graded piece `⋀[ℝ]^k (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)` of the exterior algebra, in which the supporting
extensors `C(·) = affineSubspaceExtensor` of the hinges live
(`affineSubspaceExtensor_mem_exteriorPower`). An infinitesimal motion of a rigid body is a
`D`-dimensional *screw center* `S(v)` in this space, `D = screwDim k = (k+2 choose 2)`
(`screwSpace_finrank`). We carry the screw center as the graded-piece element (a `Submodule`
of the full exterior algebra) rather than a coordinate vector in `ℝ^D`, so `span C(p(e))` is
literally a `Submodule` of it (`def:hinge-constraint`); the `⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` identification
of the blueprint is realized by the `finrank` equality `screwSpace_finrank` rather than an
explicit basis. -/

/-- **The screw-center space has dimension `D = (k+2 choose 2)`** (`def:rigidity-matrix`,
the deferred `⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` coordinatization). Since `ScrewSpace k` is the degree-`k`
graded piece of the exterior algebra of `ℝ^(k+2)`, its dimension is `(k+2).choose k`
(`exteriorPower.finrank_eq`), which equals `(k+2).choose 2 = screwDim k` by the symmetry
`binom(n, j) = binom(n, n-j)`. This is the numeric content of the blueprint's
`⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` identification — carried as a `finrank` equality rather than an explicit
basis — and is the gate for every numeric rank count (`lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound`'s

`D`-dimensional screw space can have at most `m ≤ D` hinges, the upper half `|V| ≤ D` of
Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 5.4's hypothesis `3 ≤ |V| ≤ D` (`lem:cycle-realization`). Immediate from

/-- A **`d = k+1`-dimensional body-hinge framework** `(G,p)` (`def:hinge-constraint`):
a multigraph `G : Graph α β` together with, for each edge `e : β`, its supporting
`(d-1) = k`-extensor `C(p(e)) = supportExtensor e ∈ ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` — the screw-space
element the rigidity matrix constrains. In the affine model `p(e)` is a
`(d-2) = (k-1)`-dimensional affine *hinge* subspace spanned by `k` points of `ℝ^(k+1)`
and `C(p(e)) = affineSubspaceExtensor (p e)` (Phase 17, the smart constructor `ofHinge`);
the panel model (Phase 21, `PanelHingeFramework.toBodyHinge`) supplies it as a
Grassmann–Cayley meet of two panels instead. Carrying the support extensor directly as a
field decouples the rigidity-matrix rank theory from how the extensor arose, so both the
affine hinge and the panel hinge feed the same constraint family.

The dimension is reparametrized `d = k + 1` (so points live in `ℝ^(k+1)`,
homogenizing to `ℝ^(k+2)`) to clear the `ℕ`-subtractions `d-1`, `d-2` that the
hinge / extensor arities would otherwise carry, matching the Phase 17
`omitTwoExtensor` reparametrization. -/

`S u - S v ∈ span C(p(e)) = Submodule.span ℝ {C(p(e))}`.

/-- The **hinge-row block** `r(p(e))` at an edge `e` (`def:hinge-row-block`): the
orthogonal complement `(span C(p(e)))^⊥` of the hinge's supporting extensor, taken
basis-free as the **dual annihilator** of `span C(p(e))` inside the dual space
`Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)`. Its elements are the row functionals `r_i(p(e))`; a
basis of it is the `(D-1)` rows of Katoh–Tanigawa's `(D-1) × D` matrix `r(p(e))`
(`D = (k+2 choose 2) = dim (ScrewSpace k)`, and `span C(p(e))` is `1`-dimensional
when the hinge is genuine, so its annihilator has dimension `D - 1`).

Carrying the orthogonal complement as the annihilator submodule keeps the screw
space as the graded-piece element (`def:hinge-constraint`): no explicit
`⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` coordinate basis / inner-product structure is forced at this
node. The dot products `(S u - S v) · r_i(p(e))` of the blueprint become the
functional applications `r (S u - S v)`, and the orthogonality `v ⟂ span C ↔ r v = 0
∀ r ∈ (span C)^⊥` is exactly the field-level double-annihilator identity
`Subspace.dualAnnihilator_dualCoannihilator_eq`. -/

screw assignment `S` meets the hinge constraint at `e = uv` (`def:hinge-constraint`)
exactly when the relative screw center `S u - S v` is annihilated by every row
functional `r ∈ r(p(e))` of the hinge-row block, i.e. `r (S u - S v) = 0` for all
`r ∈ F.hingeRowBlock e`. This is Katoh–Tanigawa's restatement
`(S(u) - S(v)) · r_i(p(e)) = 0`, `1 ≤ i ≤ D-1`.

The forward direction is `Submodule.dualAnnihilator` membership; the converse is the
field-level double-annihilator identity `Subspace.dualAnnihilator_dualCoannihilator_eq`
(`(span C)^⊥⊥ = span C`), which holds because `ScrewSpace k` is an `ℝ`-vector
space. -/

for a row `r` of the hinge-row block (`def:hinge-row-block`) at an oriented edge `e = uv`. This is
the coordinatized view of one row of `R(G,p)`: the block row of the oriented edge `e = uv` carries
the dual element `r` in `u`'s `D` columns and `−r` in `v`'s, zero elsewhere, so its dot product
with `S` is exactly `r (S u − S v)`. Built basis-free as `r ∘ₗ screwDiff u v` — the composite of
the relative-screw evaluation `screwDiff` with the hinge-row-block functional `r ∈ Module.Dual ℝ
(ScrewSpace k)` — so that the rigidity matrix is carried as the *family* of these functionals
(`rigidityRows`) and its null space `Z(G,p)` is their common kernel
(`infinitesimalMotions_eq_dualCoannihilator`). It depends only on the endpoints `u v` and the row
`r`, not on which edge `e` carries the hinge; the edge is recorded only at the family level
(`rigidityRows`, which pairs `u v` with the rows of the edge's hinge-row block). -/

surjective. Any target screw `x` is hit by the assignment placing `x` on `u` and `0` elsewhere
(`Function.update 0 u x`): at `u` it reads `x`, at the distinct `v` it reads `0`, so
`S u − S v = x`. This is the dual of the row-functional injectivity `hingeRow` carries
(`hingeRow_eq_dualMap`): a
genuine edge `e = uv` (distinct endpoints) reads every relative screw, so its block of rows
faithfully sees the whole hinge-row block. -/

`linearIndependent_hingeRow` route through the dual-map injectivity
`LinearMap.dualMap_injective_of_surjective`. -/

/-- **The independence bridge: independent hinge-row functionals stay independent as rigidity rows**
(`def:rigidity-matrix`, the Case-I `hindep` brick). For a genuine edge `e = uv` with distinct
endpoints, if a family `r : ι → Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)` of hinge-row-block functionals is
linearly independent, then so is the family of rigidity rows `i ↦ hingeRow u v (r i)` it induces on
the screw-assignment space `α → ScrewSpace k`. Because `screwDiff u v` is surjective at distinct
bodies (`screwDiff_surjective`), its dual map `(screwDiff u v).dualMap = hingeRow u v`
(`hingeRow_eq_dualMap`) is injective (`LinearMap.dualMap_injective_of_surjective`), and an injective
linear map preserves linear independence (`LinearIndependent.map'`).

This turns the independent supporting extensors of a rigid block
(`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`, through the `(D−1)`-dimensional hinge-row block
`finrank_hingeRowBlock`) into the independent rigidity-row subfamily the Case-I capstone
`hglue_of_realization` needs (`hindep`): one transversal hinge `e = uv` contributes `D − 1`
independent rows of `R(G,p)`, all routed through the *same* relative-screw evaluation, so block-row
independence is exactly hinge-row-block independence. -/

hinge-row block `r(p(e))` (`def:hinge-row-block`). This is the basis-free carrier of `R(G,p)` as
a *family of functionals* on the screw-assignment space `α → ScrewSpace k` — its span is the row
space of the matrix and its common kernel (the dual coannihilator of that span) is the null space
`Z(G,p) = infinitesimalMotions` (`infinitesimalMotions_eq_dualCoannihilator`). Carrying the matrix
this way (rather than as an explicit `(D−1)|E| × D|V|` real coordinate matrix) keeps the screw
space the graded-piece element and lets the rank arguments run through `Module.Dual`; it is the
view the Phase-21b genericity device parametrizes by the panel coordinates. -/

hinge constraint (`def:hinge-constraint`) at *every* edge of `G`, i.e. for every edge `e`
linking endpoints `u v` (`G.IsLink e u v`), the relative screw center `S u - S v` lies in
`span C(p(e))`.

This is membership in the kernel of Katoh–Tanigawa's rigidity matrix `R(G,p)`

hinge-row block `r(p(e))` in the `D` columns of `u` and `-r(p(e))` in those of `v` (zero
elsewhere), so a vanishing matrix-vector product is exactly the per-edge hinge constraint.

constraint `hingeConstraint_iff_hingeRowBlock` (`r (S u − S v) = 0` for all `r ∈ r(p(e))`). This is

/-- **A finite family of rows spans the rigidity row space** (`def:rigidity-matrix`,
the genericity device's finite-index input): when the body set `α` is finite, the screw-
assignment space `α → ScrewSpace k` is finite-dimensional (`finrank_screwAssignment`), hence so
is its dual `Module.Dual ℝ (α → ScrewSpace k)` (`Subspace.instModuleDualFiniteDimensional`), and
therefore every submodule of it is finitely generated — in particular `span ℝ F.rigidityRows`. So
there is a *finite* family `a : Fin n → Module.Dual ℝ (α → ScrewSpace k)` with the same span as
the (a priori infinite) row set `rigidityRows`,
`span ℝ (range a) = span ℝ F.rigidityRows` (`Submodule.fg_iff_exists_fin_generating_family`).

This supplies the finite-index spanning family `a` (with `hspanrows`) that the Phase-21b
genericity device's consumer-facing capstone `hglue_of_realization` requires of each consumer: the
device's engine needs a finite index type, and the constant-path route reads the corank off this
family at the single hand-built realization `F`. The remaining Case-I inputs (the matching-size
independent subfamily) come from `exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor` through the hinge-row
block. -/

/-- **A single transversal hinge contributes `D − 1` independent rigidity rows**
(`def:rigidity-matrix`, the per-edge half of the Case-I `hindep`/`hmatch` assembly). For a genuine
edge `e = uv` with distinct endpoints (`u ≠ v`) whose supporting extensor is nonzero (the
transversal / general-position hinge, `panelSupportExtensor_ne_zero_iff`), there is a linearly
independent family of `D − 1 = screwDim k − 1` rigidity rows, all members of `F.rigidityRows`.
The family is `hingeRow u v` applied to a basis of the hinge-row block: the `(D−1)`-dimensional
hinge-row block `r(p(e))` (`finrank_hingeRowBlock`) has a basis of `D − 1` functionals, supplied
in ambient-coerced existence form by `Submodule.exists_linearIndependent_fin_of_finrank_eq` (so
the heavy `Module.Dual` of an exterior power is never unfolded). Each basis functional lies in
`r(p(e))`, so its `hingeRow u v` image is a rigidity row (witnessed by `e, u, v`), and the
basis-independent functionals stay independent as rigidity rows through the relative-screw
evaluation (`linearIndependent_hingeRow`). This is the per-edge brick that counts and produces the
matching-size independent rigidity-row subfamily the Case-I capstone `hglue_of_realization` needs:
each transversal hinge of a rigid block contributes exactly `D − 1` independent rows of `R(G,p)`,
all routed through the same `screwDiff u v`. -/

/-- **The star independence bridge: rows from distinct hinges at a common body are jointly
independent** (`def:rigidity-matrix`, the Case-I cross-hinge `hindep` step). Fix a body `v` and a
family of distinct other endpoints `w : J → α` (`hw` injective, `hwv` each `w j ≠ v`) — a *star*
of edges all incident to `v`, the shape a rigid block pinned at `v` presents. If for each `j : J`
the hinge-row functionals `r j : Iⱼ → Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)` are linearly independent, then
the combined rigidity-row family `⟨j, i⟩ ↦ hingeRow (w j) v (r j i)` over the disjoint union
`Σ j, Iⱼ` is linearly independent on `α → ScrewSpace k`.

This is the cross-hinge step the per-edge brick `exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_edge` does not
cover: rows from *different* hinges go through *different* relative-screw evaluations
`screwDiff (w j) v`, so `linearIndependent_hingeRow`'s single-edge dual-map argument no longer
applies. The independence is instead the *pin-a-body* / disjoint-support count: evaluating a
vanishing combination at the screw assignment `Function.update 0 (w k) x` (place `x` on the body
`w k`, `0` elsewhere — legitimate since `w k ≠ v` and the `w j` are distinct) collapses it to
`∑ i, c⟨k,i⟩ • (r k i) x = 0` for all `x`, so per-hinge independence
(`Fintype.linearIndependent_iff` on `r k`) forces every coefficient at `k` to vanish. This is the
joint independence of the rigid block's hinge rows that `hglue_of_realization`'s `hindep` consumes
— each of the block's transversal hinges contributing its `D − 1` rows
(`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_edge`), the rows of distinct hinges jointly independent because
they live on disjoint body-coordinate blocks once the common body is pinned. -/

/-- **Cross-hinge independence over a rigid block of edges spanning many bodies**
(`def:rigidity-matrix`, the Case-I `hindep` step in its general form). The multi-body
generalization of `linearIndependent_hingeRow_star`: where the star fixes one common body `v`,
here each hinge `j : J` is oriented from a *private endpoint* `u j` — the "child" vertex of a
spanning forest of the rigid block, so the `u j` are distinct (`hu` injective) — to an arbitrary
*other endpoint* `other j`, subject only to the **forest separation** hypothesis `hsep`: no
other-endpoint of any hinge is the private endpoint of any hinge (`other j ≠ u j'` for all
`j, j'`; in particular `u j ≠ other j`). If for each `j` the hinge-row functionals
`r j : Iⱼ → Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)` are linearly independent, the combined rigidity-row
family `⟨j, i⟩ ↦ hingeRow (u j) (other j) (r j i)` over `Σ j, Iⱼ` is linearly independent on
`α → ScrewSpace k`.

This is the cross-hinge step a genuine rigid block — a spanning tree / forest of the contracted
block, hinges spanning *multiple* bodies rather than a single pinned `v` — presents to
`hglue_of_realization`'s `hindep`. The star (`linearIndependent_hingeRow_star`) is the special
case `u = w`, `other = const v`: there `hsep` is `w j' ≠ v`, here it is the forest property that
each hinge has a private child vertex incident to no other hinge of the block. The proof is the
same *pin-a-body* / disjoint-support count, pinning the private endpoint `u j₀` rather than the
common body: evaluating a vanishing combination at the screw assignment `Function.update 0 (u j₀)
x` reads `0` on every hinge `j ≠ j₀` (its private endpoint `u j ≠ u j₀` by injectivity, its other
endpoint `other j ≠ u j₀` by `hsep`) and `x` on hinge `j₀` (its other endpoint `other j₀ ≠ u j₀`
again by `hsep`), collapsing to `∑ i, c⟨j₀,i⟩ • (r j₀ i) x = 0` for all `x`, so per-hinge
independence forces every coefficient at `j₀` to vanish. -/

/-- **A rigid block's spanning forest of transversal hinges yields `(D−1)·|J|` independent
rigidity rows** (`def:rigidity-matrix`, the Case-I `hindep`/`hmatch` assembly in its general form).
This is the multi-body assembly the hand-off flagged: it combines the per-edge brick
`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_edge` (each transversal hinge contributing `D − 1 = screwDim
k − 1` independent rows through the same relative-screw evaluation `screwDiff (u j) (other j)`) with
the cross-hinge combination `linearIndependent_hingeRow_forest` (rows of *distinct* hinges jointly
independent by the pin-a-body count over the spanning forest).

Concretely, for a family of hinges `j : J` of a rigid block oriented along a spanning forest — each
edge `e j` linking a *private endpoint* `u j` (the forest child, so `u` injective) to an arbitrary
`other j`, with the forest-separation hypothesis `hsep : ∀ j j', other j ≠ u j'` and every hinge
transversal (`he : F.supportExtensor (e j) ≠ 0`) — there is a linearly independent family of
rigidity rows indexed by the disjoint union `Σ j, Fin (screwDim k − 1)`, all members of
`F.rigidityRows`. The index type has cardinality `|J|·(screwDim k − 1)` (`Nat.card_sigma`), so this
is the matching-size independent subfamily `s` the Case-I capstone `hglue_of_realization` consumes:
its `hindep` is the joint independence and its `hmatch` count is `|J|·(D − 1)`, matched against the
contraction's inductive rank. The per-edge block functionals `c j` (a basis of the
`(D−1)`-dimensional hinge-row block `r(p(e j))`, `finrank_hingeRowBlock`) are extracted by
`exists_linearIndependent_fin_of_finrank_eq`, fed to `linearIndependent_hingeRow_forest` for the
joint independence, and witnessed as rigidity rows via the link `hlink j` and block membership. -/

and the screw-dimension count `screwSpace_finrank` (the `⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` coordinatization of
`def:rigidity-matrix`). With `finrank_trivialMotions` this gives the numeric rank bound
`rank R(G,p) ≤ D|V| - D = D(|V|-1)` of `lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound` (the codimension of the
`D`-dimensional trivial kernel) and the degree of freedom of `def:dof-generic`. -/

/-- **Two general-position parallel hinges intersect their constraint spans only at `0`**
(`lem:rank-parallel-full`, Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 5.3, span form): if the supporting extensors
`C₁, C₂` of two hinges are linearly independent (the *general-position* hypothesis), then the
two one-dimensional constraint spans `span C₁` and `span C₂` meet only at the origin,
`span C₁ ⊓ span C₂ = ⊥`. This is the linear-algebra core of the lemma; the geometric
general-position hypothesis on the hinge points is `affineSubspaceExtensor`-independence,
supplied by the extensor-independence engine (`omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent`,
Phase 17 Lemma 2.1) specialized to two hinges. -/

/-- **Two general-position parallel hinges force the relative screw to zero**
(`lem:rank-parallel-full`, Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 5.3): if two edges `e₁, e₂` of a body-hinge
framework `F` join the same pair of bodies `u, v` with hinges in general position — i.e. their
supporting extensors `C(p(e₁)), C(p(e₂))` are linearly independent — then any screw assignment
`S` satisfying the hinge constraint of *both* edges has equal screw centers on the two bodies,
`S u = S v`. Geometrically the two `(D-1) × D` hinge-row blocks together have full rank `D`
(`hingeRowBlock`), so the combined kernel on the relative screw `S u - S v` is `{0}`: this is
the base case `|V| = 2` of the conjecture's algebraic induction. The general-position
hypothesis on the hinge *points* is supplied by `omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent`
(Phase 17 Lemma 2.1) specialized to the two hinges. -/

/-- **An independent family of constraint spans admits no nonzero cycle of differences**
(`lem:cycle-realization`, the linear-algebra core of the `m`-body cycle): if `c : Fin m →
ScrewSpace k` is linearly independent and a family `d : Fin m → ScrewSpace k` has each
`d i ∈ span {c i}` with `∑ i, d i = 0`, then every `d i = 0`. This is the screw-space fact
behind Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 5.4 for a cycle of length `m`: around a cycle the relative-screw
differences `d i = S(vᵢ) − S(vᵢ₊₁)` lie in the one-dimensional hinge spans `span C(p(eᵢ))`
and telescope to `∑ d i = 0`, so independence of the `m` supporting extensors forces every
difference to vanish — the `m`-edge generalization of
`span_inf_span_eq_bot_of_linearIndependent` (the `m = 2` antiparallel case). Each `d i` is a
scalar multiple `aᵢ • c i` (`Submodule.mem_span_singleton`), and `∑ aᵢ • c i = 0` with the
`c i` independent forces every `aᵢ = 0` (`Fintype.linearIndependent_iff`). -/

/-- The **pinned-motion subspace** at a body `v` (`lem:rank-delete-vertex`): the infinitesimal
motions `S` that vanish on the pinned body, `S v = 0`. Pinning a body — fixing it to the zero
screw — is the algebraic effect of deleting the `D` columns of `v` from the rigidity matrix
`R(G,p)`; the surviving motions are exactly this subspace. Carried as the submodule of

/-- **Every infinitesimal motion splits as trivial plus pinned** (`lem:rank-delete-vertex`):
`trivialMotions ⊔ pinnedMotions v = infinitesimalMotions`. Any motion `S` is the sum of the
trivial motion `fun _ => S v` (constant at the pinned body's screw) and the pinned motion
`fun u => S u - S v` (which vanishes at `v` and is still a motion by
`isInfinitesimalMotion_sub_const`). With
`trivialMotions_inf_pinnedMotions_eq_bot` this exhibits `Z(G,p)` as the internal direct sum of
the `D` trivial motions and the body-`v`-pinned motions. -/

/-- **Pinning one body preserves rank** (`lem:rank-delete-vertex`, Katoh--Tanigawa Lemma 5.1):
deleting the `D` columns of a single body `v` from the rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` drops exactly the
`D` trivial-motion dimensions, leaving the rank unchanged. In the codimension form: the null
space `Z(G,p)` is the internal direct sum of the `D`-dimensional trivial motions and the
body-`v`-pinned motions, so

  `finrank (pinnedMotions v) + D = finrank Z(G,p)`,

equivalently `rank R(G,p) = rank R(G,p; V ∖ v)`. The `D` trivial motions
(`lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound`) normalize any motion to vanish on the pinned body
(`isInfinitesimalMotion_sub_const`), the pin-a-body motion-space fact of
White--Whiteley~`whiteWhiteley1987`. -/

/-- **Refining the hinge spans shrinks the motion space** (`lem:rank-rotation-semicont`,
Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 5.2, span/monotonicity form). If two body-hinge frameworks `F`, `F'`
share the same underlying multigraph and at every edge the constraint span of `F` is contained
in that of `F'` — i.e. `F'` is the *more general* (more constrained) realization, the generic
member of a rotation family — then every infinitesimal motion of `F'` is one of `F`:
`F'.infinitesimalMotions ≤ F.infinitesimalMotions`. The stronger (larger-span) constraints of
`F'` cut out a smaller null space.

This is the basis-free core of the lower-semicontinuity of `rank R(G,p)`: along a one-parameter
family rotating a panel, the generic realization has the *largest* supporting spans (the hinge
points in general position), hence the *smallest* motion space and the *largest* rank
(`finrank_infinitesimalMotions_le_of_span_le`). We carry it as this monotonicity-under-span-
refinement statement — matching the basis-free treatment of Lemmas 5.1/5.3 — rather than the
literal analytic one-parameter semicontinuity, which would force the parametrized
polynomial-entry coordinate matrix the design defers (the genericity-over-perturbation choice of
the risk register). -/

/-- **Rank is lower-semicontinuous under hinge-span refinement** (`lem:rank-rotation-semicont`,
Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 5.2, rank form). If `F'` refines `F` — same graph, every constraint span
of `F` contained in that of `F'` — then the motion space of `F'` has no larger dimension than
that of `F`:

  `finrank Z(G, p') ≤ finrank Z(G, p)`,

equivalently `rank R(G, p) ≤ rank R(G, p')` (the rank is the codimension `D|V| − finrank Z` and
`finrank Z` only shrinks under refinement, `finrank_screwAssignment`). So the *generic* member of
a one-parameter rotation family — the one whose hinges are in general position, with the largest
supporting spans — attains the maximum rank, the content of Katoh–Tanigawa's Lemma 5.2: rank
cannot drop at a generic parameter. Immediate from the span-monotonicity
`infinitesimalMotions_mono_of_span_le` and `Submodule.finrank_mono`. -/
