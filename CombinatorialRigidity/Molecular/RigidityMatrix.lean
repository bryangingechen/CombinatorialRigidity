# The panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` (`sec:molecular-rigidity-matrix`)

Phase 18, the second phase of the molecular-conjecture program (Phases 17–26; see
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). Where the body-hinge chapter (Phase 16,
`BodyBar/BodyHinge.lean`) *defined* rigidity by reduction to body-bar on the
multiplied graph `(δ-1)·G` (a standard-basis witness, no honest geometry — the
*existence* form), this file builds the **genuine** panel-hinge / body-hinge
rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` of Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 (*A proof of the molecular
conjecture*, Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, §2.2–2.4), on a realization `p`
assigning a `(d-2)`-dimensional affine *hinge* subspace to each edge.

This file lands the `sec:molecular-rigidity-matrix` dep-graph in dependency order.
The leaf node landing here:

* `BodyHingeFramework` (`def:hinge-constraint`) — a `d`-dimensional body-hinge
  framework `(G,p)` is a multigraph `G : Graph α β` together with a map `p`
  assigning each edge a *hinge*: a `(d-1)`-point family in `ℝ^d` whose affine span
  is a `(d-2)`-dimensional affine subspace. Reparametrizing `d = k+1` to clear the
  `ℕ`-subtraction, a hinge is `Fin k → Fin (k+1) → ℝ` (`k` points in `ℝ^(k+1)`),
  homogenizing to `ℝ^(k+2)`; its supporting `(d-1)`-extensor is the `k`-extensor
  `C(p(e)) = affineSubspaceExtensor (p e) ∈ ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` of Phase 17.
* `hingeConstraint` (`def:hinge-constraint`) — identifying an infinitesimal motion
  of a rigid body with a `D`-dimensional *screw center* `S(v)` living in the
  exterior algebra `ExteriorAlgebra ℝ (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)` (where `C(p(e))` lives), the
  hinge `p(e)` constrains the two screw centers `S(u), S(v)` of its endpoints
  `e = uv` to satisfy
  `S(u) - S(v) ∈ span C(p(e)) = Submodule.span ℝ {affineSubspaceExtensor (p e)}`.

## Carrier and dimension

Infinitesimal motions are `D`-dimensional screw centers with `D = (d+1 choose 2)`,
matching Phase 17's extensor space `⋀^(d-1) ℝ^(d+1) ≅ ℝ^D` (here, with `d = k+1`,
`⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)`). We carry the screw center as an element of the **degree-`k` graded
piece** `⋀[ℝ]^k (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)` of the exterior algebra — the subspace in which the
supporting extensors `C(p(e)) = affineSubspaceExtensor (p e)` actually live
(`affineSubspaceExtensor_mem_exteriorPower`) — rather than a coordinate vector in `ℝ^D`;
`span C(p(e))` is then literally a `Submodule` of it and the hinge constraint is a
membership. The concrete `⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` identification is realized as the `finrank`
equality `screwSpace_finrank : finrank ℝ (ScrewSpace k) = D` (rather than an explicit
basis), the numeric gate for the rank counts of `lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound` and the
degree of freedom of `def:dof-generic`.

Carrier for the multigraph: mathlib core `Graph α β` (the Phase 13–16 carrier).
Carrier for points: `Fin (k+1) → ℝ`, matching Phase 17's `affineSubspaceExtensor`.

/-- The **screw dimension** `D = (d+1 choose 2) = (k+2 choose 2)` of `d = k+1`-dimensional
body-hinge rigidity: the dimension of the screw-center space `ScrewSpace k`, equal to the
dimension `binom(d+1, 2)` of the space of infinitesimal screw motions of a rigid body in
`ℝ^d` (Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §2.2). -/

/-- The **screw-center space** of `d = k+1`-dimensional body-hinge rigidity: the degree-`k`
graded piece `⋀[ℝ]^k (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)` of the exterior algebra, in which the supporting
extensors `C(·) = affineSubspaceExtensor` of the hinges live
(`affineSubspaceExtensor_mem_exteriorPower`). An infinitesimal motion of a rigid body is a
`D`-dimensional *screw center* `S(v)` in this space, `D = screwDim k = (k+2 choose 2)`
(`screwSpace_finrank`). We carry the screw center as the graded-piece element (a `Submodule`
of the full exterior algebra) rather than a coordinate vector in `ℝ^D`, so `span C(p(e))` is
literally a `Submodule` of it (`def:hinge-constraint`); the `⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` identification
of the blueprint is realized by the `finrank` equality `screwSpace_finrank` rather than an
explicit basis. -/

/-- **The screw-center space has dimension `D = (k+2 choose 2)`** (`def:rigidity-matrix`,
the deferred `⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` coordinatization). Since `ScrewSpace k` is the degree-`k`
graded piece of the exterior algebra of `ℝ^(k+2)`, its dimension is `(k+2).choose k`
(`exteriorPower.finrank_eq`), which equals `(k+2).choose 2 = screwDim k` by the symmetry
`binom(n, j) = binom(n, n-j)`. This is the numeric content of the blueprint's
`⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` identification — carried as a `finrank` equality rather than an explicit
basis — and is the gate for every numeric rank count (`lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound`'s
`rank R ≤ D(|V|-1)`, the degree of freedom of `def:dof-generic`). -/

independent family of `m` screw-space elements has `m ≤ D = screwDim k`, since
`ScrewSpace k` is `D`-dimensional (`screwSpace_finrank`). This is the dimension bound a panel
*cycle* must respect — a cycle whose `m` supporting extensors are independent in the
`D`-dimensional screw space can have at most `m ≤ D` hinges, the upper half `|V| ≤ D` of
Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 5.4's hypothesis `3 ≤ |V| ≤ D` (`lem:cycle-realization`). Immediate from
the finite-dimensionality bound `LinearIndependent.fintype_card_le_finrank`. -/

`ScrewSpace 2`** (`lem:case-III-claim612-extensor-span`, Katoh–Tanigawa eq. (6.45) via Lemma 2.1).
At `d = 3` (`D = 6`, `ScrewSpace 2 = ⋀²ℝ⁴`, `finrank = 6`), for four linearly-independent
homogeneous vectors `pbar : Fin 4 → ℝ⁴` the `binom(4,2) = 6` panel-support `2`-extensors
`omitTwoExtensor pbar`
— one per pair, the join `pᵢ ∨ pⱼ` of the line through each pair — span all of
`⋀²ℝ⁴ = ScrewSpace 2`. By Lemma 2.1 (`omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent_of_li` at `e = 2`) the six
are linearly independent in the `6`-dimensional `ScrewSpace 2`, and a linearly independent family of
`6 = finrank ℝ (ScrewSpace 2)` vectors is a basis, hence spans. This is the spanning input to the
Claim-6.12 contrapositive (`lem:case-III-claim612`): a single nonzero `r ∈ ScrewSpace 2`
annihilating every supporting extensor in the union (6.45) is forced to be `0`. The bare-LI
hypothesis is what the `d = 3` producer feeds directly (`exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals`),
sparing the de-homogenization to affine points (`notes/Phase22-realization-design.md` §1.42). -/

/-- **A functional annihilating a spanning set is zero** (`lem:case-III-claim612-orthseq-vanish`,
the Claim-6.12 contrapositive's non-degeneracy step). If a screw-space functional
`r : Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)` vanishes on every element of a set `S` whose span is all of
`ScrewSpace k`, then `r = 0`. Two linear maps agreeing on a spanning set are equal
(`LinearMap.ext_on`); `r` agrees with the zero functional on `S` and `span S = ⊤`, so `r = 0` — the
non-degeneracy of the dual pairing on `ℝ^D`. This is
the final step of the Claim-6.12 contrapositive (`lem:case-III-claim612`): the common vector `r` is
orthogonal to every supporting extensor in KT's union (6.45), which the six panel-support extensors
of four affinely-independent points force to span `ScrewSpace 2` (`span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top`), so
`r = 0`, contradicting `r ≠ 0`. -/

/-- **The intersection of `< d+1` panel hyperplanes in `ℝ^(d+1)` is nonempty as a projective
locus** (`lem:case-III-claim612-points-affineIndep`, the existence half of KT eq. (6.45)'s point
choice; the `j`-hyperplane intersection brick). Given a family `n : Fin m → (Fin (d+1) → ℝ)` of
`m` panel normals with `m < d + 1`, the homogeneous incidence system `⟨p̄, n i⟩ = 0` for all `i`
has a *nonzero* solution `p̄ : Fin (d+1) → ℝ`: the `m × (d+1)` coefficient matrix has strictly more
columns than rows, so its null space is nontrivial. This is the geometric existence step behind
KT's "for any `j` of the hyperplanes their intersection forms a `(d-j)`-dimensional affine space"
(p. 698, eq. (6.67)): with `m = j` panels, the homogeneous (projective) solution set is a genuine
`(d+1-j)`-dimensional subspace, hence nonempty, so a representative homogeneous point exists on
every one of the chosen panels. (The *affine independence* of the four chosen points — that they
span an affine `3`-simplex at `d = 3` — is the genericity content of the full
`lem:case-III-claim612-points-affineIndep`, still red: it needs the affine-independence determinant
nonvanishing from the algebraic independence of the panel coefficients, `lem:genericity-device`.) -/

/-- **The product-route producer for generic affine independence**
(`lem:case-III-claim612-points-affineIndep`, the genericity-to-realization closure half). Suppose
the `d + 1` candidate points are built as functions `p : (σ → ℝ) → Fin (d+1) → Fin d → ℝ` of a
panel-coordinate seed `q : σ → ℝ`, and their affine-independence determinant — the homogenization
determinant `det (homogenize ∘ (p q)) : ℝ` of `affineIndependent_fin_iff_det_homogenize` — is the
evaluation of a *nonzero* multivariate polynomial `P : MvPolynomial σ ℝ` in `q` (`hdet`). Then there
is a seed `q` at which the points `p q` are **affinely independent**.

This is the genericity-free *closure* step: it composes the device's foundational non-root brick
`MvPolynomial.exists_eval_ne_zero` (over the infinite field `ℝ`, a nonzero polynomial does not
vanish identically; the same brick Case I uses to pick a shared seed) with the determinant
characterization `affineIndependent_fin_iff_det_homogenize` (Lemma 2.1, top-extensor form). It
carries the genericity *content* as the hypothesis `hdet` — that the affine-independence
determinant, as a function of the seed, is a nonzero polynomial — which is the irreducible
genericity remainder of N3a (KT p. 691/698, `lem:genericity-device`: the determinant is nonzero
because the panel coefficients are algebraically independent over `ℚ`). Parallel to the existence
half `exists_ne_zero_dotProduct_eq_zero`, this isolates the genuinely genericity-bearing fact
(`P ≠ 0`) from the surrounding linear-algebra glue. -/

/-- **The affine-independence determinant of polynomial-valued candidate points is a polynomial in
the seed** (`lem:case-III-claim612-points-affineIndep`, the determinant-polynomial bridge feeding
the closure half). Suppose the `d + 1` candidate points are built coordinate-by-coordinate as
multivariate polynomials in the panel-coordinate seed: a family `pp : Fin (d+1) → Fin d →
MvPolynomial σ ℝ`, with the point `p q i := fun j => eval q (pp i j)`. Then their
affine-independence determinant — the homogenization determinant
`det (homogenize ∘ (p q)) : ℝ` of `affineIndependent_fin_iff_det_homogenize` — is the evaluation at
`q` of a *single* polynomial `P : MvPolynomial σ ℝ`, namely the determinant of the
`(d+1) × (d+1)` polynomial matrix whose rows are the homogenized polynomial points
`Fin.snoc (pp i) 1`.

This discharges the `hdet` hypothesis of the closure producer
`exists_affineIndependent_of_det_polynomial_ne_zero`: the ring homomorphism `eval q` commutes with
`det` (`RingHom.map_det`) and with `Fin.snoc · 1` (it sends the constant final coordinate `1` to
`1`), so evaluating the polynomial determinant at `q` reproduces the real homogenization determinant
of the evaluated points. It isolates the *polynomial-in-the-seed* structure of the determinant from
the genuinely genericity-bearing fact that this polynomial is nonzero (`P ≠ 0`, the irreducible
remainder of N3a, the genericity device `lem:genericity-device`), exactly as the existence half
`exists_ne_zero_dotProduct_eq_zero` and the closure half
`exists_affineIndependent_of_det_polynomial_ne_zero` isolate their own ingredients. -/

/-- **The explicit good seed: four affinely-independent points realizing the
`Π(a)/Π(b)/Π(c)` incidence pattern** (`lem:case-III-claim612-points-affineIndep`, the `P ≠ 0`
existence witness; KT eq. (6.45) point choice). At `d = 3` there exist three panel normals
`n : Fin 3 → ℝ⁴` in *nonparallel* position (`LinearIndependent`) and four **affinely-independent**
points `p : Fin 4 → ℝ³` realizing the triple-intersection incidence pattern of KT eq. (6.45):
`p 0 ∈ Π(a) ∩ Π(b) ∩ Π(c)`, `p 1 ∈ Π(a) ∩ Π(b) ∖ Π(c)`, `p 2 ∈ Π(b) ∩ Π(c) ∖ Π(a)`,
`p 3 ∈ Π(c) ∩ Π(a) ∖ Π(b)`, where panel incidence `p i ∈ Π(u) ⟺ ⟨homogenize (p i), n u⟩ = 0`
(the `⬝ᵥ` of the homogenization with the panel normal).

This is the **existence-route residual** of `lem:case-III-claim612-points-affineIndep`: by the
converse of `MvPolynomial.exists_eval_ne_zero` (the foundational non-root brick the closure half
`exists_affineIndependent_of_det_polynomial_ne_zero` runs forward) and the determinant-polynomial
bridge `exists_detPolynomial_of_pointPolynomial`, the residual `P ≠ 0` of the cross-product
construction (the affine-independence determinant as a polynomial in the panel-coordinate seed) is
*logically equivalent* to exhibiting **one** seed at which the constructed points are affinely
independent — no algebraic independence of the seed is needed, exactly the existence/Zariski route
the pre-Phase-22d genericity sites (Claim 6.4/6.9) used. Here the witness is the coordinate-aligned
seed: panel normals `n_a = e₀`, `n_b = e₁`, `n_c = e₂` (the first three standard covectors of `ℝ⁴`,
hence linearly independent — the nonparallel hypothesis the framework supplies) and the standard
affine `3`-simplex `p = (0, e₃, e₁, e₂)` of `ℝ³` (origin plus three axis points). The incidence
pattern is then immediate from the coordinates: `homogenize (p i)` is orthogonal to exactly the
panel normals whose coordinate it vanishes at, and the `4 × 4` homogenization determinant is
`±1 ≠ 0` (`affineIndependent_fin_iff_det_homogenize` via the explicit `Matrix.det_succ_row_zero`
cofactor expansion). -/

glue; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1 eq. (6.45), Phase 22g). For the four affinely-independent points
`p : Fin 4 → ℝ³` of `exists_affineIndependent_panel_incidence` (N3a) and a join
`q : {q // q.1 < q.2}` (the omitted pair), the spanning join
`omitTwoExtensor (homogenize ∘ p) (ne_of_lt q.2)` — the `2`-extensor of the two points **kept** by
the omit-two operation — is the point-join `extensor ![homogenize (p c), homogenize (p d)]` of the

/-- **A second panel normal through a line in `ℝ⁴`** (`lem:case-III-claim612`, N3a/N3b glue;
Phase 22g). Given two points `pi, pj : Fin 4 → ℝ` of a line `L = pi pj` and one normal `n_u`
to which both are dot-orthogonal (`pi ⬝ᵥ n_u = pj ⬝ᵥ n_u = 0`), with `n_u ≠ 0`, there is a
*second* normal `n'`, linearly independent from `n_u`, to which both points are also orthogonal —
i.e. a second hyperplane through the line `L`. This is the constructed second normal KT's
contrapositive needs for the three "opposite" joins `pᵢ ∨ pⱼ` (the joins through a single panel
`Π(u)`, eq. (6.45)): the per-line transfer
(`extensor_join_eq_zero_of_complementIso_eq_zero_dotProduct`, N3b) consumes a pair `{n_u, n'}` of
independent normals, but a single-panel join supplies only one panel normal directly, so the second
is read off the geometry here.

The common-perp space `W = {x | pi ⬝ᵥ x = 0 ∧ pj ⬝ᵥ x = 0}` is the kernel of
`x ↦ ![pi ⬝ᵥ x, pj ⬝ᵥ x] : ℝ⁴ → ℝ²`, so by rank–nullity `finrank W ≥ 4 − 2 = 2 > 1 = finrank

/-- **The homogeneous incidence core of the witness points, parameterized by the real panel
normals** (`lem:case-III-claim612-points-affineIndep`, the (R1) reconciliation core; Katoh–Tanigawa
2011 §6.4.1 eq. (6.45), Phase 22g). Given **three** real panel normals `n : Fin 3 → ℝ⁴` in
*nonparallel* position (`LinearIndependent ℝ n` — the genericity the `d = 3` `hsplit` producer reads
off its GP split-leg, `notes/Phase22-realization-design.md` §1.41), there exist four homogeneous
coordinate vectors `pbar : Fin 4 → ℝ⁴` that are **linearly independent** and realize KT eq.
(6.45)'s triple-intersection incidence pattern *relative to the real `n`*: `pbar 0` lies on all
three panels (`⟨pbar 0, n u⟩ = 0`), and each `pbar (i+1)` lies on two of the panels but strictly off
the third.

This is the (R1) replacement, at the **homogeneous-vector** layer, for the hardcoded-normals
`exists_affineIndependent_panel_incidence` (which fixes `n = e₀,e₁,e₂`): the producer's witness
points must be orthogonal to the *real* split-leg panel normals `n_a, n_b, n_c`, not to a fixed
coordinate frame. The construction is **genericity-free** — it isolates the genericity-bearing
residual (the de-homogenization to affine `ℝ³` points, i.e. that the orthogonal vectors are not at
infinity) exactly as `exists_ne_zero_dotProduct_eq_zero` / the det-polynomial bricks above isolate
their own ingredients:

* the row matrix `A = of n : Matrix (Fin 3) (Fin 4) ℝ` has linearly independent rows, so
  `A.rank = 3` (`LinearIndependent.rank_matrix`); its image `range A.mulVecLin` then has
  `finrank = 3 = finrank ℝ³`, hence is all of `ℝ³`, so `A.mulVecLin` is **surjective**. Concretely,
  for *any* prescribed pairing target `t : Fin 3 → ℝ` there is `x : ℝ⁴` with `x ⬝ᵥ n u = t u` for
  all `u`. The three points `pbar 1, pbar 2, pbar 3` are the preimages of the standard-basis-like
  targets `(0,0,1)`, `(1,0,0)`, `(0,1,0)` (giving exactly the off-one-panel incidence), and `pbar 0`
  is the nonzero common-perp vector from `exists_ne_zero_dotProduct_eq_zero`;
* linear independence of the four `pbar` is the triangular argument on the incidence matrix: pairing
  `∑ gᵢ • pbar i = 0` against `n 0` kills all but `pbar 2` ⟹ `g 2 = 0`; against `n 1` ⟹ `g 3 = 0`;
  against `n 2` ⟹ `g 1 = 0`; then `g 0 • pbar 0 = 0` with `pbar 0 ≠ 0` ⟹ `g 0 = 0`. No genericity
  of `n` beyond `LinearIndependent` is used.

Graph-free; pure `Fin 4` panel geometry. The affine de-homogenization (the `pbar i = homogenize
(p i)` representatives, the genericity-bearing residual) is the remaining (R1) sub-leaf. -/

`hann` and concluded the per-join annihilation, this strips both and hands over only the **geometric
line data**, on the **homogeneous-vector** layer (bare `pbar`, fed by
`exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals`, §1.42 R1-affine). For each of the six joins `q`, it
produces a **discriminating witness index** `u : Fin 3` (so the witness panel normal is the real
split-leg normal `n u` — the `Fin 3`-valued M₁/M₂/M₃ dispatch input the `hcand`-discharge reads,
§1.50(a)), a second hyperplane `n'` through the join line `L = p̄_c p̄_d` independent from `n u`,

placement needs: `LinearIndependent ![n u, n']`, the four `⬝ᵥ`-orthogonalities

a multigraph `G : Graph α β` together with, for each edge `e : β`, its supporting
`(d-1) = k`-extensor `C(p(e)) = supportExtensor e ∈ ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` — the screw-space
element the rigidity matrix constrains. In the affine model `p(e)` is a
`(d-2) = (k-1)`-dimensional affine *hinge* subspace spanned by `k` points of `ℝ^(k+1)`
and `C(p(e)) = affineSubspaceExtensor (p e)` (Phase 17, the smart constructor `ofHinge`);
the panel model (Phase 21, `PanelHingeFramework.toBodyHinge`) supplies it as a
Grassmann–Cayley meet of two panels instead. Carrying the support extensor directly as a
field decouples the rigidity-matrix rank theory from how the extensor arose, so both the
affine hinge and the panel hinge feed the same constraint family.

The dimension is reparametrized `d = k + 1` (so points live in `ℝ^(k+1)`,
homogenizing to `ℝ^(k+2)`) to clear the `ℕ`-subtractions `d-1`, `d-2` that the
hinge / extensor arities would otherwise carry, matching the Phase 17

linearly independent, then so is the family of rigidity rows `i ↦ hingeRow u v (r i)` it induces on

bodies (`screwDiff_surjective`), its dual map `(screwDiff u v).dualMap = hingeRow u v`
(`hingeRow_eq_dualMap`) is injective (`LinearMap.dualMap_injective_of_surjective`), and an injective
linear map preserves linear independence (`LinearIndependent.map'`).

/-- **A finite family of rows spans the rigidity row space** (`def:rigidity-matrix`,
the genericity device's finite-index input): when the body set `α` is finite, the screw-
assignment space `α → ScrewSpace k` is finite-dimensional (`finrank_screwAssignment`), hence so
is its dual `Module.Dual ℝ (α → ScrewSpace k)` (`Subspace.instModuleDualFiniteDimensional`), and
therefore every submodule of it is finitely generated — in particular `span ℝ F.rigidityRows`. So
there is a *finite* family `a : Fin n → Module.Dual ℝ (α → ScrewSpace k)` with the same span as
the (a priori infinite) row set `rigidityRows`,
`span ℝ (range a) = span ℝ F.rigidityRows` (`Submodule.fg_iff_exists_fin_generating_family`).

This supplies the finite-index spanning family `a` (with `hspanrows`) that the Phase-21b
genericity device's consumer-facing capstone `hglue_of_realization` requires of each consumer: the
device's engine needs a finite index type, and the constant-path route reads the corank off this
family at the single hand-built realization `F`. The remaining Case-I inputs (the matching-size
independent subfamily) come from `exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor` through the hinge-row
block. -/

(`panelSupportExtensor_ne_zero_iff`) — the hinge-row block `r(p(e)) = (span C(p(e)))^⊥` has
dimension `D − 1`, `finrank ℝ (F.hingeRowBlock e) = screwDim k − 1`. This is Katoh–Tanigawa's
`(D−1) × D` block-row count `1 ≤ i ≤ D−1` carried basis-free: the supporting extensor spans a
`1`-dimensional subspace of the `D`-dimensional screw space (`finrank_span_singleton`,
`screwSpace_finrank`), and the dual annihilator's dimension is the codimension
(`Subspace.finrank_add_finrank_dualAnnihilator_eq`). It is the per-edge brick that counts the

/-- **A single transversal hinge contributes `D − 1` independent rigidity rows**
(`def:rigidity-matrix`, the per-edge half of the Case-I `hindep`/`hmatch` assembly). For a genuine
edge `e = uv` with distinct endpoints (`u ≠ v`) whose supporting extensor is nonzero (the
transversal / general-position hinge, `panelSupportExtensor_ne_zero_iff`), there is a linearly
independent family of `D − 1 = screwDim k − 1` rigidity rows, all members of `F.rigidityRows`.
The family is `hingeRow u v` applied to a basis of the hinge-row block: the `(D−1)`-dimensional
hinge-row block `r(p(e))` (`finrank_hingeRowBlock`) has a basis of `D − 1` functionals, supplied
in ambient-coerced existence form by `Submodule.exists_linearIndependent_fin_of_finrank_eq` (so
the heavy `Module.Dual` of an exterior power is never unfolded). Each basis functional lies in
`r(p(e))`, so its `hingeRow u v` image is a rigidity row (witnessed by `e, u, v`), and the
basis-independent functionals stay independent as rigidity rows through the relative-screw
evaluation (`linearIndependent_hingeRow`). This is the per-edge brick that counts and produces the
matching-size independent rigidity-row subfamily the Case-I capstone `hglue_of_realization` needs:
each transversal hinge of a rigid block contributes exactly `D − 1` independent rows of `R(G,p)`,
all routed through the same `screwDiff u v`. -/

/-- **A rigidity row that vanishes off body `v`'s column factors through that column** (the pure
linear-algebra core of KT eq.~(6.28); Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1, Phase 22d). The candidate-%
completion row operation of eq.~(6.24)–(6.28) reduces the $(vb)i^*$-row of $R(G, p_1)$ to a row
whose $V \setminus \{v\}$ part is *all zero* — by definition, a functional `f` on the screw
assignments `α → ScrewSpace k` that vanishes on every assignment supported off `v` (`S v = 0 ⟹
f S = 0`). This lemma is the formal content of "such a row is determined by its `v`-column": writing
`S = Pi.single v (S v) + (S - Pi.single v (S v))`, the second summand is supported off `v` so `f`
kills it, leaving `f S = f (Pi.single v (S v)) = (f ∘ single v) (S v)`. Hence
`f = (f ∘ₗ single v) ∘ₗ proj v` factors through body `v`'s screw column.

This is exactly the structural input the candidate-completion's block-triangular rank lift needs:
the row-operation output of eq.~(6.28) becomes a *pure `v`-column* row `(Σⱼ λ_{(ab)j} rⱼ(q(ab)), 0)`
(eq.~(6.29)'s `(vb)i^*`-row), which then joins the $va$-block in the pin-a-body new block of
`linearIndependent_sum_pinned_block` — lifting `v`'s column contribution from `D − 1` to `D`, the
missing `+1` that takes the stratum-1 brick `D(|V|−1) − 1` to full `D(|V|−1)`. -/

§6.4.1, eqs.~(6.14)–(6.15); Phase 22e). The change-of-variables automorphism on the screw
assignments `α → ScrewSpace k` that adds body `v`'s screw column to body `a`'s — modelled, since
the rigidity rows read relative screws `S u − S w`, as its *dual* substitution on the assignment:
`Φ S = Function.update S v (S v + S a)` (it is `col_a += col_v` acting on rows, equivalently
`row_v += row_a` on the column-vector `S`). It is a linear automorphism with inverse
`Φ⁻¹ S = Function.update S v (S v − S a)`; both directions need `v ≠ a` so that the update at `v`
leaves the `a`-coordinate fixed. A rank is invariant under this change of variables (precomposition
with a `≃ₗ`), so it certifies the candidate row's vanishing without changing any rank: it is the
device that makes the transported `(vb)i^*`-row `hingeRow v a ρ` (supported on *both* columns `v`
and `a`) into a pure `v`-column row in the operated frame — see `hingeRow_comp_columnOp_apply`. -/

b = x + 0 = x` (using `v ≠ b`, so the distinct `b`-coordinate is `0`), and at every other body it
is `Function.update`-untouched. Hence precomposing the candidate producers' `(rn ·) ∘ₗ Φ ∘ₗ

/-- **The star independence bridge: rows from distinct hinges at a common body are jointly
independent** (`def:rigidity-matrix`, the Case-I cross-hinge `hindep` step). Fix a body `v` and a
family of distinct other endpoints `w : J → α` (`hw` injective, `hwv` each `w j ≠ v`) — a *star*
of edges all incident to `v`, the shape a rigid block pinned at `v` presents. If for each `j : J`
the hinge-row functionals `r j : Iⱼ → Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)` are linearly independent, then
the combined rigidity-row family `⟨j, i⟩ ↦ hingeRow (w j) v (r j i)` over the disjoint union
`Σ j, Iⱼ` is linearly independent on `α → ScrewSpace k`.

This is the cross-hinge step the per-edge brick `exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_edge` does not
cover: rows from *different* hinges go through *different* relative-screw evaluations
`screwDiff (w j) v`, so `linearIndependent_hingeRow`'s single-edge dual-map argument no longer
applies. The independence is instead the *pin-a-body* / disjoint-support count: evaluating a
vanishing combination at the screw assignment `Function.update 0 (w k) x` (place `x` on the body
`w k`, `0` elsewhere — legitimate since `w k ≠ v` and the `w j` are distinct) collapses it to
`∑ i, c⟨k,i⟩ • (r k i) x = 0` for all `x`, so per-hinge independence
(`Fintype.linearIndependent_iff` on `r k`) forces every coefficient at `k` to vanish. This is the
joint independence of the rigid block's hinge rows that `hglue_of_realization`'s `hindep` consumes
— each of the block's transversal hinges contributing its `D − 1` rows
(`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_edge`), the rows of distinct hinges jointly independent because
they live on disjoint body-coordinate blocks once the common body is pinned. -/

decomposition (Lemma 5.1, `finrank_pinnedMotions_add_screwDim`) certifying the joint independence
of the two blocks the Case-II $1$-extension placement assembles: a *new* block `rn` of rigidity
rows carried by the re-inserted body `v`'s incident hinges, and an *old* block `ro` of rows of the
common subgraph `G − v`. The split is the body-`v` column: pinning the screw assignment to body `v`
alone (`Function.update 0 v x`) reads the old rows as `0` (their edges avoid `v`, `hold`) while
reading the new rows through `v`'s screw column (`rn i ∘ₗ LinearMap.single ℝ _ v`). So if the new
rows are independent *as functionals of `v`'s screw* (`hnewpin`, the $D-1$ column-block rows of

the union `Sum.elim rn ro` is independent: a vanishing combination, evaluated at `update 0 v x`,
collapses to the new block (old terms vanish by `hold`) and forces the new coefficients to vanish
by `hnewpin`; the residual is a vanishing combination of the old block, forcing the old
coefficients by `holdindep`. This is the panel-row form of the $1$-extension's exact `+D` rank lift

/-- **The restriction-bottom block-triangular augment (the sibling of
`linearIndependent_sum_pinned_block`, roles transposed)** (`lem:case-III-candidate-row`, the KT
eq.~(6.29) `t = 0` certification shape;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1, Phase 22h). The pin-a-body split `linearIndependent_sum_pinned_block`
proves `Sum.elim rn ro` independent from a *pinned* top block (`rn` independent on body `v`'s screw
column) and a *full*-strength bottom block (`ro` independent as ambient functionals, vanishing on
pure-`v` assignments). The `t = 0` hinge-level family of KT's eq.~(6.29) presents the transposed
shape: the **top** block `top` is the operated, pure-`v`-column candidate rows (vanishing on every
assignment supported off `v`, `htopvanish`), and the **bottom** block `bot` is the chosen split-off
rows carried as `F₀`-rows, independent only *after restriction to `V ∖ {v}`* (`hbotrestrict`, their
composites with the off-`v` projection `P_v S = Function.update S v 0`, expressed as
`id − single v ∘ proj v`). So the augment runs with the block-triangular argument the *other* way
round: evaluate a vanishing combination at the off-`v` assignment `Function.update S v 0` — the
pure-`v` top rows vanish there (`htopvanish`), leaving a vanishing combination of the restricted
bottom rows `bot ∘ P_v`, whose coefficients vanish by `hbotrestrict`; the residual is a vanishing
combination of `top` alone, and pinning to body `v`'s column (composing with `single v`) forces the
top coefficients by `htoppin`. This is the abstract count carrier of the M₁/M₂/M₃ arms' `t = 0`
certification (design §1.50(c)): the top is the candidate-completion's extra `D` rows, the bottom is
the `D(|V_v|−1)` split-off rows reproduced as `F₀`-rows, the union's independence the eq.~(6.29)
full `D(|V|−1)`. Graph-free and carrier-free pure linear algebra (the `ofNormals`/`withGraph` defeq

in the `hnewpin` slot rather than needing the old-block `hold` vanishing. The `+1` over the

/-- **Swapping the candidate row by an old/new-block combination preserves independence**
(`lem:case-III-candidate-row`, the abstract row-operation core of KT eq.~(6.27); Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
§6.4.1, Phase 22g). The candidate-completion family is
`Sum.elim (Sum.elim rn (fun _ : Unit => w)) ro`
— the new block `rn`, the old block `ro`, and the single candidate row `w`. The genericity-device
feed (`hasFullRankRealization_of_independent_panelRow_index`) needs every member of the independent
family to be a genuine `panelRow` of the candidate placement, but the per-candidate producers
(`linearIndependent_sum_{p2,p3,augment}_candidateRow`) deliver the candidate row in a `hingeRow`
form `w` that is *not* itself a panel row. KT's eq.~(6.27) closes this by a **row operation**: the
transported `(vb)i^*`-row `hingeRow v b ρ` (a genuine rigidity row, `exists_candidate_row_eq612`)
minus its inductive `(ab)`-part `wGv = hingeRow a b ρ` — an element of the *old* block's span —
collapses to the pure `(va)`-hinge candidate row `hingeRow v a ρ`. Adding a combination of the other
rows to one row of a matrix never changes its rank, and this lemma is that fact for the candidate
summand: if the family with candidate row `w` is linearly independent and `w'` differs from `w` by
an element of the span of the *remaining* rows `Sum.elim rn ro` (`hdiff`), then the family with the
swapped candidate row `w'` is again linearly independent.

The proof reassociates the `(ιn ⊕ Unit) ⊕ ιo` index to `(ιn ⊕ ιo) ⊕ Unit` (the candidate summand
last), so the row-space criterion `linearIndependent_sumElim_unit_iff` reads the independence as
`w ∉ span (range (Sum.elim rn ro))`; since `w' − w` lies in that span, `w'` is fresh iff `w` is.
Graph-free and carrier-free (pure linear algebra on the dual space), so the recurring
`ofNormals`/`withGraph` defeq trap (TACTICS-QUIRKS §38) does not bite. -/

original `D(|V|−1)`-size family** (`lem:case-III-candidate-row`, KT eqs.~(6.14)–(6.16), (6.29);
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1, the candidate-completion's column-operated block-triangular `+1`,
Phase 22e). The producer that takes the stratum-1 brick's two blocks (`rn` the new `va`-block, `ro`
the old split-off block) plus the candidate row `w = hingeRow v a ρ` (supported on *both* columns
`v` and `a`) and assembles them into one linearly independent family
`Sum.elim (Sum.elim rn (fun _ : Unit => w)) ro` — the original (un-operated) rows of `R(G, p_1)`,
the missing `+1` lifting the brick's `D(|V|−1) − 1` to full `D(|V|−1)`.

The argument is KT's column operation `Φ = columnOp hva` (`col_a += col_v`, eqs.~(6.14)–(6.15)).
Precomposing the whole family with `Φ` (a linear automorphism, hence preserving independence via the
dual equivalence `Φ.dualMap`) turns it into the *operated* family
`Sum.elim (Sum.elim (rn ·∘ₗ Φ) (w ∘ₗ Φ)) (ro ·∘ₗ Φ)`, in which the candidate row `w ∘ₗ Φ` is a
**pure `v`-column** row (`hingeRow_comp_columnOp_vanish_off`, eq.~(6.28)): it joins the new block in
the pin-a-body augment (`linearIndependent_sum_pinned_block_augment`) rather than needing the
old-block vanishing. The old rows are unchanged by `Φ` *at the pin assignment* `update 0 v x` —
since `Φ` only modifies column `v` and `Φ (update 0 v x) = update 0 v x` (using `v ≠ a`, so column
`a` reads `0`), `(ro_j ∘ₗ Φ)(update 0 v x) = ro_j (update 0 v x) = 0` (`holdop` from `hold`); the
new rows' `v`-column pins are unchanged. So the operated family meets the augment's hypotheses,
with the eq.~(6.29) top-left `D × D` full rank `hnewpinaug` (the `va`-block's `D − 1` pinned rows
plus the operated `w`'s `v`-column) the **conditional** = Claim~6.12 territory, passed through. The
operated family's independence transports back through `Φ.dualMap` (injective) to give the original
family's independence. -/

`Sum.elim (Sum.elim (rn ·∘ₗ Φ) (w ∘ₗ Φ)) (ro ·∘ₗ Φ)`. There the operated top block — the `va`-rows
plus the operated candidate row, all pure-`v`-column — meets the *top*-vanishing hypothesis of the
restriction-bottom augment `linearIndependent_sum_restriction_block`, the operated top is
pinned-independent on body `v`'s column (`hnewpinaug`, eq.~(6.29) top-left `D × D` full rank = the
Claim~6.12 conditional, passed through), and the operated bottom is independent after restriction to
`V ∖ {v}` (`hbotrestrict`). The augment fires, and the operated family's independence transports
back through `Φ.dualMap` (injective) to the original family
`Sum.elim (Sum.elim rn (fun _ : Unit => hingeRow v a ρ)) ro` — the eq.~(6.29) certified count at
`F₀`. Graph-free / carrier-free pure linear algebra (the `ofNormals`/`withGraph` defeq trap,

`(hingeRow v b ρ ∘ₗ Φ) S = ρ(S v)`, and `single v x` reads `x` at `v`, so the composite is
`x ↦ ρ x`. This identifies the operated, pinned `(vb)i^*`-row — the candidate-completion's extra
top-left-block row — with the abstract candidate functional `ρ` on `ScrewSpace k`, so the row-space

`(rn ·∘ₗ Φ) ∘ₗ single v`, linearly independent (`hrnpin`) and spanning the whole hinge-row block
`r(p(e)) = (span C(e))^⊥` (`hspan`; `lem:case-II-placement-new-rows` supplies them at the

isomorphism `G_v^{ab} ≅ G_a^{vc}` (`ρ : V∖{a} → V∖{v}`, `ρ(v) = a`, identity otherwise) is handled
**functionally**, not by an `ofNormals` graph swap: the candidate row is `hingeRow a c ρ_c` for the
candidate functional `ρ_c` on `ScrewSpace k`, and the producer is the *same* candidate-completion
assembly (`linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow`) instantiated at the column op
`Φ = columnOp hac` for the edge `ac` in place of `va` — the split body is `a`, its operated endpoint
`c`. Its one hypothesis — the operated, `a`-pinned top-left block being full rank — is supplied by
the row-space criterion (`linearIndependent_sumElim_candidateRow_iff`) at the `ac`-hinge `e` once
the operated, pinned candidate row `(hingeRow a c ρ_c) ∘ Φ ∘ single a` is identified with `ρ_c`
itself (the column op makes it pure `a`-column with value `ρ_c(S_a)`,
`hingeRow_comp_columnOp_comp_single`), which holds iff `ρ_c(C(e)) ≠ 0`. This is KT's `M₃`

link to the *same* common vector `r̂` the `M₁/M₂` criteria use is eq.~(6.44)
(`candidateRow_ac_eq_neg`): the `M₃` candidate functional `ρ_c` is `−r̂` restricted to the
`c`-endpoint, so the Claim-6.12 capstone (`lem:case-III-claim612`) reads its criterion off the

candidate vector is not orthogonal to its supporting extensor** (`lem:case-III-candidate-row`, the
selector recast of the `M₁` candidate-completion assembly; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1, Phase 22g).
The first of Claim~6.12's three candidates is `p₁` itself — split off at `v` along the *original*
edge `va` — so it has no separate producer: it is the candidate-completion assembly
(`linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow`) applied directly at the column op `Φ = columnOp hva`
for the edge `va`, with the operated top-left block `hnewpinaug` supplied by the row-space criterion
(`linearIndependent_sumElim_candidateRow_iff`) at the `va`-hinge `e`. This packages it into the same
`hsel₁` selector shape
`r̂(C(e)) ≠ 0 → LinearIndependent (Sum.elim (Sum.elim rn {hingeRow v a r̂}) ro)`
that the `d = 3` `hsplit` producer's line-indexed candidate construction
(`case_III_hsplit_producer`) consumes, matching the `hsel₂`/`hsel₃` recasts. Unlike those two —
which delegate the `hnewpinaug`
discharge to the `p₂`/`p₃` producers — this one builds the operated block inline (there is no `M₁`
producer to delegate to): once the operated, pinned candidate row `(hingeRow v a r̂) ∘ Φ ∘ single v`
is identified with `r̂` (`hingeRow_comp_columnOp_comp_single`), the row-space criterion's
`ScrewSpace k`-level iff reads on `hnewpinaug` directly. Graph-free (abstract `F`). -/

(`lem:case-III-claim612-r-nonzero`, KT eq.~(6.42); Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1, Phase 22e).
The candidate row shared by all three
blocks `M₁/M₂/M₃` of Claim~6.12 is `r̂ := ∑_j λ_{(ab)j} r_j(q(ab))`, where the `r_j` are the
`D − 1` linearly independent rows of the `ab`-hinge block (`lem:case-II-placement-new-rows`) and
the coefficients `λ_{(ab)j}` come from the redundant-`ab`-row decomposition of eqs.~(6.24)/(6.25)
with the redundant index's coefficient pinned to `λ_{(ab)i^*} = 1`
(`exists_redundant_panelRow_ab_decomposition`). Since `r̂` is a linear combination of the
linearly independent `r_j` carrying the unit (hence nonzero) coefficient `1` on the member `i^*`,
it is nonzero (`linearIndependent_sum_smul_ne_zero`). This is the `r ≠ 0` leaf the Claim-6.12
capstone (`lem:case-III-claim612`) contradicts after the three blocks' joint dependence forces
`r̂ = 0`. -/

/-- **Eq.~(6.44): the `M₃` candidate row equals `−r̂`, routing the third candidate onto the same
common vector** (`lem:case-III-claim612-eq644`, KT eq.~(6.44); Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1,
Phase 22e). The `a`-column block of the eq.~(6.24) vanishing combination `g` is `0`
(`exists_redundant_panelRow_ab_decomposition_acolumn_zero`, eq.~(6.43)): `g.comp (single a) = 0`.
KT's eq.~(6.44) is what that restriction *says* once the combination is regrouped by which edge
each term sits on. In `G_v^{ab}` body `a` is a **degree-2** vertex --- only the `ab`- and `ac`-edges
are incident to it --- so by the column-restriction leaves (`hingeRow_comp_single_tail` /
`hingeRow_comp_single_off`) the only terms of `g` surviving in body `a`'s screw column are the
`ab`-sum, whose `a`-column restriction is the common candidate row `r̂ := ∑_j λ_{(ab)j} r_j(q(ab))`,
and the `ac`-sum, with restriction `rAC := ∑_j λ_{(ac)j} r_j(q(ac))`. Hence
`0 = g.comp (single a) = r̂ + rAC`, i.e.\ KT's eq.~(6.44)
\[ r̂ \;=\; -\,\mathrm{rAC} \;=\; -\sum_j λ_{(ac)j}\, r_j(q(ac)). \]
The `M₃` candidate's full-rank criterion is `rAC ∉ (\operatorname{span} C(L''))^\perp`
(`lem:case-III-claim612-p3-placement`); eq.~(6.44) rewrites it as `r̂ ⊥ C(L'')` --- the same common
vector `r̂` the `M₁/M₂` criteria use, which is exactly what lets the Claim-6.12 capstone
(`lem:case-III-claim612`) force the *single* `r̂` orthogonal to all of `C(L), C(L'), C(L'')` and so
to a spanning set, contradicting `r̂ ≠ 0`.

Stated abstractly (graph-free, matching the candidate-completion chain): the `ab`-sum and `ac`-sum
are explicit `hingeRow`-sums out of the common tail body `a` (into the distinct bodies `b`, `c`),
and `grest` is the remaining edges' contribution, which the degree-2-at-`a` fact (`hrest`: every
such edge is incident to neither endpoint at `a`) makes vanish on `a`'s column. The conclusion is
the `M₃` row `rAC := ∑_j λac_j • rac_j` equal to `-r̂` with `r̂ := ∑_j λab_j • rab_j`. The `ab`/`ac`
column restrictions are computed by `hingeRow_comp_single_tail`; the `grest` one by
`hingeRow_comp_single_off`. -/

/-- **Claim 6.12 — for some line choice, the candidate block is full rank**
(`lem:case-III-claim612`, Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1, Claim 6.12, eqs. (6.30)–(6.45); Phase 22g).
The capstone of the candidate-selection argument at `d = 3`, stated as the **existential** it
actually is: KT's lines `L ⊂ Π(u)` are *freely chosen* (eqs. (6.12)/(6.42)), so the claim is that
*for some* choice the candidate's top-left `D × D` block is full rank — equivalently (the row-space
criterion `linearIndependent_sumElim_candidateRow_iff` at the candidate's hinge) the common
candidate row `r̂ := ∑_j λ_{(ab)j} r_j(q(ab))` is **not** orthogonal to that block's supporting
extensor. Since a candidate's hinge support is the panel-meet of a line `L` (PanelHinge, `rfl`) and
the panel-meet of a line through two of the four points is exactly one of their six joins
`pᵢ ∨ pⱼ = omitTwoExtensor (homogenize ∘ p)`, the existential is stated over those **six joins**:
`∃ q, r̂(pᵢ ∨ pⱼ) ≠ 0`.

The argument is a clean contrapositive of the existential. If `r̂` annihilated *every* one of the
six joins — KT's union-(6.45) "for *every* choice of lines `L ⊂ Π(a)`, `L' ⊂ Π(b)`, `L'' ⊂ Π(c)`"
— then since those six joins of four linearly-independent homogeneous vectors **span** `ScrewSpace 2
= ⋀²ℝ⁴` (`span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top`, N1, via Lemma 2.1), `r̂` would annihilate their
span and so be `0` (`eq_zero_of_annihilates_span_top`, N2), contradicting `r̂ ≠ 0` (N5). The
annihilation hypothesis is *not* a carried premise: it is precisely the internal `by_contra`
negation `∀ q, r̂(join q) = 0`. The earlier three-fixed-`Cᵢ` disjunction conclusion
(`r̂(C₁) ≠ 0 ∨ r̂(C₂) ≠ 0 ∨ r̂(C₃) ≠ 0` at three *hardcoded* lines) was *mathematically
undischargeable* — three `2`-extensors span ≤ 3 of the 6 dimensions of `⋀²ℝ⁴`, so `r̂ ⊥ C₁,C₂,C₃`
cannot force `r̂ = 0`; only the full line sweep (Lemma 2.1) does. The producer
(`case_III_hsplit_producer`) consumes the existential by building its candidate placement so
its hinge line *is* the witness join's line `L = p̄ᵢ p̄ⱼ`. The points enter at the
**homogeneous-vector**
layer (bare `LinearIndependent ℝ pbar`, fed by `exists_homogeneousIncidence_of_normals`); no affine
de-homogenization is needed (`notes/Phase22-realization-design.md` §1.42, R1-affine). -/

(`exists_affineIndependent_panel_incidence`: three panel normals `n : Fin 3 → ℝ⁴`,
`LinearIndependent`, and four affinely-independent points `p : Fin 4 → ℝ³` with the
triple-intersection incidence tabulation) and the **failed-block annihilation** hypothesis `hann`:
`r` annihilates the panel-meet `C(L) = complementIso (n u ∧ m)` of *every* line `L ⊂ Π(u)` — i.e.
of panel `Π(u)` (the normal `n u`) with any second hyperplane `m` independent from `n u` (KT's "for
any choice of lines `L ⊂ Π(a)`, `L' ⊂ Π(b)`, `L'' ⊂ Π(c)`", eqs. (6.42)–(6.44), what the failed
contrapositive supplies on each of the three failed candidate blocks).

`p̄_c p̄_d` lies in (each endpoint pair of the four points shares ≥ 1 panel, from the incidence
tabulation): the three joins through `p 0` share two panels (use the panel normal `n u` and a second
panel normal), the three "opposite" joins share one panel (use `n u` and a *constructed* second
normal `n'` through the line, `exists_independent_perp_pair`). Either way the brick's pair
`{n_u, n'}` is independent with both kept points orthogonal to both, and `hann` supplies the meet
annihilation, completing the witness. Graph-free (pure `Fin 4` panel geometry); the `r`/`Cᵢ`/`p`

`r(pᵢ ∨ pⱼ) ≠ 0`; the per-join line data (`exists_line_data_of_homogeneousIncidence`) exhibits the
join line `L = pᵢ pⱼ` inside a panel `Π(n u)` with a second hyperplane `n'`; and the per-line
duality (`extensor_join_eq_zero_of_complementIso_eq_zero_dotProduct`, contrapositive) forces
`r(C(L)) ≠ 0` from `r(pᵢ ∨ pⱼ) ≠ 0`. The resulting `u`, `{n u, n'}` with
`r(complementIso (n u ∧ n')) ≠ 0` is the nonzero-candidate-row input the producer's eq. (6.12)
candidate placement consumes (its hinge line is built to be exactly this witness line `L`); the
returned `u : Fin 3` is the M₁/M₂/M₃ dispatch index the `hcand`-discharge reads (§1.50(a)).

/-- **Cross-hinge independence over a rigid block of edges spanning many bodies**
(`def:rigidity-matrix`, the Case-I `hindep` step in its general form). The multi-body
generalization of `linearIndependent_hingeRow_star`: where the star fixes one common body `v`,
here each hinge `j : J` is oriented from a *private endpoint* `u j` — the "child" vertex of a
spanning forest of the rigid block, so the `u j` are distinct (`hu` injective) — to an arbitrary
*other endpoint* `other j`, subject only to the **forest separation** hypothesis `hsep`: no
other-endpoint of any hinge is the private endpoint of any hinge (`other j ≠ u j'` for all
`j, j'`; in particular `u j ≠ other j`). If for each `j` the hinge-row functionals
`r j : Iⱼ → Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)` are linearly independent, the combined rigidity-row
family `⟨j, i⟩ ↦ hingeRow (u j) (other j) (r j i)` over `Σ j, Iⱼ` is linearly independent on
`α → ScrewSpace k`.

This is the cross-hinge step a genuine rigid block — a spanning tree / forest of the contracted
block, hinges spanning *multiple* bodies rather than a single pinned `v` — presents to
`hglue_of_realization`'s `hindep`. The star (`linearIndependent_hingeRow_star`) is the special
case `u = w`, `other = const v`: there `hsep` is `w j' ≠ v`, here it is the forest property that
each hinge has a private child vertex incident to no other hinge of the block. The proof is the
same *pin-a-body* / disjoint-support count, pinning the private endpoint `u j₀` rather than the
common body: evaluating a vanishing combination at the screw assignment `Function.update 0 (u j₀)
x` reads `0` on every hinge `j ≠ j₀` (its private endpoint `u j ≠ u j₀` by injectivity, its other
endpoint `other j ≠ u j₀` by `hsep`) and `x` on hinge `j₀` (its other endpoint `other j₀ ≠ u j₀`
again by `hsep`), collapsing to `∑ i, c⟨j₀,i⟩ • (r j₀ i) x = 0` for all `x`, so per-hinge
independence forces every coefficient at `j₀` to vanish. -/

/-- **A rigid block's spanning forest of transversal hinges yields `(D−1)·|J|` independent
rigidity rows** (`def:rigidity-matrix`, the Case-I `hindep`/`hmatch` assembly in its general form).
This is the multi-body assembly the hand-off flagged: it combines the per-edge brick
`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_edge` (each transversal hinge contributing `D − 1 = screwDim
k − 1` independent rows through the same relative-screw evaluation `screwDiff (u j) (other j)`) with
the cross-hinge combination `linearIndependent_hingeRow_forest` (rows of *distinct* hinges jointly
independent by the pin-a-body count over the spanning forest).

Concretely, for a family of hinges `j : J` of a rigid block oriented along a spanning forest — each
edge `e j` linking a *private endpoint* `u j` (the forest child, so `u` injective) to an arbitrary
`other j`, with the forest-separation hypothesis `hsep : ∀ j j', other j ≠ u j'` and every hinge
transversal (`he : F.supportExtensor (e j) ≠ 0`) — there is a linearly independent family of
rigidity rows indexed by the disjoint union `Σ j, Fin (screwDim k − 1)`, all members of
`F.rigidityRows`. The index type has cardinality `|J|·(screwDim k − 1)` (`Nat.card_sigma`), so this
is the matching-size independent subfamily `s` the Case-I capstone `hglue_of_realization` consumes:
its `hindep` is the joint independence and its `hmatch` count is `|J|·(D − 1)`, matched against the
contraction's inductive rank. The per-edge block functionals `c j` (a basis of the
`(D−1)`-dimensional hinge-row block `r(p(e j))`, `finrank_hingeRowBlock`) are extracted by
`exists_linearIndependent_fin_of_finrank_eq`, fed to `linearIndependent_hingeRow_forest` for the
joint independence, and witnessed as rigidity rows via the link `hlink j` and block membership. -/

/-- **An independent family of constraint spans admits no nonzero cycle of differences**
(`lem:cycle-realization`, the linear-algebra core of the `m`-body cycle): if `c : Fin m →
ScrewSpace k` is linearly independent and a family `d : Fin m → ScrewSpace k` has each
`d i ∈ span {c i}` with `∑ i, d i = 0`, then every `d i = 0`. This is the screw-space fact
behind Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 5.4 for a cycle of length `m`: around a cycle the relative-screw
differences `d i = S(vᵢ) − S(vᵢ₊₁)` lie in the one-dimensional hinge spans `span C(p(eᵢ))`
and telescope to `∑ d i = 0`, so independence of the `m` supporting extensors forces every
difference to vanish — the `m`-edge generalization of
`span_inf_span_eq_bot_of_linearIndependent` (the `m = 2` antiparallel case). Each `d i` is a
scalar multiple `aᵢ • c i` (`Submodule.mem_span_singleton`), and `∑ aᵢ • c i = 0` with the
`c i` independent forces every `aᵢ = 0` (`Fintype.linearIndependent_iff`). -/

`fun u => S u - S v` (which vanishes at `v` and is still a motion by

/-- **Pinning one body preserves rank** (`lem:rank-delete-vertex`, Katoh--Tanigawa Lemma 5.1):
deleting the `D` columns of a single body `v` from the rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` drops exactly the
`D` trivial-motion dimensions, leaving the rank unchanged. In the codimension form: the null
space `Z(G,p)` is the internal direct sum of the `D`-dimensional trivial motions and the
body-`v`-pinned motions, so

  `finrank (pinnedMotions v) + D = finrank Z(G,p)`,

equivalently `rank R(G,p) = rank R(G,p; V ∖ v)`. The `D` trivial motions
(`lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound`) normalize any motion to vanish on the pinned body
(`isInfinitesimalMotion_sub_const`), the pin-a-body motion-space fact of
White--Whiteley~`whiteWhiteley1987`. -/

/-- **Refining the hinge spans shrinks the motion space** (`lem:rank-rotation-semicont`,
Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 5.2, span/monotonicity form). If two body-hinge frameworks `F`, `F'`
share the same underlying multigraph and at every edge the constraint span of `F` is contained
in that of `F'` — i.e. `F'` is the *more general* (more constrained) realization, the generic
member of a rotation family — then every infinitesimal motion of `F'` is one of `F`:
`F'.infinitesimalMotions ≤ F.infinitesimalMotions`. The stronger (larger-span) constraints of
`F'` cut out a smaller null space.

This is the basis-free core of the lower-semicontinuity of `rank R(G,p)`: along a one-parameter
family rotating a panel, the generic realization has the *largest* supporting spans (the hinge
points in general position), hence the *smallest* motion space and the *largest* rank
(`finrank_infinitesimalMotions_le_of_span_le`). We carry it as this monotonicity-under-span-
refinement statement — matching the basis-free treatment of Lemmas 5.1/5.3 — rather than the
literal analytic one-parameter semicontinuity, which would force the parametrized
polynomial-entry coordinate matrix the design defers (the genericity-over-perturbation choice of
the risk register). -/

/-- **Rank is lower-semicontinuous under hinge-span refinement** (`lem:rank-rotation-semicont`,
Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 5.2, rank form). If `F'` refines `F` — same graph, every constraint span
of `F` contained in that of `F'` — then the motion space of `F'` has no larger dimension than
that of `F`:

  `finrank Z(G, p') ≤ finrank Z(G, p)`,

equivalently `rank R(G, p) ≤ rank R(G, p')` (the rank is the codimension `D|V| − finrank Z` and
`finrank Z` only shrinks under refinement, `finrank_screwAssignment`). So the *generic* member of
a one-parameter rotation family — the one whose hinges are in general position, with the largest
supporting spans — attains the maximum rank, the content of Katoh–Tanigawa's Lemma 5.2: rank
cannot drop at a generic parameter. Immediate from the span-monotonicity
`infinitesimalMotions_mono_of_span_le` and `Submodule.finrank_mono`. -/
