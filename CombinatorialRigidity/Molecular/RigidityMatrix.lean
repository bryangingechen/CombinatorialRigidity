# The panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` (`sec:molecular-rigidity-matrix`)

Phase 18, the second phase of the molecular-conjecture program (Phases 17–26; see
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). Where the body-hinge chapter (Phase 16,
`BodyBar/BodyHinge.lean`) *defined* rigidity by reduction to body-bar on the
multiplied graph `(δ-1)·G` (a standard-basis witness, no honest geometry — the
*existence* form), this file builds the **genuine** panel-hinge / body-hinge
rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` of Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 (*A proof of the molecular
conjecture*, Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, §2.2–2.4), on a realization `p`
assigning a `(d-2)`-dimensional affine *hinge* subspace to each edge.

This file lands the `sec:molecular-rigidity-matrix` dep-graph in dependency order.
The leaf node landing here:

* `BodyHingeFramework` (`def:hinge-constraint`) — a `d`-dimensional body-hinge
  framework `(G,p)` is a multigraph `G : Graph α β` together with a map `p`
  assigning each edge a *hinge*: a `(d-1)`-point family in `ℝ^d` whose affine span
  is a `(d-2)`-dimensional affine subspace. Reparametrizing `d = k+1` to clear the
  `ℕ`-subtraction, a hinge is `Fin k → Fin (k+1) → ℝ` (`k` points in `ℝ^(k+1)`),
  homogenizing to `ℝ^(k+2)`; its supporting `(d-1)`-extensor is the `k`-extensor
  `C(p(e)) = affineSubspaceExtensor (p e) ∈ ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` of Phase 17.
* `hingeConstraint` (`def:hinge-constraint`) — identifying an infinitesimal motion
  of a rigid body with a `D`-dimensional *screw center* `S(v)` living in the
  exterior algebra `ExteriorAlgebra ℝ (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)` (where `C(p(e))` lives), the
  hinge `p(e)` constrains the two screw centers `S(u), S(v)` of its endpoints
  `e = uv` to satisfy
  `S(u) - S(v) ∈ span C(p(e)) = Submodule.span ℝ {affineSubspaceExtensor (p e)}`.

## Carrier and dimension

Infinitesimal motions are `D`-dimensional screw centers with `D = (d+1 choose 2)`,
matching Phase 17's extensor space `⋀^(d-1) ℝ^(d+1) ≅ ℝ^D` (here, with `d = k+1`,
`⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)`). We carry the screw center as an element of the **degree-`k` graded
piece** `⋀[ℝ]^k (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)` of the exterior algebra — the subspace in which the
supporting extensors `C(p(e)) = affineSubspaceExtensor (p e)` actually live
(`affineSubspaceExtensor_mem_exteriorPower`) — rather than a coordinate vector in `ℝ^D`;
`span C(p(e))` is then literally a `Submodule` of it and the hinge constraint is a
membership. The concrete `⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` identification is realized as the `finrank`
equality `screwSpace_finrank : finrank ℝ (ScrewSpace k) = D` (rather than an explicit
basis), the numeric gate for the rank counts of `lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound` and the
degree of freedom of `def:dof-generic`.

Carrier for the multigraph: mathlib core `Graph α β` (the Phase 13–16 carrier).
Carrier for points: `Fin (k+1) → ℝ`, matching Phase 17's `affineSubspaceExtensor`.

/-- The **screw dimension** `D = (d+1 choose 2) = (k+2 choose 2)` of `d = k+1`-dimensional
body-hinge rigidity: the dimension of the screw-center space `ScrewSpace k`, equal to the
dimension `binom(d+1, 2)` of the space of infinitesimal screw motions of a rigid body in
`ℝ^d` (Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §2.2). -/

/-- The **screw-center space** of `d = k+1`-dimensional body-hinge rigidity: the degree-`k`
graded piece `⋀[ℝ]^k (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)` of the exterior algebra, in which the supporting
extensors `C(·) = affineSubspaceExtensor` of the hinges live
(`affineSubspaceExtensor_mem_exteriorPower`). An infinitesimal motion of a rigid body is a
`D`-dimensional *screw center* `S(v)` in this space, `D = screwDim k = (k+2 choose 2)`
(`screwSpace_finrank`). We carry the screw center as the graded-piece element (a `Submodule`
of the full exterior algebra) rather than a coordinate vector in `ℝ^D`, so `span C(p(e))` is
literally a `Submodule` of it (`def:hinge-constraint`); the `⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` identification
of the blueprint is realized by the `finrank` equality `screwSpace_finrank` rather than an
explicit basis. -/

/-- **The screw-center space has dimension `D = (k+2 choose 2)`** (`def:rigidity-matrix`,
the deferred `⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` coordinatization). Since `ScrewSpace k` is the degree-`k`
graded piece of the exterior algebra of `ℝ^(k+2)`, its dimension is `(k+2).choose k`
(`exteriorPower.finrank_eq`), which equals `(k+2).choose 2 = screwDim k` by the symmetry
`binom(n, j) = binom(n, n-j)`. This is the numeric content of the blueprint's
`⋀^k ℝ^(k+2) ≅ ℝ^D` identification — carried as a `finrank` equality rather than an explicit
basis — and is the gate for every numeric rank count (`lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound`'s
`rank R ≤ D(|V|-1)`, the degree of freedom of `def:dof-generic`). -/

independent family of `m` screw-space elements has `m ≤ D = screwDim k`, since
`ScrewSpace k` is `D`-dimensional (`screwSpace_finrank`). This is the dimension bound a panel
*cycle* must respect — a cycle whose `m` supporting extensors are independent in the
`D`-dimensional screw space can have at most `m ≤ D` hinges, the upper half `|V| ≤ D` of
Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 5.4's hypothesis `3 ≤ |V| ≤ D` (`lem:cycle-realization`). Immediate from
the finite-dimensionality bound `LinearIndependent.fintype_card_le_finrank`. -/

— one per pair, the join `pᵢ ∨ pⱼ` of the line through each pair — span all of
`⋀²ℝ⁴ = ScrewSpace 2`. By Lemma 2.1 (`omitTwoExtensor_linearIndependent` at `e = 2`) the six are
linearly independent in the `6`-dimensional `ScrewSpace 2`, and a linearly independent family of
`6 = finrank ℝ (ScrewSpace 2)` vectors is a basis, hence spans. This is the spanning input to the
Claim-6.12 contrapositive (`lem:case-III-claim612`): a single nonzero `r ∈ ScrewSpace 2`
annihilating every supporting extensor in the union (6.45) is forced to be `0`. -/

`r : Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)` vanishes on every element of a set `S` whose span is all of
`ScrewSpace k`, then `r = 0`. Two linear maps agreeing on a spanning set are equal
(`LinearMap.ext_on`); `r` agrees with the zero functional on `S` and `span S = ⊤`, so `r = 0` — the
non-degeneracy of the dual pairing on `ℝ^D`. This is
the final step of the Claim-6.12 contrapositive (`lem:case-III-claim612`): the common vector `r` is
orthogonal to every supporting extensor in KT's union (6.45), which the six panel-support extensors
of four affinely-independent points force to span `ScrewSpace 2` (`span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top`), so
`r = 0`, contradicting `r ≠ 0`. -/

/-- **The intersection of `< d+1` panel hyperplanes in `ℝ^(d+1)` is nonempty as a projective
locus** (`lem:case-III-claim612-points-affineIndep`, the existence half of KT eq. (6.45)'s point
choice; the `j`-hyperplane intersection brick). Given a family `n : Fin m → (Fin (d+1) → ℝ)` of
`m` panel normals with `m < d + 1`, the homogeneous incidence system `⟨p̄, n i⟩ = 0` for all `i`
has a *nonzero* solution `p̄ : Fin (d+1) → ℝ`: the `m × (d+1)` coefficient matrix has strictly more
columns than rows, so its null space is nontrivial. This is the geometric existence step behind
KT's "for any `j` of the hyperplanes their intersection forms a `(d-j)`-dimensional affine space"
(p. 698, eq. (6.67)): with `m = j` panels, the homogeneous (projective) solution set is a genuine
`(d+1-j)`-dimensional subspace, hence nonempty, so a representative homogeneous point exists on
every one of the chosen panels. (The *affine independence* of the four chosen points — that they
span an affine `3`-simplex at `d = 3` — is the genericity content of the full
`lem:case-III-claim612-points-affineIndep`, still red: it needs the affine-independence determinant
nonvanishing from the algebraic independence of the panel coefficients, `lem:genericity-device`.) -/

/-- **The product-route producer for generic affine independence**
(`lem:case-III-claim612-points-affineIndep`, the genericity-to-realization closure half). Suppose
the `d + 1` candidate points are built as functions `p : (σ → ℝ) → Fin (d+1) → Fin d → ℝ` of a
panel-coordinate seed `q : σ → ℝ`, and their affine-independence determinant — the homogenization
determinant `det (homogenize ∘ (p q)) : ℝ` of `affineIndependent_fin_iff_det_homogenize` — is the
evaluation of a *nonzero* multivariate polynomial `P : MvPolynomial σ ℝ` in `q` (`hdet`). Then there
is a seed `q` at which the points `p q` are **affinely independent**.

This is the genericity-free *closure* step: it composes the device's foundational non-root brick
`MvPolynomial.exists_eval_ne_zero` (over the infinite field `ℝ`, a nonzero polynomial does not
vanish identically; the same brick Case I uses to pick a shared seed) with the determinant
characterization `affineIndependent_fin_iff_det_homogenize` (Lemma 2.1, top-extensor form). It
carries the genericity *content* as the hypothesis `hdet` — that the affine-independence
determinant, as a function of the seed, is a nonzero polynomial — which is the irreducible
genericity remainder of N3a (KT p. 691/698, `lem:genericity-device`: the determinant is nonzero
because the panel coefficients are algebraically independent over `ℚ`). Parallel to the existence
half `exists_ne_zero_dotProduct_eq_zero`, this isolates the genuinely genericity-bearing fact
(`P ≠ 0`) from the surrounding linear-algebra glue. -/

/-- **The affine-independence determinant of polynomial-valued candidate points is a polynomial in
the seed** (`lem:case-III-claim612-points-affineIndep`, the determinant-polynomial bridge feeding
the closure half). Suppose the `d + 1` candidate points are built coordinate-by-coordinate as
multivariate polynomials in the panel-coordinate seed: a family `pp : Fin (d+1) → Fin d →
MvPolynomial σ ℝ`, with the point `p q i := fun j => eval q (pp i j)`. Then their
affine-independence determinant — the homogenization determinant
`det (homogenize ∘ (p q)) : ℝ` of `affineIndependent_fin_iff_det_homogenize` — is the evaluation at
`q` of a *single* polynomial `P : MvPolynomial σ ℝ`, namely the determinant of the
`(d+1) × (d+1)` polynomial matrix whose rows are the homogenized polynomial points
`Fin.snoc (pp i) 1`.

This discharges the `hdet` hypothesis of the closure producer
`exists_affineIndependent_of_det_polynomial_ne_zero`: the ring homomorphism `eval q` commutes with
`det` (`RingHom.map_det`) and with `Fin.snoc · 1` (it sends the constant final coordinate `1` to
`1`), so evaluating the polynomial determinant at `q` reproduces the real homogenization determinant
of the evaluated points. It isolates the *polynomial-in-the-seed* structure of the determinant from
the genuinely genericity-bearing fact that this polynomial is nonzero (`P ≠ 0`, the irreducible
remainder of N3a, the genericity device `lem:genericity-device`), exactly as the existence half
`exists_ne_zero_dotProduct_eq_zero` and the closure half
`exists_affineIndependent_of_det_polynomial_ne_zero` isolate their own ingredients. -/

/-- **The explicit good seed: four affinely-independent points realizing the
`Π(a)/Π(b)/Π(c)` incidence pattern** (`lem:case-III-claim612-points-affineIndep`, the `P ≠ 0`
existence witness; KT eq. (6.45) point choice). At `d = 3` there exist three panel normals
`n : Fin 3 → ℝ⁴` in *nonparallel* position (`LinearIndependent`) and four **affinely-independent**
points `p : Fin 4 → ℝ³` realizing the triple-intersection incidence pattern of KT eq. (6.45):
`p 0 ∈ Π(a) ∩ Π(b) ∩ Π(c)`, `p 1 ∈ Π(a) ∩ Π(b) ∖ Π(c)`, `p 2 ∈ Π(b) ∩ Π(c) ∖ Π(a)`,
`p 3 ∈ Π(c) ∩ Π(a) ∖ Π(b)`, where panel incidence `p i ∈ Π(u) ⟺ ⟨homogenize (p i), n u⟩ = 0`
(the `⬝ᵥ` of the homogenization with the panel normal).

This is the **existence-route residual** of `lem:case-III-claim612-points-affineIndep`: by the
converse of `MvPolynomial.exists_eval_ne_zero` (the foundational non-root brick the closure half
`exists_affineIndependent_of_det_polynomial_ne_zero` runs forward) and the determinant-polynomial
bridge `exists_detPolynomial_of_pointPolynomial`, the residual `P ≠ 0` of the cross-product
construction (the affine-independence determinant as a polynomial in the panel-coordinate seed) is
*logically equivalent* to exhibiting **one** seed at which the constructed points are affinely
independent — no algebraic independence of the seed is needed, exactly the existence/Zariski route
the pre-Phase-22d genericity sites (Claim 6.4/6.9) used. Here the witness is the coordinate-aligned
seed: panel normals `n_a = e₀`, `n_b = e₁`, `n_c = e₂` (the first three standard covectors of `ℝ⁴`,
hence linearly independent — the nonparallel hypothesis the framework supplies) and the standard
affine `3`-simplex `p = (0, e₃, e₁, e₂)` of `ℝ³` (origin plus three axis points). The incidence
pattern is then immediate from the coordinates: `homogenize (p i)` is orthogonal to exactly the
panel normals whose coordinate it vanishes at, and the `4 × 4` homogenization determinant is
`±1 ≠ 0` (`affineIndependent_fin_iff_det_homogenize` via the explicit `Matrix.det_succ_row_zero`
cofactor expansion). -/

/-- A **`d = k+1`-dimensional body-hinge framework** `(G,p)` (`def:hinge-constraint`):
a multigraph `G : Graph α β` together with, for each edge `e : β`, its supporting
`(d-1) = k`-extensor `C(p(e)) = supportExtensor e ∈ ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` — the screw-space
element the rigidity matrix constrains. In the affine model `p(e)` is a
`(d-2) = (k-1)`-dimensional affine *hinge* subspace spanned by `k` points of `ℝ^(k+1)`
and `C(p(e)) = affineSubspaceExtensor (p e)` (Phase 17, the smart constructor `ofHinge`);
the panel model (Phase 21, `PanelHingeFramework.toBodyHinge`) supplies it as a
Grassmann–Cayley meet of two panels instead. Carrying the support extensor directly as a
field decouples the rigidity-matrix rank theory from how the extensor arose, so both the
affine hinge and the panel hinge feed the same constraint family.

The dimension is reparametrized `d = k + 1` (so points live in `ℝ^(k+1)`,
homogenizing to `ℝ^(k+2)`) to clear the `ℕ`-subtractions `d-1`, `d-2` that the

`hingeRow u w r - hingeRow v w r = hingeRow u v r`: both rows read the relative screw against the

linearly independent, then so is the family of rigidity rows `i ↦ hingeRow u v (r i)` it induces on
the screw-assignment space `α → ScrewSpace k`. Because `screwDiff u v` is surjective at distinct
bodies (`screwDiff_surjective`), its dual map `(screwDiff u v).dualMap = hingeRow u v`
(`hingeRow_eq_dualMap`) is injective (`LinearMap.dualMap_injective_of_surjective`), and an injective
linear map preserves linear independence (`LinearIndependent.map'`).

This turns the independent supporting extensors of a rigid block

`finrank_hingeRowBlock`) into the independent rigidity-row subfamily the Case-I capstone
`hglue_of_realization` needs (`hindep`): one transversal hinge `e = uv` contributes `D − 1`

independent family of `D − 1 = screwDim k − 1` rigidity rows, all members of `F.rigidityRows`.
The family is `hingeRow u v` applied to a basis of the hinge-row block: the `(D−1)`-dimensional
hinge-row block `r(p(e))` (`finrank_hingeRowBlock`) has a basis of `D − 1` functionals, supplied

evaluation (`linearIndependent_hingeRow`). This is the per-edge brick that counts and produces the
matching-size independent rigidity-row subfamily the Case-I capstone `hglue_of_realization` needs:
each transversal hinge of a rigid block contributes exactly `D − 1` independent rows of `R(G,p)`,
all routed through the same `screwDiff u v`. -/

/-- **A rigidity row that vanishes off body `v`'s column factors through that column** (the pure
linear-algebra core of KT eq.~(6.28); Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1, Phase 22d). The candidate-%
completion row operation of eq.~(6.24)–(6.28) reduces the $(vb)i^*$-row of $R(G, p_1)$ to a row
whose $V \setminus \{v\}$ part is *all zero* — by definition, a functional `f` on the screw
assignments `α → ScrewSpace k` that vanishes on every assignment supported off `v` (`S v = 0 ⟹
f S = 0`). This lemma is the formal content of "such a row is determined by its `v`-column": writing
`S = Pi.single v (S v) + (S - Pi.single v (S v))`, the second summand is supported off `v` so `f`
kills it, leaving `f S = f (Pi.single v (S v)) = (f ∘ single v) (S v)`. Hence
`f = (f ∘ₗ single v) ∘ₗ proj v` factors through body `v`'s screw column.

This is exactly the structural input the candidate-completion's block-triangular rank lift needs:
the row-operation output of eq.~(6.28) becomes a *pure `v`-column* row `(Σⱼ λ_{(ab)j} rⱼ(q(ab)), 0)`
(eq.~(6.29)'s `(vb)i^*`-row), which then joins the $va$-block in the pin-a-body new block of
`linearIndependent_sum_pinned_block` — lifting `v`'s column contribution from `D − 1` to `D`, the
missing `+1` that takes the stratum-1 brick `D(|V|−1) − 1` to full `D(|V|−1)`. -/

§6.4.1, eqs.~(6.14)–(6.15); Phase 22e). The change-of-variables automorphism on the screw
assignments `α → ScrewSpace k` that adds body `v`'s screw column to body `a`'s — modelled, since
the rigidity rows read relative screws `S u − S w`, as its *dual* substitution on the assignment:
`Φ S = Function.update S v (S v + S a)` (it is `col_a += col_v` acting on rows, equivalently
`row_v += row_a` on the column-vector `S`). It is a linear automorphism with inverse
`Φ⁻¹ S = Function.update S v (S v − S a)`; both directions need `v ≠ a` so that the update at `v`
leaves the `a`-coordinate fixed. A rank is invariant under this change of variables (precomposition
with a `≃ₗ`), so it certifies the candidate row's vanishing without changing any rank: it is the
device that makes the transported `(vb)i^*`-row `hingeRow v a ρ` (supported on *both* columns `v`
and `a`) into a pure `v`-column row in the operated frame — see `hingeRow_comp_columnOp_apply`. -/

/-- **The star independence bridge: rows from distinct hinges at a common body are jointly
independent** (`def:rigidity-matrix`, the Case-I cross-hinge `hindep` step). Fix a body `v` and a
family of distinct other endpoints `w : J → α` (`hw` injective, `hwv` each `w j ≠ v`) — a *star*
of edges all incident to `v`, the shape a rigid block pinned at `v` presents. If for each `j : J`
the hinge-row functionals `r j : Iⱼ → Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)` are linearly independent, then
the combined rigidity-row family `⟨j, i⟩ ↦ hingeRow (w j) v (r j i)` over the disjoint union
`Σ j, Iⱼ` is linearly independent on `α → ScrewSpace k`.

This is the cross-hinge step the per-edge brick `exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_edge` does not
cover: rows from *different* hinges go through *different* relative-screw evaluations
`screwDiff (w j) v`, so `linearIndependent_hingeRow`'s single-edge dual-map argument no longer
applies. The independence is instead the *pin-a-body* / disjoint-support count: evaluating a
vanishing combination at the screw assignment `Function.update 0 (w k) x` (place `x` on the body
`w k`, `0` elsewhere — legitimate since `w k ≠ v` and the `w j` are distinct) collapses it to
`∑ i, c⟨k,i⟩ • (r k i) x = 0` for all `x`, so per-hinge independence
(`Fintype.linearIndependent_iff` on `r k`) forces every coefficient at `k` to vanish. This is the
joint independence of the rigid block's hinge rows that `hglue_of_realization`'s `hindep` consumes
— each of the block's transversal hinges contributing its `D − 1` rows
(`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_edge`), the rows of distinct hinges jointly independent because
they live on disjoint body-coordinate blocks once the common body is pinned. -/

rows carried by the re-inserted body `v`'s incident hinges, and an *old* block `ro` of rows of the

alone (`Function.update 0 v x`) reads the old rows as `0` (their edges avoid `v`, `hold`) while
reading the new rows through `v`'s screw column (`rn i ∘ₗ LinearMap.single ℝ _ v`). So if the new
rows are independent *as functionals of `v`'s screw* (`hnewpin`, the $D-1$ column-block rows of

/-- **The candidate-completion full block assembly: the operated augment transports back to the
original `D(|V|−1)`-size family** (`lem:case-III-candidate-row`, KT eqs.~(6.14)–(6.16), (6.29);
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1, the candidate-completion's column-operated block-triangular `+1`,
Phase 22e). The producer that takes the stratum-1 brick's two blocks (`rn` the new `va`-block, `ro`
the old split-off block) plus the candidate row `w = hingeRow v a ρ` (supported on *both* columns
`v` and `a`) and assembles them into one linearly independent family
`Sum.elim (Sum.elim rn (fun _ : Unit => w)) ro` — the original (un-operated) rows of `R(G, p_1)`,
the missing `+1` lifting the brick's `D(|V|−1) − 1` to full `D(|V|−1)`.

The argument is KT's column operation `Φ = columnOp hva` (`col_a += col_v`, eqs.~(6.14)–(6.15)).
Precomposing the whole family with `Φ` (a linear automorphism, hence preserving independence via the
dual equivalence `Φ.dualMap`) turns it into the *operated* family
`Sum.elim (Sum.elim (rn ·∘ₗ Φ) (w ∘ₗ Φ)) (ro ·∘ₗ Φ)`, in which the candidate row `w ∘ₗ Φ` is a
**pure `v`-column** row (`hingeRow_comp_columnOp_vanish_off`, eq.~(6.28)): it joins the new block in
the pin-a-body augment (`linearIndependent_sum_pinned_block_augment`) rather than needing the
old-block vanishing. The old rows are unchanged by `Φ` *at the pin assignment* `update 0 v x` —
since `Φ` only modifies column `v` and `Φ (update 0 v x) = update 0 v x` (using `v ≠ a`, so column
`a` reads `0`), `(ro_j ∘ₗ Φ)(update 0 v x) = ro_j (update 0 v x) = 0` (`holdop` from `hold`); the
new rows' `v`-column pins are unchanged. So the operated family meets the augment's hypotheses,
with the eq.~(6.29) top-left `D × D` full rank `hnewpinaug` (the `va`-block's `D − 1` pinned rows
plus the operated `w`'s `v`-column) the **conditional** = Claim~6.12 territory, passed through. The
operated family's independence transports back through `Φ.dualMap` (injective) to give the original
family's independence. -/

and the `ac`-sum, with restriction `rAC := ∑_j λ_{(ac)j} r_j(q(ac))`. Hence
`0 = g.comp (single a) = r̂ + rAC`, i.e.\ KT's eq.~(6.44)
\[ r̂ \;=\; -\,\mathrm{rAC} \;=\; -\sum_j λ_{(ac)j}\, r_j(q(ac)). \]
The `M₃` candidate's full-rank criterion is `rAC ∉ (\operatorname{span} C(L''))^\perp`
(`lem:case-III-claim612-p3-placement`); eq.~(6.44) rewrites it as `r̂ ⊥ C(L'')` --- the same common
vector `r̂` the `M₁/M₂` criteria use, which is exactly what lets the Claim-6.12 capstone
(`lem:case-III-claim612`) force the *single* `r̂` orthogonal to all of `C(L), C(L'), C(L'')` and so
to a spanning set, contradicting `r̂ ≠ 0`.

Stated abstractly (graph-free, matching the candidate-completion chain): the `ab`-sum and `ac`-sum
are explicit `hingeRow`-sums out of the common tail body `a` (into the distinct bodies `b`, `c`),
and `grest` is the remaining edges' contribution, which the degree-2-at-`a` fact (`hrest`: every
such edge is incident to neither endpoint at `a`) makes vanish on `a`'s column. The conclusion is
the `M₃` row `rAC := ∑_j λac_j • rac_j` equal to `-r̂` with `r̂ := ∑_j λab_j • rab_j`. The `ab`/`ac`
column restrictions are computed by `hingeRow_comp_single_tail`; the `grest` one by
`hingeRow_comp_single_off`. -/

/-- **Claim 6.12 — at least one of `M₁, M₂, M₃` has full rank** (`lem:case-III-claim612`,
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1, Claim 6.12, eqs. (6.30)–(6.45); Phase 22e, **green-modulo-N3b**). The
capstone of the `D`-candidate disjunction at `d = 3`. The candidate-completion
(`linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow`) lifts a single degenerate placement to full rank
`D(|V|−1)` *provided* its top-left `D × D` block is full rank, equivalently (the row-space criterion
`linearIndependent_sumElim_candidateRow_iff` at the candidate's hinge) the common candidate row
`r̂ := ∑_j λ_{(ab)j} r_j(q(ab))` is **not** orthogonal to that block's supporting extensor `Cₘ`. At
`d = 3` a single placement may fail, so Claim 6.12 is the three-way disjunction: for the three
candidates `p₁/p₂/p₃` (split at `v` along `va` / `vb`, and at the other degree-2 body `a` along
`ac`, routed onto the *same* `r̂` by eq. (6.44), `candidateRow_ac_eq_neg`), at least one of
`r̂(C₁) ≠ 0 ∨ r̂(C₂) ≠ 0 ∨ r̂(C₃) ≠ 0` holds — exactly the conditional `hr` the three producers
(`linearIndependent_sum_p2_candidateRow` for `M₂`, the analogous `M₃` form, and the
candidate-completion assembly for `M₁`) consume, discharging the candidate-completion conditional
`lem:case-III-eq629-conditional`.

The argument is a clean contrapositive: if all three blocks fail, then `r̂(C₁) = r̂(C₂) = r̂(C₃)
= 0`, so by the **point-join ↔ panel-meet duality** (`lem:case-III-claim612-line-in-panel-union`,
N3b, deferred to Phase 22f) `r̂` annihilates each of the six panel-support `2`-extensors
`pᵢ ∨ pⱼ = omitTwoExtensor (homogenize ∘ p)` of the four affinely-independent points
`p` of KT eq. (6.45) (`exists_affineIndependent_panel_incidence`, N3a). But those six joins **span**
`ScrewSpace 2 = ⋀²ℝ⁴` (`span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top`, N1, via Lemma 2.1), so a functional
annihilating them is `0` (`eq_zero_of_annihilates_span_top`, N2) — contradicting `r̂ ≠ 0`
(`candidateRow_ne_zero`, N5).

**Green-modulo-N3b** (honesty-gate case (b)): the N3b duality — the implication carried here as the
hypothesis `hduality`, "if `r̂` is orthogonal to the three supporting extensors `C₁, C₂, C₃` then it
annihilates every spanning join `pᵢ ∨ pⱼ`" — is the conclusion of the still-red N3b node
(`lem:case-III-claim612-line-in-panel-union`), whose exterior-algebra assembly lands in Phase 22f.
Its three operational leaves are green (`Meet.lean`); only the bounded `⋀²ℝ⁴` Hodge-star assembly
placing both `pᵢ∨pⱼ` and `C(L)` in `⋀²W` remains. The remaining steps (N1, N2, N3a) are green and
used here directly. -/

/-- **The candidate-completion conditional: at least one of the three candidate placements'
top-left `D × D` blocks is full rank, so at least one candidate family is independent**
(`lem:case-III-eq629-conditional`, KT eqs.~(6.29)/(6.30)/(6.41) + Claim~6.12; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
§6.4.1, Phase 22g). The conditional that the candidate-completion assembly
(`linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow`, `lem:case-III-candidate-row`) passes through —
discharged by the `D`-candidate disjunction of Claim~6.12 (`case_III_claim612`,
`lem:case-III-claim612`).

At `d = 3` a *single* degenerate placement need not have a full-rank top-left block, so the
conditional is the **three-way disjunction**: for the three candidate placements `p₁/p₂/p₃` (split
at `v` along `va`/`vb`, and at the other degree-2 body `a` along `ac`), at least one yields a
linearly independent full `D(|V|−1)`-size panel-row family. Each candidate's full-family
independence `famᵢ` is conditioned, via the row-space criterion
(`linearIndependent_sumElim_candidateRow_iff` threaded through the per-candidate producers
`linearIndependent_sum_p2_candidateRow` / `linearIndependent_sum_p3_candidateRow` /
`linearIndependent_sum_augment_candidateRow`), on the common candidate vector
`r̂ := ∑_j λ_{(ab)j} r_j(q(ab))` being **not** orthogonal to that block's supporting extensor `Cᵢ`
(`hsel₁`/`hsel₂`/`hsel₃`); the `M₃` candidate is routed onto the *same* `r̂` by eq.~(6.44)
(`candidateRow_ac_eq_neg`). Claim~6.12 (`case_III_claim612`) supplies the disjunction
`r̂(C₁) ≠ 0 ∨ r̂(C₂) ≠ 0 ∨ r̂(C₃) ≠ 0` — at `d = 3`, contrapositively, all three failing would put
the nonzero `r̂` orthogonal to a spanning set of panel-meet extensors of four affinely-independent
points (`hduality` + `span_omitTwoExtensor_eq_top`), forcing `r̂ = 0`. So at least one selector
condition `r̂(Cᵢ) ≠ 0` holds, discharging the corresponding candidate's conditional and giving an
independent full family. This is the selection step the `d = 3` `hsplit` producer instantiates at
real graph data (where each `famᵢ` is the actual eq.~(6.29) candidate family on
`ofNormals G ends q₀`). -/

/-- **Cross-hinge independence over a rigid block of edges spanning many bodies**
(`def:rigidity-matrix`, the Case-I `hindep` step in its general form). The multi-body
generalization of `linearIndependent_hingeRow_star`: where the star fixes one common body `v`,
here each hinge `j : J` is oriented from a *private endpoint* `u j` — the "child" vertex of a
spanning forest of the rigid block, so the `u j` are distinct (`hu` injective) — to an arbitrary
*other endpoint* `other j`, subject only to the **forest separation** hypothesis `hsep`: no
other-endpoint of any hinge is the private endpoint of any hinge (`other j ≠ u j'` for all
`j, j'`; in particular `u j ≠ other j`). If for each `j` the hinge-row functionals
`r j : Iⱼ → Module.Dual ℝ (ScrewSpace k)` are linearly independent, the combined rigidity-row
family `⟨j, i⟩ ↦ hingeRow (u j) (other j) (r j i)` over `Σ j, Iⱼ` is linearly independent on
`α → ScrewSpace k`.

This is the cross-hinge step a genuine rigid block — a spanning tree / forest of the contracted
block, hinges spanning *multiple* bodies rather than a single pinned `v` — presents to
`hglue_of_realization`'s `hindep`. The star (`linearIndependent_hingeRow_star`) is the special
case `u = w`, `other = const v`: there `hsep` is `w j' ≠ v`, here it is the forest property that
each hinge has a private child vertex incident to no other hinge of the block. The proof is the
same *pin-a-body* / disjoint-support count, pinning the private endpoint `u j₀` rather than the
common body: evaluating a vanishing combination at the screw assignment `Function.update 0 (u j₀)
x` reads `0` on every hinge `j ≠ j₀` (its private endpoint `u j ≠ u j₀` by injectivity, its other
endpoint `other j ≠ u j₀` by `hsep`) and `x` on hinge `j₀` (its other endpoint `other j₀ ≠ u j₀`
again by `hsep`), collapsing to `∑ i, c⟨j₀,i⟩ • (r j₀ i) x = 0` for all `x`, so per-hinge
independence forces every coefficient at `j₀` to vanish. -/

/-- **A rigid block's spanning forest of transversal hinges yields `(D−1)·|J|` independent
rigidity rows** (`def:rigidity-matrix`, the Case-I `hindep`/`hmatch` assembly in its general form).
This is the multi-body assembly the hand-off flagged: it combines the per-edge brick
`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_edge` (each transversal hinge contributing `D − 1 = screwDim
k − 1` independent rows through the same relative-screw evaluation `screwDiff (u j) (other j)`) with
the cross-hinge combination `linearIndependent_hingeRow_forest` (rows of *distinct* hinges jointly
independent by the pin-a-body count over the spanning forest).

Concretely, for a family of hinges `j : J` of a rigid block oriented along a spanning forest — each
edge `e j` linking a *private endpoint* `u j` (the forest child, so `u` injective) to an arbitrary
`other j`, with the forest-separation hypothesis `hsep : ∀ j j', other j ≠ u j'` and every hinge
transversal (`he : F.supportExtensor (e j) ≠ 0`) — there is a linearly independent family of
rigidity rows indexed by the disjoint union `Σ j, Fin (screwDim k − 1)`, all members of
`F.rigidityRows`. The index type has cardinality `|J|·(screwDim k − 1)` (`Nat.card_sigma`), so this
is the matching-size independent subfamily `s` the Case-I capstone `hglue_of_realization` consumes:
its `hindep` is the joint independence and its `hmatch` count is `|J|·(D − 1)`, matched against the
contraction's inductive rank. The per-edge block functionals `c j` (a basis of the
`(D−1)`-dimensional hinge-row block `r(p(e j))`, `finrank_hingeRowBlock`) are extracted by
`exists_linearIndependent_fin_of_finrank_eq`, fed to `linearIndependent_hingeRow_forest` for the

/-- **Two overlapping rigid pieces glue to a rigid union** (`def:rank-hypothesis`, the splice-glue
of Case I; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.2/6.5). If a framework is infinitesimally rigid on each of two
body sets `s` and `t` that share a body `c ∈ s ∩ t`, then it is rigid on their union `s ∪ t`:
every motion is constant on `s` and constant on `t`, and the two constants agree at the shared
body `c`, so the motion is constant across all of `s ∪ t`. This is the `α`-independent geometric
core of the Case-I block-triangular splice — the rigid subgraph `H` (on `s = V(H)`) and the rigid
contraction `G/E(H)` (on `t = V(G/E(H))`) overlap at the contracted body and cover `V(G)`, so a
framework realizing both pieces realizes the parent rank. -/

`d i ∈ span {c i}` with `∑ i, d i = 0`, then every `d i = 0`. This is the screw-space fact
behind Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 5.4 for a cycle of length `m`: around a cycle the relative-screw
differences `d i = S(vᵢ) − S(vᵢ₊₁)` lie in the one-dimensional hinge spans `span C(p(eᵢ))`
and telescope to `∑ d i = 0`, so independence of the `m` supporting extensors forces every
difference to vanish — the `m`-edge generalization of
`span_inf_span_eq_bot_of_linearIndependent` (the `m = 2` antiparallel case). Each `d i` is a
scalar multiple `aᵢ • c i` (`Submodule.mem_span_singleton`), and `∑ aᵢ • c i = 0` with the

/-- **Refining the hinge spans shrinks the motion space** (`lem:rank-rotation-semicont`,
Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 5.2, span/monotonicity form). If two body-hinge frameworks `F`, `F'`
share the same underlying multigraph and at every edge the constraint span of `F` is contained
in that of `F'` — i.e. `F'` is the *more general* (more constrained) realization, the generic
member of a rotation family — then every infinitesimal motion of `F'` is one of `F`:
`F'.infinitesimalMotions ≤ F.infinitesimalMotions`. The stronger (larger-span) constraints of
`F'` cut out a smaller null space.

This is the basis-free core of the lower-semicontinuity of `rank R(G,p)`: along a one-parameter
family rotating a panel, the generic realization has the *largest* supporting spans (the hinge
points in general position), hence the *smallest* motion space and the *largest* rank
(`finrank_infinitesimalMotions_le_of_span_le`). We carry it as this monotonicity-under-span-
refinement statement — matching the basis-free treatment of Lemmas 5.1/5.3 — rather than the
literal analytic one-parameter semicontinuity, which would force the parametrized
polynomial-entry coordinate matrix the design defers (the genericity-over-perturbation choice of
the risk register). -/

`finrank Z` only shrinks under refinement, `finrank_screwAssignment`). So the *generic* member of
