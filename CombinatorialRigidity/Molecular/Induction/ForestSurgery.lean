# The combinatorial induction — forest surgery and Theorem 4.9 (`sec:molecular-induction`)

Phase 20 (molecular-conjecture program; see `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). The capstone of the
`Induction/` subdirectory. On top of the contraction-minimality bridge (`Induction/Contraction`),
this file assembles Katoh–Tanigawa's Theorem 4.9 (Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §3.4–3.5, §4):

* the **acyclicity transport** across the degree-2 short-circuit, the fiber-degree substrate, and
  the degree-2 reroute (`lem:forest-surgery-split`, surgery crux);
* circuits of the multiplied splitting-off meet the short-circuit, and splitting-off preserves
  minimal `0`-dof (`splitOff_isMinimalKDof`, `lem:reduction-step`);
* **Theorem 4.9** (`minimal_kdof_reduction`, `thm:minimal-kdof-reduction`): every minimal
  `0`-dof-graph reduces to the two-vertex double edge;
* the repacking descent (`exists_balanced_forest_packing`) and the **forest-surgery** count and
  assembly (`forest_surgery_count` / `forest_surgery_split`, `lem:forest-surgery-count`; KT
  Lemma 4.1).

This file's `minimal_kdof_reduction` is what the algebraic induction
(`Molecular/AlgebraicInduction/`, Phase 21+) realizes at the rigidity-matrix rank. See

/-! ## Acyclicity transport across the short-circuit (`lem:forest-surgery-split`, surgery crux)

The genuine combinatorial crux of the Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1 forest surgery: the
reroute of the `D` forests across the degree-2 vertex `v` must **preserve acyclicity** —
each rerouted forest of the splitting-off `G_v^{ab}` is still a forest. The fibers of the
multiplied splitting-off `G̃_v^{ab}` split into the *fresh* short-circuit fiber `ã̃b =
edgeFiber e₀ n` (the `D-1` parallel copies of the new edge `e₀`) and the *surviving* fibers
(`p.1 ≠ e₀`), which are exactly the fibers of `G̃` whose underlying `G`-edge avoids `v`.

The surviving part transports cleanly: deleting the fresh fiber from `G̃_v^{ab}` gives a
subgraph of `G̃` (`mulTilde_splitOff_deleteFiber_le`), because every non-`e₀` link of the
splitting-off is a link of `G` (it keeps `G`'s `e ≠ e₀` links avoiding `v`). So a
cycle-matroid-acyclic fiber set of `G̃_v^{ab}` that avoids `ã̃b` is acyclic in `G̃`
(`isAcyclicSet_mulTilde_of_splitOff_of_disjoint`) — the half of the surgery's
acyclicity-preservation that needs no rerouting (the forests with `dᶠ(v) ≤ 1`, which drop
their `v`-edge rather than swap onto `ã̃b`). The rerouting half (`dᶠ(v) = 2` forests
swapping their two `v`-edges for one `ã̃b` copy, with the `v`-traversing path lift) is landed
as `isAcyclicSet_splitOff_reroute` below; what remains of the still-red
`lem:forest-surgery-split` is only the per-`D`-forest bookkeeping assembly. -/

/-- **Deleting the fresh fiber from the multiplied splitting-off lands inside `G̃`**
(`lem:forest-surgery-split`, surgery crux). The multiplied splitting-off `G̃_v^{ab}` with
its fresh short-circuit fiber `ã̃b = edgeFiber e₀ n` deleted is a subgraph of the multiplied
original `G̃ = (D-1)·G`. Every surviving fiber `p` (`p.1 ≠ e₀`) of `G̃_v^{ab}` is a copy of
an `e₀`-distinct edge of `G` avoiding `v`, so it carries exactly the same link in `G̃` — the
splitting-off only *adds* the fresh `e₀`-fiber and *removes* the `v`-incident fibers, both of
which lie outside the deleted-fiber subgraph. This is the structural fact the acyclicity
transport `isAcyclicSet_mulTilde_of_splitOff_of_disjoint` runs on. -/

/-- **The multiplied vertex-removal lands inside the multiplied splitting-off**
(`lem:forest-surgery-split`, surgery crux, reverse inclusion). The converse companion of
`mulTilde_splitOff_deleteFiber_le`: the multiplied vertex-removal `(G_v)̃ = ((G - v))̃` is a
subgraph of the multiplied splitting-off `G̃_v^{ab}`, *provided the short-circuit edge `e₀`
is fresh* (`e₀ ∉ E(G)`): `(G.removeVertex v).mulTilde n ≤ (G.splitOff v a b e₀).mulTilde n`.
Both graphs carry the vertex set `V(G) \ {v}`; every fiber `p` of `(G_v)̃` is a copy of an
edge of `G` avoiding `v` (`removeVertex_isLink`), and freshness forces `p.1 ≠ e₀`, so
`splitOff` keeps that very link (its first disjunct). This is the structural fact the
rerouting half of the surgery runs on: the part of a `G̃`-forest avoiding `v` (the forests
with `dᶠ(v) ≤ 1` reduced to `G_v`) transports verbatim into `G̃_v^{ab}` — only the
`v`-traversing tree-path of a `dᶠ(v) = 2` forest needs the `ã̃b` swap. -/

/-- **The surviving fibers of the multiplied splitting-off are exactly `E((G_v)̃)`**
(`lem:reduction-step`, splitting-off minimality transport; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemmas 4.7–4.8,
ground-set bridge). With the short-circuit edge `e₀` fresh (`e₀ ∉ E(G)`), the multiplied
splitting-off `G̃_v^{ab}` has ground set the disjoint union of the fresh short-circuit fiber
`ã̃b = edgeFiber e₀ n` and the surviving fibers, and the surviving fibers
(`E(G̃_v^{ab}) ∖ ã̃b`) are *precisely* the fibers of the multiplied vertex-removal
`(G_v)̃ = ((G − v))̃`:
`E((G_v^{ab}))̃ ∖ ã̃b = E((G_v))̃`.

This is the ground-set decomposition the by-hand base correspondence of KT 4.8 runs on:
splitting-off only *adds* the fresh `e₀`-fiber to and *removes* the two `v`-incident fibers
from `G̃`, so deleting the fresh fiber recovers exactly the `v`-free fibers — which are the
ground set of `M((G_v)̃)`. Sharpens the one-sided inclusions
`mulTilde_splitOff_deleteFiber_le` / `mulTilde_removeVertex_le_splitOff` to the edge-set
equality the base lift needs to identify the surviving matroid's ground set. The two `⊆`
directions are: a non-`e₀` fiber of `G̃_v^{ab}` carries a `v`-avoiding `G`-link (so its edge
lies in `E(G_v)`), and conversely a fiber of `(G_v)̃` is `v`-free with a fresh-distinct edge
(forced by `e₀ ∉ E(G)`), hence kept by `splitOff`'s first disjunct. -/

/-- **A forest of the multiplied vertex-removal is a forest of the multiplied splitting-off**
(`lem:forest-surgery-split`, surgery crux, reverse acyclicity transport; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
Lemma 4.1). The reverse companion of `isAcyclicSet_mulTilde_of_splitOff_of_disjoint`: any
cycle-matroid-acyclic fiber set `F` of the multiplied vertex-removal `(G_v)̃ = ((G - v))̃` is
acyclic in the multiplied splitting-off `G̃_v^{ab}`, whenever the short-circuit edge `e₀` is
fresh (`e₀ ∉ E(G)`):
`((G - v))̃.cycleMatroid.Indep F → ((G_v^{ab}))̃.cycleMatroid.Indep F`.

This is the half of the surgery's acyclicity-preservation that transports *into* `G̃_v^{ab}`
without rerouting: a forest of `G̃` reduced to the vertex-removal `G_v` (its `v`-edges
dropped) is a forest of `G̃_v^{ab}` verbatim, because deleting `v` strictly precedes the
short-circuit. No disjointness hypothesis is needed — `(G_v)̃` carries no `v`-incident fibers
at all, so it sits below `G̃_v^{ab}` unconditionally (`mulTilde_removeVertex_le_splitOff`); the
`v`-traversing tree-path that *does* need the `ã̃b` swap is the residual rerouting crux. -/

/-- **Acyclicity transports across the short-circuit** (`lem:forest-surgery-split`, surgery
crux; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1). A fiber set `F` that is cycle-matroid-independent
(acyclic) in the multiplied splitting-off `G̃_v^{ab}` and **disjoint from the fresh fiber**
`ã̃b = edgeFiber e₀ n` is acyclic in the multiplied original `G̃ = (D-1)·G`:
`(G̃_v^{ab}).cycleMatroid.Indep F → Disjoint F (edgeFiber e₀ n) → (G̃).cycleMatroid.Indep F`.

This is the half of the surgery's acyclicity-preservation that needs no rerouting — the
forests with `dᶠ(v) ≤ 1` at the degree-2 vertex `v`, which drop their single `v`-edge and
survive verbatim inside `G̃`. The transport routes through `mulTilde_splitOff_deleteFiber_le`
(deleting `ã̃b` from `G̃_v^{ab}` lands in `G̃`): `F`'s disjointness from `ã̃b` means `F` lives
in that deleted subgraph, where acyclicity is monotone up to `G̃` (`IsAcyclicSet.mono`,
`Graph.cycleMatroid_indep`). The rerouting half (the `dᶠ(v) = 2` forests swapping their two
`v`-edges for one `ã̃b` copy) is the residual crux of the still-red surgery. -/

/-! ## Degree of a vertex in a fiber set (`lem:forest-surgery-split`, degree substrate)

The forest surgery of Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1 reroutes the `D` edge-disjoint
forests `F₀, …, F_{D-1}` of an `M(G̃)`-independent set across a degree-2 vertex `v`.
Per forest `Fᵢ`, the reroute is driven by the **degree of `v` in `Fᵢ`** — the number
`dᶠ(v)` of fibers of `Fᵢ` incident to `v` in `G̃`. KT's surgery splits the forests by
`dᶠ(v) ∈ {0, 1, 2}` (a forest meeting `v` at `0` fibers is untouched; at `1` fiber its
`v`-edge is dropped; at `2` fibers its two `v`-edges are swapped for one `ãb` copy),
and the `< D − 1` short-circuit-copy count `h' ≤ D − 2` is read off these per-forest
degrees.

This subsection lands the **degree substrate** the surgery bottoms out on: the set of
fibers of `G̃` incident to `v` (`fiberAtVertex`), the reduction of `G̃`-incidence to
`G`-incidence at the underlying edge (`mulTilde_inc`), the per-fiber-set degree
`fiberDegree`, and the count `|fibers at v in E(G̃)| = (D − 1)·|incident G-edges at v|`
(`fiberAtVertex_inter_edgeSet_ncard`) — so a *degree-2* vertex `v` of `G` has exactly
`2(D − 1)` incident fibers, the quantity the `h' ≤ D − 2` bound is counted against. The
acyclicity-preserving reroute itself (a `G̃ᵥᵃᵇ`-cycle through `ãb` lifts to a
`v`-traversing path of `G̃`) is landed as `isAcyclicSet_splitOff_reroute` (reroute wiring
step 2); what remains of the still-red `lem:forest-surgery-split` is only the per-`D`-forest
bookkeeping assembly. -/

cycle-matroid-acyclic (forest) fiber set `F` of the multiplied graph `G̃ = (D-1)·G` and a
*fresh* short-circuit edge `e₀ ∉ E(G)`, the part of `F` avoiding the degree-2 vertex `v` —
`F ∖ fiberAtVertex v`, the fibers KT's surgery keeps untouched (`dᶠ(v) = 0` forests entirely,
and the surviving non-`v`-edges of the `dᶠ(v) ∈ {1,2}` forests) — is acyclic in the multiplied
splitting-off `G̃_v^{ab}`.

This is the half of KT 4.1's per-forest reroute that needs *no* `ã̃b` swap: every `v`-free
fiber `p` of `F` is a copy of a `v`-avoiding edge of `G`, hence a fiber of the multiplied
vertex-removal `(G_v)̃`. The `v`-free part is a subset of `F`, so acyclic in `G̃`; it lives in

`isAcyclicSet_mulTilde_splitOff_of_removeVertex` lifts that into `G̃_v^{ab}`. The residual

/-! ## At most one fresh copy per forest (`lem:forest-surgery-split`, reroute count substrate)

The rerouting half of the Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1 forest surgery swaps the two
`v`-edges of each `dᶠ(v) = 2` forest for a *single* fresh copy of the short-circuit fiber
`ã̃b = edgeFiber e₀ n`. The bound that makes the `< D - 1` short-circuit-copy count
(`h' ≤ D - 2`) go through is that **each rerouted forest absorbs at most one `ã̃b` copy**:
an acyclic fiber set of the multiplied splitting-off `G̃_v^{ab}` cannot contain two distinct
parallel copies of `e₀`, since two parallel copies of the same edge between distinct
endpoints `a ≠ b` form a 2-cycle. Aggregated across the `D` forests this caps the total
`ã̃b`-copy count at `D`, and the per-forest single-copy fact is what drives the reroute's
edge-disjointness bookkeeping (the residual rerouting transport itself — a `v`-traversing
tree-path lift — is the still-open crux). -/

/-! ## The degree-2 reroute preserves acyclicity (`lem:forest-surgery-split`, reroute wiring step 2)

The genuine combinatorial crux of the Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1 forest surgery: a balanced
forest `F` of `G̃` that uses **both** of its two `v`-edges (`dᶠ(v) = 2`: the `va`-copy `pa` and
the `vb`-copy `pb`) trades them for a single short-circuit copy `r` of the fresh edge `e₀`. The
rerouted forest `(F ∖ {pa, pb}) ∪ {r}` must stay acyclic in the multiplied splitting-off
`G̃_v^{ab}`.

The acyclicity rests on a **cycle-lift**: any cycle `C` of `G̃_v^{ab}` whose edges lie in
`(F ∖ {pa, pb}) ∪ {r}` lifts to a cyclic structure of `G̃` inside `F`, contradicting `F`'s
acyclicity. Two cases. If `C` avoids `r`, its edges lie in `F ∖ {pa, pb}` (so avoid the fresh
fiber), and deleting the fresh fiber from `G̃_v^{ab}` lands in `G̃`
(`mulTilde_splitOff_deleteFiber_le`), so `C` is already a cycle of `G̃` in `F`. If `C` uses `r` —
exactly once, as a trail has distinct edges — rotate `C` so `r` is its first edge,
`C = cons x r w'` with `{x, w'.first} = {a, b}`. The fresh edge `r` joins `a, b` in `G̃_v^{ab}`;
substituting the `v`-traversing 2-path `a —pa— v —pb— b` of `G̃` for `r` turns `C` into a closed
`G̃`-trail (the substituted `pa, pb ∉ E(w')`, distinct from each other and from `w'`'s edges), and
a closed trail contains a cycle (`IsTour.exists_isCyclicWalk`) whose edges are a sublist — hence
still inside `F = (F ∖ {pa, pb}) ∪ {pa, pb}`. Either way `F`
carries a `G̃`-cycle, contradiction. This is the last open wiring step; with it the per-forest
reroute map and the deficiency-relation assembly close `lem:forest-surgery-split`. -/

/-- **The degree-2 reroute preserves acyclicity** (`lem:forest-surgery-split`, reroute wiring
step 2; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1 p.660). Let `v` be a degree-2 vertex of `G` with distinct
neighbours `a ≠ b` (`a, b ≠ v`, `a, b ∈ V(G)`) and `e₀ ∉ E(G)` the fresh short-circuit edge. Let
`F` be a `(G̃).cycleMatroid`-independent (forest) fiber set whose two `v`-incident fibers are
exactly `pa` (a `v—a` copy) and `pb` (a `v—b` copy) — the `dᶠ(v) = 2` case of the surgery — and
let `r` be any copy of `e₀` (`r.1 = e₀`). Then the **rerouted forest** `(F ∖ {pa, pb}) ∪ {r}`,
obtained by swapping the two `v`-edges for the single short-circuit copy `r`, is acyclic in the
multiplied splitting-off `G̃_v^{ab}`:
`((G.splitOff v a b e₀).mulTilde n).cycleMatroid.Indep (insert r (F \ {pa, pb}))`.

This is the rerouting half of KT 4.1's per-forest acyclicity preservation — the half
`isAcyclicSet_splitOff_of_diff_fiberAtVertex` (reroute wiring step 1, the `v`-free part) does
*not* cover. The proof lifts a hypothetical `G̃_v^{ab}`-cycle through `r` to a `G̃`-cycle inside
`F` (substituting `r` by the 2-path through `v`), contradicting acyclicity; see the section
preamble. -/

/-! ## Circuits of the multiplied splitting-off meet the short-circuit (`lem:reduction-step`)

The conceptual heart of the splitting-off minimality transport (Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma
4.8(i), the claim labelled (4.10) in their proof). For a minimal `k`-dof-graph `G` with **no
proper rigid subgraph** and a degree-2 vertex `v` with neighbours `a, b` (`e₀ ∉ E(G)` fresh),
*every circuit `X` of the matroid `M(G̃_v^{ab})` of the splitting-off meets the fresh
short-circuit fiber* `ã̃b = edgeFiber e₀ n`.

This is KT's (4.10): if instead `X ∩ ã̃b = ∅`, then `X ⊆ E(G̃_v^{ab}) ∖ ã̃b = E(G̃_v) ⊆ E(G̃)`
(the ground-set bridge `edgeSet_mulTilde_splitOff_diff_fiber`), and since the two matroids
restrict identically to the surviving ground set `E(G̃_v)` (`matroidMG_restrict_mulTilde`
applied to `G̃_v ≤ G̃_v^{ab}` and to `G_v ≤ G`, both read off `Matroid.restrict_isCircuit_iff`),
`X` is also a circuit of `M(G̃)` — with `v ∉ V(X)`, since every fiber of `X` is a copy of a
`v`-avoiding edge of `G`. So `G[V(X)]` is a rigid subgraph (`circuit_induces_isRigidSubgraph`)
that is *proper* — it avoids `v`, and it spans at least two vertices because a circuit
contains an edge copy whose two `G`-ends are distinct (`[G.Loopless]`, the hypothesis the
`2 ≤ |V(H)|` conjunct of `IsProperRigidSubgraph` costs; the caller supplies it from
minimality via `loopless_of_isMinimalKDof`) — contradicting the no-proper-rigid hypothesis.

This is the matroidal claim the minimality transport `splitOff_isMinimalKDof` consumes: it is
exactly the statement that the surviving ground set `E(G̃_v)` is circuit-free, i.e. independent,
in `M(G̃_v^{ab})`. Katoh–Tanigawa use it to drive an iterated fundamental-circuit swap relocating
each `ã̃b` copy onto an `ẽ` copy; `splitOff_isMinimalKDof` instead consumes it directly, as the
fact that `E(G̃_v)` is a base of `M(G̃_v)` (so the swap induction is bypassed by a rank count).
Stated under no-proper-rigid plus looplessness — minimality of `G` itself is not needed
for (4.10); `[G.Loopless]` (which the caller derives from minimality) only feeds the
`2 ≤ |V(H)|` conjunct of the proper-rigid contradiction. -/

/-! ## Splitting-off preserves minimal `0`-dof (`lem:reduction-step`, splitting-off branch)

The full Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.8(i): splitting off a degree-2 vertex `v` of a minimal
`0`-dof-graph `G` with **no proper rigid subgraph** again yields a minimal `0`-dof-graph
`G_v^{ab}`. This is the splitting-off branch of `lem:reduction-step` (the contraction branch is
`contraction_isMinimalKDof`); paired with `lem:reduction-measure` it drives the `|V|`-induction
of Theorem 4.9.

**A clean counting argument replaces KT's iterated swap.** Katoh–Tanigawa prove minimality by
an iterated fundamental-circuit swap (their (4.10) + the `i = 1,…,h` loop) that relocates each
short-circuit copy `(ab)ᵢ` onto an `eᵢ ∈ ẽ`. We bypass the induction with a rank/cardinality
comparison through the green `def = corank` bridge `isBase_ncard_add_deficiency_eq`:

* the **0-dof half** (`def(G̃_v^{ab}) = 0`) is `dof_tracking`'s two-sided bound squeezed against
  `def(G̃) = 0` and `def ≥ 0`;
* the surviving ground set `E(G̃_v) = E(G̃_v^{ab}) ∖ ã̃b` is a **base of `M(G̃_v)`**: it is
  independent in `M(G̃_v^{ab})` (`circuit_splitOff_meets_fiber` — KT's (4.10) — says no circuit
  avoids `ã̃b`, i.e. `E(G̃_v)` is circuit-free), and restriction descends it to `M(G̃_v)`, where
  it is the whole ground set;
* KT 4.7 (`def(G̃_v) > 0`): `G_v ≤ G` is a proper subgraph on `|V(G)| − 1 ≥ 2` vertices (the
  `hV3 : 3 ≤ |V(G)|` hypothesis — the splitting branch's standing regime, and genuinely needed:
  at `|V(G)| = 2` the double edge splits to a one-vertex loop graph whose empty base misses the
  fresh fiber), so under no-proper-rigid it is not `0`-dof, hence `def(G̃_v) > 0`;
* finally, any base `B'` of `M(G̃_v^{ab})` avoiding a fiber `ẽ` (`e ∈ E(G_v^{ab})`) has
  `|B'| ≤ |E(G̃_v)|` (case `e = e₀`: `B' ⊆ E(G̃_v)`; case `e ≠ e₀`: `B'` splits into `B' ∩ ã̃b`
  of size `≤ D − 1` and `B' ∩ E(G̃_v) ⊆ E(G̃_v) ∖ ẽ` of size `≤ |E(G̃_v)| − (D − 1)`). Via
  `isBase_ncard_add_deficiency_eq` on the two bases this forces `def(G̃_v) ≤ def(G̃_v^{ab}) = 0`,
  contradicting `def(G̃_v) > 0`. So every base meets every fiber: `G_v^{ab}` is minimal. -/

/-! ## Theorem 4.9: reduction of minimal `0`-dof-graphs (`thm:minimal-kdof-reduction`)

The capstone of the combinatorial induction (Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Theorem 4.9). Every
minimal `0`-dof-graph with `2 ≤ |V|` reduces to the two-vertex double edge by a sequence
of two operations — splitting off a reducible degree-2 vertex, and contracting a proper
rigid subgraph — each of which (`lem:reduction-step`) carries a minimal `0`-dof-graph to a
strictly smaller one (`lem:reduction-measure`). Phrased as the well-founded induction
principle this dichotomy + measure drives: a motive closed under the two-vertex base case
and the two reductions holds of every minimal `0`-dof-graph.

The splitting-off step needs the degree-2 vertex's two incident edges as explicit data
(the `eₐ`/`e_b` encoding `splitOff_isMinimalKDof` consumes). The bridge
`exists_splitOff_data_of_degree_eq_two` extracts it: a degree-2 vertex of a `0`-dof-graph
has its two incidences carried by two *distinct nonloop* edges (the `0`-dof
two-edge-connectivity rules out a single loop, which would also give degree 2), whose far
endpoints supply `a`, `b`. -/

/-- **A degree-2 vertex of a `0`-dof-graph carries splitting-off data**
(`thm:minimal-kdof-reduction`, the degree↔edges bridge for the splitting-off step). For
`D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 1`, a `0`-dof-graph
`G`, and a vertex `v` of multigraph degree exactly `2` with a distinct companion `b₀ ∈ V(G)`
(needed only to invoke two-edge-connectivity), the two incidences at `v` are carried by two
*distinct nonloop* edges `eₐ ≠ e_b`: the count `degree v = 2·#loops + #nonloops` together with
`#nonloops ≥ 2` (two-edge-connectivity, `two_le_crossingEdges_of_isKDof_zero`, via the singleton
cut `{v}` whose crossing edges are the nonloops at `v`) forces `#loops = 0` and `#nonloops = 2`.
The two nonloop edges' far endpoints `a, b ≠ v` lie in `V(G)`, and every `v`-incident edge is one
of them (the closure `hdeg2`). This is exactly the `eₐ`/`e_b`/`a`/`b` data `splitOff_isMinimalKDof`
consumes. -/

/-! ### Chain data for the Case-III `d = 3` producer (G4a-ii, Phase 22h) -/

/-- **Chain data for the Case-III `d = 3` splitting producer** (G4a-ii, Phase 22h;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1). For a minimal `0`-dof-graph with no proper rigid subgraph,
`D ≥ 6` (the `d = 3` regime), and `4 ≤ |V(G)|`, there exist distinct vertices `v, a, b, c`
and edges `eₐ, e_b, e_c` forming the chain `b — v — a — c`:

* `G.IsLink eₐ v a` (the shared `va`-edge),
* `G.IsLink e_b v b` (the second `v`-edge),
* `G.IsLink e_c a c` (the second `a`-edge),
* the degree-2 closures: every `v`-edge is `eₐ` or `e_b`, every `a`-edge is `eₐ` or `e_c`,
* all distinctness: `a ≠ v`, `b ≠ v`, `b ≠ a`, `c ≠ v`, `c ≠ a`, `b ≠ c`,
  `eₐ ≠ e_b`, `eₐ ≠ e_c`.

Proof: apply `exists_adjacent_degree_two_pair` (G4a-i) to get `v, a` both of degree 2
adjacent via `eₐ`. Simplicity (`simple_of_isMinimalKDof_of_noRigid`, G0) then lets
`exists_splitOff_data_of_degree_eq_two` at `v` (resp. `a`) identify the two edges; the
shared `eₐ` pins `a` (resp. `v`) as the far endpoint, leaving `e_b, b` (resp. `e_c, c`).
The `b ≠ c` inequality follows from `triangle_isProperRigidSubgraph` + `hnp`: if `b = c`
then `G[{v, a, b}]` is a proper rigid subgraph of `G` (a triangle, `4 ≤ |V(G)|`). -/

/-- **Reduction of minimal `0`-dof-graphs** (`thm:minimal-kdof-reduction`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
Theorem 4.9). The combinatorial skeleton of the molecular conjecture's induction, phrased as the
well-founded induction principle that the reduction dichotomy + the vertex-count measure drive.

For `D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 3` (the molecular regime `n ≥ 2`), a motive `P` on graphs that

* holds for every minimal `0`-dof-graph on exactly two vertices (the two-vertex double edge,
  `hbase`),
* is reflected by splitting off a reducible degree-2 vertex — if `P` holds of the splitting-off
  `G_v^{ab}` then it holds of `G` (`hsplit`), and
* is reflected by contracting a proper rigid subgraph, given the induction hypothesis on every
  strictly-smaller minimal `0`-dof-graph (`hcontract`),

holds of every minimal `0`-dof-graph `G` with `2 ≤ |V(G)|`. The proof is the `|V|`-induction
(`lem:reduction-measure`): the base case `|V| = 2`; for `|V| ≥ 3`, either `G` has a proper rigid
subgraph — apply `hcontract` with the strong induction hypothesis — or it does not, in which case
`exists_degree_eq_two` (`lem:reducible-vertex`) supplies a degree-2 vertex,
`exists_splitOff_data_of_degree_eq_two` its two incident edges, and `splitOff_isMinimalKDof`
(`lem:reduction-step`) makes the splitting-off a strictly-smaller (`splitOff_vertexSet_ncard_lt`)
minimal `0`-dof-graph on which the induction hypothesis closes the `hsplit` premise.

The contraction branch is handed only the *existence* of a proper rigid subgraph together with
the strong induction hypothesis (rather than recursing on `rigidContract` internally): bridging
the matroid-side `contraction_isMinimalKDof` to a graph-level `(G.rigidContract H r).IsMinimalKDof`
is the graph↔matroid correspondence Phase 20 deliberately did not build (see `notes/Phase20.md`;
the Phase-21 N4 bridge `rigidContract_isMinimalKDof` has since closed it, and the Phase-22h
predicate repair makes proper rigid subgraphs span `≥ 2` vertices so the measure does drop —
the handed-IH shape stays because Case I genuinely consumes the IH at *two* objects, the block
and the contraction). The user discharges Case I from `H`. The splitting-off branch, fully
graph-level, recurses internally. The `hfresh` premise supplies an unused edge label for each
splitting-off (`splitOff` injects a fresh `e₀`); it holds whenever `β` is not exhausted by
`E(G)` — e.g. `β` infinite, or large relative to the edge count. This is the combinatorial
backbone the algebraic induction (Phases 21–23) realizes at the rigidity-matrix rank. -/

conditioned induction hypothesis** (all strictly-smaller minimal `0`-dof-graphs satisfy `P`)
rather than only the IH value at the specific splitting `G.splitOff v a b e₀`. This mirrors the
`hcontract` interface exactly, allowing the producer to re-choose its own degree-2 pair, extract
the adjacent-pair chain data (G4a), and apply the IH to whichever split it needs.

Requires no `hD`/`hfresh`/`[Finite β]` — the new `hsplit` makes no splitting internally;
`classical` handles the `by_cases` on the rigid-subgraph existence. (`[DecidableEq β]` is still
needed in the signature because `IsMinimalKDof` carries it.) -/

/-! ### The repacking descent: a base admits a balanced forest packing
(`lem:forest-surgery-split`, the balanced-packing descent — outer loop)

This closes the balanced-packing assumption Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1 (p.660) glosses
(`rem:kt-lemma-41`~(2)): **a base of `M(G̃)` admits a `D`-forest packing in which every one
of the `D` forests meets the degree-2 vertex `v`.** The two halves and their assembly step
are green: the counting half (`isBase_vfiber_ncard_ge`: a base meets `≥ D` of the `2(D−1)`
fibers at `v`), the redistribution kernel (`acyclicSet_insert_vfiber_of_not_inc`: a
`v`-avoiding forest absorbs a free `v`-fiber as a pendant), and one rebalancing move
(`exists_packing_move_of_not_inc`). This is the **outer loop** that iterates the move to
termination.

The descent runs on a *disjoint* forest packing (a genuine partition of the base `B`, not
merely a cover), obtained by `disjointed` from the `Matroid.union_indep_iff` cover
(`matroidMG_indep_iff_exists_forest_packing`). Disjointness is the device that handles the
caveat the cover form leaves open — when a `v`-fiber `x` is moved into a `v`-avoiding forest
`F_j`, it is removed from every *other* forest, and disjointness guarantees `x` belonged to
exactly one donor, so at most one forest can lose `v`-incidence. The pigeonhole then makes
the move strictly safe: if `F_j` avoids `v`, then the `≥ D` `v`-fibers of `B` are partitioned
among the other `≤ D − 1` forests, so some forest `F_i` (`i ≠ j`) holds `≥ 2` of them; moving
one to `F_j` leaves `F_i` still meeting `v` while `F_j` now meets `v`, strictly raising the
count of `v`-meeting forests. A strong induction on the count of `v`-avoiding forests
terminates with a balanced packing. Off the Theorem-4.9 critical path (the deficiency route
already delivered Theorem 4.9); this discharges the deferred surgery TODO's last piece. -/

/-- A `v`-fiber (a copy of `eₐ` or `e_b`) is incident to `v` in `G̃`, and conversely a fiber
of `E(G̃)` incident to `v` is a `v`-fiber, when `eₐ`, `e_b` are the only `v`-incident edges. -/

/-- **The repacking descent (outer loop): a base admits a balanced forest packing**
(`lem:forest-surgery-split`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1 p.660). For a base `B` of
`M(G̃)` at a degree-2 vertex `v` (with `eₐ`, `e_b` its only incident edges, `D ≥ 2`), there
is a `D`-forest packing of `B` — `D = bodyBarDim n` cycle-matroid-independent fiber sets
covering `B` — in which **every** forest meets `v`. This is the balanced packing Katoh–
Tanigawa's Lemma 4.1 base-case proof assumes without justification; it is achievable, so
the missing step is a *gap, not an error*.

Proof: disjointify the `Matroid.union_indep_iff` cover of the base
(`matroidMG_indep_iff_exists_forest_packing`) into a genuine partition, then run a strong
induction on the number of `v`-avoiding forests. The base meets `≥ D` `v`-fibers
(`isBase_vfiber_ncard_ge`); if some forest avoids `v`, the pigeonhole forces another forest
to hold `≥ 2` of them, and the rebalancing move (`exists_packing_move_of_not_inc`, recipient
acyclic via `acyclicSet_insert_vfiber_of_not_inc`) shifts one over, strictly raising the
count of `v`-meeting forests while preserving disjointness. -/

/-! ### The surgery count (`lem:forest-surgery-count`, Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 4.1)

The cardinality bookkeeping that the corrected forest surgery rests on. Starting from a
*balanced* edge-disjoint `D`-forest packing of a base `I` of `M(G̃)` — every forest meets the
degree-2 vertex `v` (`exists_balanced_forest_packing`) — reroute each forest across `v`:

* a `v`-degree-`2` forest (one `eₐ`-copy `pa`, one `e_b`-copy `pb`) drops `{pa, pb}` and adds a
  *single* short-circuit copy `r = (e₀, pa.2)` of `ã̃b` (via `isAcyclicSet_splitOff_reroute`);
* a `v`-degree-`1` forest drops its lone `v`-fiber and adds **nothing**
  (acyclicity: `isAcyclicSet_splitOff_of_diff_fiberAtVertex`).

Every forest has `v`-degree `1` or `2` — at least `1` by balance, at most `2` because two copies
of the same `v`-edge form a `2`-cycle (`fiber_inter_subsingleton_of_isAcyclicSet_mulTilde`,
applied to `eₐ` and `e_b` separately, the only two edges at the degree-2 vertex `v`). So **every**
forest shrinks by exactly one (`|F'ᵢ| + 1 = |Fᵢ|`), and as the packing partitions `I`, the
rerouted union satisfies `|⋃ F'ᵢ| + D = |I|`. This is precisely Katoh–Tanigawa's accounting
`2h' + (D − h') = h` — `h` fibers dropped, `h'` short-circuit copies added, net `−D` — handling
the `dᶠ(v) = 1` forests their proof glosses. The added copies are distinct across the degree-`2`
forests: `r i = (e₀, (pa i).2)`, and the `pa i` (distinct `eₐ`-copies in disjoint forests) have
distinct second coordinates, so `≤ D − 1` such copies are needed and `D − 1` exist. Off the
Theorem-4.9 critical path (the deficiency route already delivered Theorem 4.9). -/

/-- **The surgery count `|⋃ F'ᵢ| + D = |I|`** (`lem:forest-surgery-count`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
Lemma 4.1 p.660). Let `v` be a degree-2 vertex of `G` with distinct neighbours `a ≠ b`
(`a, b ≠ v ∈ V(G)`, incident edges exactly `eₐ ≠ e_b`), `e₀ ∉ E(G)` fresh, `D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 2`.
Given a *balanced* edge-disjoint `D`-forest packing `Fs` of a fiber set `I` — `⋃ Fs i = I`, each
`Fs i` acyclic in `G̃`, pairwise disjoint, and **every** forest meets `v`
(`exists_balanced_forest_packing`) — there is a rerouted family `Fs'` that is an edge-disjoint
`D`-forest packing of the multiplied splitting-off `G̃_v^{ab}` whose union is `M(G̃_v^{ab})`-indep
and satisfies
`(⋃ i, Fs' i).ncard + bodyBarDim n = I.ncard`.

This is the corrected construction (the superseded `forest_surgery_split` was vacuous and assumed
away the `dᶠ(v) = 1` forests): every forest shrinks by exactly one because a degree-`2` forest
loses two `v`-fibers and gains one `ã̃b`-copy while a degree-`1` forest loses one and gains none.

/-! ### The forest-surgery assembly (`lem:forest-surgery-split`, Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 4.1)

The deficiency read-off that closes the splitting-off forest surgery. Starting from a base `B`
of `M(G̃)` at a degree-2 vertex `v`, a *balanced* `D`-forest packing exists
(`exists_balanced_forest_packing`); rerouting it across `v` (`forest_surgery_count`) yields a
`D`-forest packing of the multiplied splitting-off `G̃_v^{ab}` covering an `M(G̃_v^{ab})`-indep set
`I'` of size `|B| − D`. Hence `rank M(G̃_v^{ab}) ≥ |B| − D = rank M(G̃) − D`, and the
def\,=\,corank identity (`rank_add_deficiency_eq`, against the `D(|V| − 1)` trivial-motion
ambient — and `G̃_v^{ab}` has one fewer vertex) reads off
`def(G̃_v^{ab}) ≤ def(G̃)`, KT 4.1's intended conclusion. This is the same bound the
deficiency-count route delivers green as `splitOff_deficiency_le`; the surgery is off the
Theorem-4.9 critical path (`rem:kt-lemma-41`). -/

/-- **Forest surgery at a degree-2 vertex, splitting-off direction** (`lem:forest-surgery-split`;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1 p.660). Let `v` be a degree-2 vertex of `G` with distinct
neighbours `a ≠ b` (`a, b ≠ v ∈ V(G)`), incident edges exactly `eₐ ≠ e_b`, `e₀ ∉ E(G)` fresh,
`D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 2`, `V(G)` nonempty. Rerouting a balanced forest packing of a base of `M(G̃)`
across `v` (`exists_balanced_forest_packing` + `forest_surgery_count`) produces a forest packing
of `G̃_v^{ab}` of size `|base| − D`, an independent set of `M(G̃_v^{ab})`. The def\,=\,corank
identity then gives
`def(G̃_v^{ab}) ≤ def(G̃)`,
KT's Lemma 4.1 conclusion — the same bound the deficiency-count route delivers as
`splitOff_deficiency_le`. This is the assembled repair of the balanced-packing gloss
(`rem:kt-lemma-41`~(2)): the corrected `forest_surgery_count` handles the `dᶠ(v) = 1` forests
(drop their lone `v`-fiber, add no `ã̃b`-copy) that the superseded vacuous over-claim assumed
away. Off the Theorem-4.9 critical path. -/

/-! ### The matroid-base 4.3(ii) form at `k = 0` (`lem:case-III-claim-6-11-base`)

Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.3(ii) at `k = 0` (the splitting-off matroid-base count; KT p.660),
the first missing-green prerequisite of KT Claim 6.11 (the `+1` redundant `ab`-row of §6.4.1;
`notes/Phase22d.md`). For a `0`-dof-graph `G` (`def(G̃) = 0`) with a degree-2 vertex `v`
(neighbours `a ≠ b`, incident edges exactly `eₐ ≠ e_b`, `e₀ ∉ E(G)` fresh), there is a **base**
`B'` of `M(G̃_v^{ab})` whose intersection with the short-circuit fiber `ã̃b = edgeFiber e₀ n` has
fewer than `D − 1 = bodyHingeMult n` copies — i.e. `ã̃b ⊄ B'`, so a redundant `ã̃b`-copy exists.

This is KT's own step-1 argument, run on the corrected forest surgery: rerouting a balanced
`D`-forest packing of a base of `M(G̃)` across `v` (`forest_surgery_count`) yields an
`M(G̃_v^{ab})`-independent set `I' = ⋃ Fs' i` with `|I'| + D = |base|` and `|I' ∩ ã̃b| < D − 1`
(KT Lemma 4.1's two conclusions). At `k = 0` the surgery's deficiency bound
(`splitOff_deficiency_le`, with `def ≥ 0`) gives `def(G̃_v^{ab}) = 0`, so
`rank M(G̃_v^{ab}) = D(|V \ {v}| − 1) = |base| − D = |I'|`; an independent set of full rank is a
base (`Indep.isBase_of_ncard`). That base `I'` carries the fiber bound. Needs `D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 2`
(so `G̃` has edge copies and the fiber `ã̃b` is nonempty). -/

/-! ### The Gap-3 combinatorial shell — `G − v` is a minimal `k'`-dof-graph with `k' ≤ D − 2`
(`lem:case-III-gap3-minimalKDof`)

The second factor of KT Claim 6.11's discharge (the `+1` redundant `ab`-row of §6.4.1;
`notes/Phase22d.md`), the *combinatorial* half of Katoh–Tanigawa 2011's nested-IH step
(KT p. 684–685, eq. (6.22) setup). With `G` a minimal `0`-dof-graph and `v` a degree-2
vertex, the vertex-removal `G_v := G − v = G_v^{ab} − ab` is itself a **minimal `k'`-dof-graph**
for `k' := def(G̃_v)`, and that deficiency is bounded by `0 ≤ k' ≤ D − 2`. The minimality is
KT Lemma 3.3 (`subgraph_minimality`, `G_v ≤ G`); the bound is the new content here, read off
the Gap-2 base.

The `k' ≤ D − 2` bound runs KT's own count on the Gap-2 base `B'` of `M(G̃_v^{ab})` with
`h := |ãb ∩ B'| < D − 1` (`splitOff_exists_base_inter_fiber_lt`): the surviving part
`B' ∖ ãb` lands in `E(G̃_v)` (`edgeSet_mulTilde_splitOff_diff_fiber`) and is independent in
`M(G̃_v) = M(G̃_v^{ab}) ↾ E(G̃_v)` (`matroidMG_restrict_mulTilde`, `G̃_v ≤ G̃_v^{ab}` via
`mulTilde_removeVertex_le_splitOff`), so
`rank M(G̃_v) ≥ |B' ∖ ãb| = |B'| − h`. At `k = 0` the splitting-off is itself `0`-dof
(`splitOff_deficiency_le` + nonneg), so `|B'| = D(|V ∖ v| − 1)`; with the def\,=\,corank
identity (`rank_add_deficiency_eq`, same vertex set `V(G) ∖ {v}`) this gives
`def(G̃_v) = D(|V ∖ v| − 1) − rank M(G̃_v) ≤ h < D − 1`, i.e. `≤ D − 2`. The lower bound
`0 ≤ def(G̃_v)` is `deficiency_nonneg` (`V(G_v)` is nonempty, containing `a`).

This is the green combinatorial shell of Gap 3: pure `M(G̃)` matroid theory, no rigidity
matrix. The eq. (6.22) *rank-at-the-fixed-seed* transfer it feeds — the genuinely-new analytic
kernel — is the next, deferred sub-phase (`notes/Phase22d.md` *Deferred sub-phases*). -/
