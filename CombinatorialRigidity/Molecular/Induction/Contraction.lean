# The combinatorial induction — contraction preserves minimality (`sec:molecular-induction`)

Phase 20 (molecular-conjecture program; see `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). On top of the
rigid-subgraph contraction `rigidContract` (`Induction/ReducibleVertex`), this file shows that
contracting a proper rigid subgraph preserves minimal `0`-dof-ness (Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §3–4):

* the cycle matroid under the vertex-collapse map (N4b) and the **simplicity** of a
  rigid-subgraph contraction (G2b);
* the union↔contraction crux (N4c), routed through the abstract matroid-union lemmas
  `Union_pow_isBasis'_split_of_rk_saturated` / `Union_pow_contract_eq_contract_of_rk_saturated`
  (the `namespace Matroid` block here);
* minimality transport along a contraction and the graph-level bridge
  `rigidContract_isMinimalKDof` (N4, `lem:rigidContract-isMinimalKDof`,
  `lem:contraction-minimality`).

The forest-surgery layer and Theorem 4.9 build on top in `ForestSurgery`. See `ROADMAP.md` §20 /
`notes/Phase20.md` and the `sec:molecular-induction` dep-graph.

/-! ## The cycle matroid under the vertex-collapse map (N4b; `lem:rigidContract-isMinimalKDof`)

The graph-side brick of the contraction-minimality bridge: edge multiplication commutes with
rigid-subgraph contraction, and — once the multiplied rigid subgraph `H̃` is preconnected
(`mulTilde_preconnected_of_isKDof_zero`, N4a) — the cycle matroid of the contracted multiplied
graph is the matroid contraction `(G̃).cycleMatroid ／ E(H̃)`. This is the per-cycle-matroid
step the `Matroid.Union` substrate of `matroidMG` is built on (N4c lifts it through the union).
-/

/-- **Edge multiplication commutes with rigid-subgraph contraction** (N4b graph-side brick):
`(G / E(H))̃ = G̃ / E(H̃)`, i.e. `(G.rigidContract H r).mulTilde n = (G.mulTilde n).rigidContract
(H.mulTilde n) r`. Both `deleteEdges` (lifted along the first projection) and the vertex-relabel
`map` commute with the `Fin (D-1)`-indexing of `edgeMultiply`, so multiplying the edges of the
delete-then-relabel contraction agrees with contracting the multiplied graph. The collapse map
`collapseTo r V(H)` is unchanged because `V(H̃) = V(H)`. This puts `mulTilde`-of-`rigidContract`
into the shape `cycleMatroid_contract` (vendored) is stated against. -/

/-- **The collapse map represents the connected components of a preconnected `H̃`** (N4b
brick): for a preconnected multiplied subgraph `H̃` with representative `r ∈ V(H)`, the
vertex-collapse `collapseTo r V(H)` is a representative function for `H̃`'s connectivity
partition. Outside `V(H̃) = V(H)` it is the identity; on `V(H)` it sends everything to `r`,
and preconnectedness makes `r` connected to each such vertex, so `collapseTo` respects the
single connected component. This is the hypothesis the vendored `cycleMatroid_contract`
demands; `mulTilde_preconnected_of_isKDof_zero` (N4a) supplies the preconnectedness. -/

/-- **Rigid-subgraph contraction as the direct vendored contraction** (N4b brick): the
delete-then-relabel `rigidContract G H r = (G ＼ E(H)).map (collapseTo r V(H))` *is* the
vendored `G /[E(H), collapseTo r V(H)]` (which expands to `(collapseTo r V(H) ''ᴳ G) ＼ E(H)`),
because the `map` commutes with the `＼ E(H)` (`map_deleteEdges_comm`). The shape
`cycleMatroid_contract` consumes directly — without the spurious inner `＼ E(H)` that the
delete-first phrasing `rigidContract_eq_contract` carries on the contracted matroid side. -/

/-! ## Simplicity of a rigid-subgraph contraction (G2b; `lem:case-I-realization`)

The combinatorial obligation behind the *generic* (general-position) inductive hypothesis of
Theorem 5.5's Case I: when does the contraction `G / E(H)` stay simple? Katoh–Tanigawa 2011's
Case I trifurcates on exactly this question (printed pp. 673, 676): Lemma 6.3 *assumes* a proper
rigid subgraph `H` with `G / E(H)` simple, while Lemma 6.5 handles the complementary case (no
such `H`) by a *degree-2 vertex removal* rather than a contraction. So the contraction can
genuinely fail to be simple — collapsing `V(H)` to one vertex can create a loop (an edge with
both ends in `V(H)`, but such edges lie in `E(H)` and are deleted) or a parallel pair (two edges
of `G ＼ E(H)` joining the same collapsed end-pair). The honest formalization therefore states a
*positive* `map`-simplicity criterion (`map_simple`, the genuinely new graph-theoretic content,
absent from the fork's `Simple` API) and specializes it to `rigidContract` (`rigidContract_simple`),
reducing `(G / E(H)).Simple` to two graph-side hypotheses on `G ＼ E(H)` under the collapse map —
the exact shape KT Lemma 6.3 supplies. -/

/-- **Vertex-relabel simplicity criterion** (G2b abstract kernel; the fork has no `map`-simplicity
lemma). The relabelled graph `f ''ᴳ G` is simple when (i) `f` never identifies the two ends of an
edge (`hloop`: no edge of `G` becomes a loop under `f`) and (ii) `f` never identifies two distinct
edges' end-pairs (`hpar`: edges with `f`-equal end-pairs are equal). Both are necessary: a `map`
can manufacture both loops (collapsing an edge's endpoints) and parallel edges (collapsing two
edges onto the same pair), which is why simplicity is *not* preserved by `map` unconditionally
(unlike `↾`/`＼`/`-`/induce, all subgraph operations with `Simple` instances in the fork). -/

/-- **Rigid-subgraph contraction stays simple under KT Lemma 6.3's hypotheses** (G2b; the
combinatorial fact feeding Theorem 5.5's *generic* Case-I inductive hypothesis). Specializing
`map_simple` to `rigidContract G H r = (G ＼ E(H)).map (collapseTo r V(H))`: the contraction is
simple provided

* `hloop` — no surviving edge has both collapsed ends equal: an edge `e ∈ E(G) ＼ E(H)` linking
  `x`,`y` never has `collapseTo r V(H) x = collapseTo r V(H) y`. Equivalently no surviving edge has
  *both* endpoints in `V(H)` (which would collapse to the loop `r`-`r`), nor links `r`-adjacent
  vertices that both land in `V(H)`;
* `hpar` — no two surviving edges collapse to the same end-pair.

These are KT Lemma 6.3's standing hypotheses ("`G` is simple and `G / E'` is simple", printed
p. 673) read off the realized graph; KT itself takes `G / E'` simple as a *case hypothesis*
(routing the failure to Lemma 6.5's vertex-removal), so this lemma is the faithful statement of
that case's combinatorial input rather than an unconditional preservation theorem. The
hypotheses are phrased on the surviving graph `G ＼ E(H)` directly (whose edge set is `E(G) ＼ E(H)`
by `edgeSet_rigidContract`); G2c discharges them from `H.IsProperRigidSubgraph G n` + `G.Simple`. -/

/-- **The cycle matroid of a contracted multiplied graph** (N4b, the per-cycle-matroid step;
`lem:rigidContract-isMinimalKDof`). For a subgraph `H ≤ G` whose multiplied graph `H̃` is
preconnected (`mulTilde_preconnected_of_isKDof_zero`, N4a) with representative `r ∈ V(H)`, the
cycle matroid of the multiplied rigid-subgraph contraction equals the matroid contraction:
`((G / E(H))̃).cycleMatroid = (G̃).cycleMatroid ／ E(H̃)`. This is the genuinely new content of
N4b — there is *no* vendored `cycleMatroid`-under-`map` lemma, so it must route through the
vendored `cycleMatroid_contract` (which contracts an edge set rather than relabelling vertices).
The bridge to `cycleMatroid_contract` is the commutation `mulTilde_rigidContract` (edge
multiplication commutes with contraction) plus `rigidContract_eq_contract'` (the contraction is
the vendored `G̃ /[E(H̃), collapseTo r V(H̃)]`), and its `IsRepFun` hypothesis is supplied by
`rigidContract_collapseTo_isRepFun` from N4a's preconnectedness. The result lifts through the
`Matroid.Union` of `matroidMG` in N4c (`ext_indep`). -/

/-! ## Isolating the union↔contraction crux of N4c (`lem:rigidContract-isMinimalKDof`)

N4c is the union-level independence bridge `M((G/E(H))̃) = M(G̃) ／ E(H̃)`, the genuinely hard
leaf flagged at Phase-22 launch: the `D`-fold `Matroid.Union` of `matroidMG` does **not**
commute with contraction in general (`Union Mᵢ ／ C ≠ Union (Mᵢ ／ C)`), so the per-cycle-matroid
contraction `cycleMatroid_mulTilde_rigidContract` (N4b) cannot push through the union directly.

The two bricks below reduce both sides of N4c to the **same restricted ground**
`S = E(G̃) \ E(H̃)` and rewrite each as a restriction of a `D`-fold-union construction over
`G̃.cycleMatroid`, isolating the irreducible crux to the single matroid equality
`Union (fun _ ↦ G̃.cycleMatroid ／ E(H̃)) ↾ S = (Union (fun _ ↦ G̃.cycleMatroid) ／ E(H̃)) ↾ S`
— union-of-contractions vs. contraction-of-union on the surviving fibers. That equality is
where the rigidity input bites: `E(H̃)` is the full edge set of the rigid (hence `D`-spanning-
tree-packing) `H̃`, so an `N`-basis of `E(H̃)` splits as one `G̃.cycleMatroid`-basis per factor,
the condition under which the union commutes with the contraction on `S`. See `notes/Phase22.md`
*Hand-off* for the remaining `ext_indep` + forest-packing argument the crux still needs. -/

/-- **The ground set of the multiplied rigid-subgraph contraction** (N4c brick): the multiplied
graph of `G.rigidContract H r` carries exactly the surviving fibers `E(G̃) \ E(H̃)`. The
rigid contraction deletes `E(H)` and vertex-relabels (a `map`, edge-preserving), so its edge
set is `E(G) \ E(H)`; multiplying lifts that fiberwise to `E(G̃) \ E(H̃)`
(`p ∈ E(K̃) ↔ p.1 ∈ E(G) \ E(H) ↔ p ∈ E(G̃) \ E(H̃)`). This is the common restricted ground
the two sides of N4c are matched on. -/

/-- **The contraction side of N4c reduces to a restricted contraction-of-union** (N4c brick).
For `H ≤ G`, the matroid contraction `M(G̃) ／ E(H̃)` is the `D`-fold cycle-matroid union of `G̃`,
*contracted* by `E(H̃)` and then restricted to the surviving fibers `E(G̃) \ E(H̃)`. Pure matroid
bookkeeping: `matroidMG G = N ↾ E(G̃)` with `N = Union (fun _ ↦ G̃.cycleMatroid)`, and the
restrict-then-contract commutes to contract-then-restrict because `E(H̃) ⊆ E(G̃)`
(`Matroid.restrict_contract_eq_contract_restrict`). Together with `matroidMG_rigidContract_eq`
(the matching union-of-contractions form for `M(K̃)`), this leaves N4c as the single
union↔contraction equality on `E(G̃) \ E(H̃)`; see the section docstring. -/

/-! ### The rank-saturated packing of the contracted-out set (N4c crux input)

The union↔contraction crux of N4c bites exactly where the contracted-out set `c = E(H̃)`
packs into `D` `G̃.cycleMatroid`-bases — the rigidity input. The abstract matroid fact behind
that packing: when the `k`-fold union `N = Union (fun _ : Fin k ↦ M)` *saturates* its rank
on `c` (`N.rk c = k · M.rk c`), an `N`-basis of `c` splits as `k` per-factor sets, each itself
an `M`-basis of `c`. (For the molecular crux `M = G̃.cycleMatroid`, `k = D`, and the saturation
`rk M(H̃) = D(|V(H)|−1) = D·(|V(H)|−1) = D·r_cyc(E(H̃))` is the Jackson–Jordán def=corank bridge
for a rigid `H`, since `H̃` is connected — `isBase_ncard_add_deficiency_eq` + N4a.) -/

/-- **A rank-saturated `k`-fold union commutes with contraction by the saturating set**
(the abstract N4c crux). For `M : Matroid α` on a finite ground with `[RankFinite M]`,
a set `C` on which the `k`-fold union `N := Matroid.Union (fun _ : Fin k ↦ M)` *saturates*
its rank (`N.rk C = k · M.rk C`), and any `I` disjoint from `C`, the two natural matroids
on `I` agree:
`(Matroid.Union (fun _ : Fin k ↦ M ／ C)).Indep I ↔ (N ／ C).Indep I`.
In general `Union Mᵢ ／ C ≠ Union (Mᵢ ／ C)`; equality of the independent sets holds *here*
because `C` saturates the union rank.

The proof is a rank-count argument, symmetric in both directions, avoiding the
matroid-union *matching* re-decomposition. Pick an `N`-basis `J'` of `C`; by saturation
`|J'| = N.rk C = k · M.rk C`. Both independence predicates expand to count conditions via
`Union_pow_indep_iff_count` (independence in a `k`-fold union ⟺ `|Y| ≤ k · r(Y)` on all
subsets), with `(N ／ C).Indep I ⟺ N.Indep (I ∪ J')` (`IsBasis'.contract_indep_iff`):
* **forward** (`Union (M ／ C)` ⟹ `N ／ C`): for `Z ⊆ I ∪ J'`, split `Z = Y ⊔ W`
  (`Y = Z ∩ I`, `W = Z \ I ⊆ J' ⊆ C`); the count on `Y` gives `|Y| ≤ k·(M.rk(Y∪C) − r_C)`,
  submodularity `r(Y∪W) + r_C ≥ r(Y∪C) + r(W)` (since `W ⊆ C`) and the count on `W ⊆ J'`
  (`J'` is `N`-independent) close `|Z| = |Y| + |W| ≤ k·M.rk Z`;
* **reverse** (`N ／ C` ⟹ `Union (M ／ C)`): for `Y ⊆ I`, the count on `Z := Y ∪ J'` gives
  `|Y| + k·r_C = |Y ∪ J'| ≤ k·M.rk(Y ∪ J') ≤ k·M.rk(Y ∪ C)` (monotonicity, `J' ⊆ C`), i.e.

/-! ### The rank-saturation specialization for a rigid subgraph (N4c crux input, II)

The abstract crux input `Matroid.Union_pow_isBasis'_split_of_rk_saturated` consumes a
rank-saturation hypothesis `N.rk c = k · M.rk c` on the contracted-out set `c = E(H̃)`. For
the molecular crux that hypothesis is supplied *here*, for a rigid subgraph `H` (`H.IsKDof n 0`):
the `D`-fold cycle-matroid union of `G̃` rank-saturates on `E(H̃)` because `H̃` is connected
(N4a `mulTilde_preconnected_of_isKDof_zero`), so `G̃.cycleMatroid` ranks `E(H̃)` at `|V(H)| − 1`,
and the Jackson–Jordán def=corank bridge (`isBase_ncard_add_deficiency_eq`, with
`def(H̃) = 0`) ranks `M(H̃)` — equivalently the union of `G̃.cycleMatroid` restricted to the
common ground `E(H̃)` — at `D(|V(H)| − 1) = D · (|V(H)| − 1)`. The two computations close the
saturation `N.rk E(H̃) = D · G̃.cycleMatroid.rk E(H̃)`. -/

/-- The cycle matroid of a multiplied subgraph is the restriction of the larger graph's cycle
matroid to its edge fibers: `H̃.cycleMatroid = G̃.cycleMatroid ↾ E(H̃)`, for `H ≤ G`. The
edge-relabel is a `≤`-monotone (`edgeMultiply_mono`) so `cycleMatroid_isRestriction_of_le` gives
the restriction; the ground sets pin the restriction set to `E(H̃)`. The bridge that lets a
cycle-matroid rank on `E(H̃)` be computed in either graph. -/

/-- **Rank saturation of the `D`-fold cycle-matroid union on a rigid subgraph's fibers**
(N4c crux input, II; `lem:rigidContract-isMinimalKDof`). For a rigid subgraph `H` of `G`
(`H.IsKDof n 0`, `H ≤ G`, `V(H) ≠ ∅`, `D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 2` so that `H̃` has edge copies),
the `D`-fold cycle-matroid union `N = Union (fun _ ↦ G̃.cycleMatroid)` *saturates* its rank on
the contracted-out fibers `E(H̃)`: `N.rk E(H̃) = D · G̃.cycleMatroid.rk E(H̃)`. This is the
hypothesis `Union_pow_isBasis'_split_of_rk_saturated` consumes; it bites exactly because `H̃` is
connected (N4a), so `r_cyc(E(H̃)) = |V(H)| − 1` and, by def=corank, `rk M(H̃) = D(|V(H)| − 1)`. -/

/-! ### The union↔contraction crux of N4c (`lem:rigidContract-isMinimalKDof`)

The genuinely-hard leaf of N4c, now closed. The two reduction bricks
(`matroidMG_rigidContract_eq`, `matroidMG_contract_eq_restrict`) put both sides of the
N4c identity over the common ground `S = E(G̃) \ E(H̃)`, leaving exactly the abstract
union↔contraction equality on `S`. That equality holds here — though `Union Mᵢ ／ C` and
`Union (Mᵢ ／ C)` differ in general — because the contracted-out `C = E(H̃)` is the full
edge set of the rigid `H̃`, on which the `D`-fold cycle-matroid union *saturates* its rank
(`union_cycleMatroid_rk_saturated_of_isKDof_zero`). The abstract
`Matroid.Union_pow_contract_eq_contract_of_rk_saturated` turns that saturation into
equality of independent sets, and `matroidMG_indep` lifts it to the graph-level
`matroidMG`. -/

/-- **The graph↔matroid contraction-minimality bridge** (N4c; `lem:rigidContract-isMinimalKDof`):
the matroid of the multiplied rigid-subgraph contraction is the matroid contraction,
`M((G/E(H))̃) = M(G̃) ／ E(H̃)`. For a rigid subgraph `H` of `G` (`H.IsKDof n 0`, `H ≤ G`,
`r ∈ V(H)`, `D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 2` so `H̃` has edge copies and is preconnected). Combines
the two reduction bricks — `matroidMG_rigidContract_eq` (the contracted side as a restricted
union-of-contractions) and `matroidMG_contract_eq_restrict` (the contraction side as a
restricted contraction-of-union) — with the union↔contraction crux closed by the abstract
`Matroid.Union_pow_contract_eq_contract_of_rk_saturated`, whose saturation hypothesis is the

/-! ## Minimality transport along a contraction (`lem:contraction-minimality`, second half)

The minimality-transport half of KT Lemma 3.5: contracting a (rigid) subgraph `H` of a
minimal `k`-dof-graph `G` leaves the minimality condition intact — every base of the
matroid contraction `M(G̃) / E(H̃)` meets every *surviving* edge-fiber `ẽ`
(`e ∈ E(G) \ E(H)`). This is the contraction analogue of `subgraph_minimality` (KT 3.3),
which transports minimality along a *restriction*; here the transport is along the
contraction, lifting a base `B'` of `M(G̃) / E(H̃)` to a base `B' ∪ J` of `M(G̃)` for an
`M(G̃)`-basis `J` of the contracted-out `E(H̃)` (`Matroid.IsBase.union_isBasis_of_contract`),
applying `G`'s minimality there, and pushing the fiber witness back to `B'` since the
basis part `J ⊆ E(H̃)` is disjoint from every surviving fiber. Stated on the matroid side
`M(G̃) / E(H̃)` — no graph↔matroid `map` correspondence. -/

/-- **A base of a matroid contraction lifts to a base of the matroid** (the abstract
matroid fact behind the contraction analogue of `subgraph_minimality`). For a base `B'`
of `M ／ C` and an `M`-basis `J` of `C` (`M.IsBasis' J C`), the union `B' ∪ J` is a base
of `M`. Via `IsBasis'.contract_eq_contract_delete` (`M ／ C = M ／ J ＼ (C \ J)`): the
deleted `C \ J` consists of loops of `M ／ J` (it lies in `closure J`), so a base `B'` of

/-- **Minimality transports along a contraction** (`lem:contraction-minimality`, second
half; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 3.5). For a subgraph `H` of a minimal `k`-dof-graph `G`,
every base `B'` of the matroid contraction `M(G̃) ／ E(H̃)` meets every *surviving*
edge-fiber `ẽ` of an edge `e ∈ E(G) \ E(H)`: `B' ∩ ẽ ≠ ∅`. This is the contraction
analogue of `subgraph_minimality` (KT 3.3, restriction transport). (No `H ≤ G` hypothesis
is needed: the argument is entirely on the matroid contraction `M(G̃) ／ E(H̃)`, using only
that the contracted-out fibers `E(H̃)` are the multiplied edges of `H` and the surviving
edge `e ∉ E(H)`; `H ≤ G` enters only the deficiency-conservation half.)

A base `B'` of `M(G̃) ／ E(H̃)` is disjoint from `E(H̃)` (it lies in the contraction's
ground `E(G̃) \ E(H̃)`). Picking an `M(G̃)`-basis `J` of `E(H̃)`, the union `B' ∪ J` is a
base of `M(G̃)` (`Matroid.IsBase.union_isBasis_of_contract`), so `G`'s minimality gives
`(B' ∪ J) ∩ ẽ ≠ ∅`. The surviving fiber `ẽ` (with `e ∉ E(H)`) is disjoint from `E(H̃) ⊇ J`
(`p ∈ E(H̃) ↔ p.1 ∈ E(H)`, but `p.1 = e ∉ E(H)`), so the witness lands in `B'`. -/

is needed** — both halves are stated against the matroid contraction `M(G̃) / E(H̃)`, and so
is the assembled conclusion: the matroid contraction is itself a *minimal `k`-dof matroid*,
i.e. it has corank `def(G̃)` at the reduced ambient `D(|V(G)| − |V(H)|)`
(`contract_matroidMG_deficiency_eq`, deficiency conservation) **and** every base of it meets
every surviving edge-fiber `ẽ` (`contract_minimality_transport`, minimality transport). This
is the Case-I engine of the algebraic induction (Phases 21–23). -/

/-- **Rigid-subgraph contraction preserves minimality** (`lem:contraction-minimality`;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 3.5, full form). For a *proper rigid* subgraph `H` of a minimal
`k`-dof-graph `G` (`hG : G.IsMinimalKDof n k`, `hH : H.IsProperRigidSubgraph G n`) with
`D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 1`, the matroid contraction `M(G̃) / E(H̃)` is a *minimal `k`-dof
matroid* at the reduced ambient `D(|V(G)| − |V(H)|)`:

* **deficiency conservation** — its corank at `D(|V(G)| − |V(H)|)` equals `def(G̃) = k`:
  `D(|V(G)| − |V(H)|) − rank(M(G̃) / E(H̃)) = k`;
* **minimality transport** — every base `B'` of `M(G̃) / E(H̃)` meets every surviving
  edge-fiber `ẽ` of an edge `e ∈ E(G) \ E(H)`: `B' ∩ ẽ ≠ ∅`.

The assembly is the conjunction of `contract_matroidMG_deficiency_eq` (rewriting its
`G.deficiency n` RHS to `k` via `hG.1`) and `contract_minimality_transport`. Stated on the
matroid side directly — no graph↔matroid `map` correspondence, matching how Katoh–Tanigawa's
proof reasons. This is the Case-I engine of the algebraic induction (Phases 21–23). -/

/-! ## The graph-level contraction-minimality bridge (N4; `lem:rigidContract-isMinimalKDof`)

The Case-I producer of the algebraic induction applies the strong induction hypothesis of
`thm:theorem-55` to the *graph* `G/E(H)`, so it needs `G/E(H)` to be itself a minimal
`0`-dof-graph. The matroid-side fact — the matroid contraction `M(G̃)/E(H̃)` is a minimal
`0`-dof *matroid* — is `contraction_isMinimalKDof`; what this node adds is the
**graph↔matroid bridge** that the matroid of the *graph* contraction `G/E(H)` *is* that
matroid contraction (`matroidMG_rigidContract_eq_contract`, N4c, green), plus the
**vertex-count reconciliation** that the reduced matroid ambient `D(|V(G)|−|V(H)|)` is exactly
`D(|V(G/E(H))|−1)` under the collapse-count `|V(G/E(H))| = |V(G)|−|V(H)|+1`
(`rigidContract_vertexSet_ncard`). The minimality half transports directly: an edge of
`G/E(H)` is a surviving `G`-edge (`edgeSet_rigidContract`), and a base of `K.matroidMG`
is a base of the contraction (N4c). The deficiency half runs the def=corank bridge on
`G/E(H)` against the conserved rank `rank(M(G̃)/E(H̃)) = D(|V(G)|−|V(H)|)`. -/

/-- **Graph-level minimality of the rigid-subgraph contraction** (`lem:rigidContract-isMinimalKDof`;
the graph↔matroid bridge of Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 3.5, graph form). Contracting a proper
rigid subgraph `H` of a minimal `k`-dof-graph `G` again yields a minimal `k`-dof-graph:
`G.IsMinimalKDof n k`, `H` proper rigid `⟹ (G.rigidContract H r).IsMinimalKDof n k`, under
`D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 2` (`[NeZero (bodyHingeMult n)]`) and `r ∈ V(H)`. This is the Case-I
producer's reduction step: it names `G/E(H)` and proves its minimality so the induction
hypothesis of `thm:theorem-55` applies, with the strict vertex drop from
`rigidContract_vertexSet_ncard_lt`.

The matroid contraction `M(G̃)/E(H̃)` is already a minimal `k`-dof matroid
(`contraction_isMinimalKDof`), and `matroidMG_rigidContract_eq_contract` (N4c) identifies it
with `M((G/E(H))̃)`. So the two halves of `IsMinimalKDof` transport: the base/fiber-meeting
condition reads each edge `e ∈ E(G/E(H)) = E(G) \ E(H)` as a surviving `G`-edge
(`edgeSet_rigidContract`); the deficiency `def((G/E(H))̃) = k` follows from the def=corank
bridge `rank_add_deficiency_eq` on `G/E(H)`, the conserved rank
`rank(M(G̃)/E(H̃)) = D(|V(G)|−|V(H)|)`, and the collapse vertex-count
`|V(G/E(H))| = |V(G)|−|V(H)|+1` (`rigidContract_vertexSet_ncard`). -/
