# The combinatorial induction: graph operations and Theorem 4.9 (`sec:molecular-induction`)

Phase 20, the fourth phase of the molecular-conjecture program (Phases 17–26; see
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). Where `Molecular/Deficiency.lean` (Phase 19) built the
matroid `M(G̃)`, the `D`-deficiency, and the `k`-dof hierarchy, this file develops the
graph operations that reduce a minimal `k`-dof-graph to the two-vertex double edge and
assembles them into Katoh–Tanigawa's Theorem 4.9 (Katoh–Tanigawa 2011,
*A proof of the molecular conjecture*, Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, §3.4–3.5, §4).

This file lands the `sec:molecular-induction` dep-graph in dependency order. The chapter
opens with two structural lemmas inherited from Phase 19's close, whose lower bounds the
def = corank bridge (`thm:def-eq-corank`) now unblocks. The leaf node landing here:

* `inducedSpan` (the **vertex-induced subgraph from a fiber set**): for a fiber set
  `X : Set (β × Fin (bodyHingeMult n))` of the multiplied graph `G̃ = (D-1)·G`, the
  vertex-induced subgraph `G[V(X)]` of the *original* graph `G` on the vertices `V(X)`
  spanned by `X` in `G̃`. Realized through mathlib's `Graph.induce` on the vertex set
  `(G.mulTilde n).spanningVerts X`; the def-eq-corank machinery (Phase 19) consumes its
  multiplied form `(G[V(X)])̃` via `mulTilde`.
* `circuit_induces_isTight` (`lem:circuit-induces-rigid`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 3.4,
  full form) — for a circuit `X` of `M(G̃)` and `e ∈ X`, the set `X − e` is `(D,D)`-tight
  on its vertex span: `|X − e| + D = D·|V(X)|`, equivalently `|X − e| = D(|V(X)| − 1)`. So
  `X − e` packs `D` edge-disjoint spanning trees on `V(X)` and `G[V(X)]` is rigid. The
  proof combines the upper bound — `X − e` independent ⟹ `(G̃ ↾ (X − e))` is `(D,D)`-sparse
  (Phase 19's `isSparse_diff_singleton_of_isCircuit`), giving `|X − e| ≤ D(|V(X−e)| − 1) ≤
  D(|V(X)| − 1)` — with the matching lower bound `|X| > D(|V(X)| − 1)`, forced by `X` being
  a circuit: every proper subset of `X` is independent, hence the sparsity failure of the
  dependent `X` is at `X` itself (`circuit_ncard_gt`).

`|X| > D(|V(X)| − 1)`. A circuit is a *minimal* dependent set: every proper subset is
independent, hence `(D,D)`-sparse, so the sparsity failure of the dependent `X` can only
occur at `X` itself. Concretely, picking any `e ∈ X`, the proper subset `X \ {e}` is
independent (`IsCircuit.diff_singleton_indep`) hence `(D,D)`-sparse, so if `X` itself also
satisfied the bound, every nonempty subset of `X` would, making `(G̃ ↾ X)` sparse and `X`
independent — contradicting that `X` is a circuit. -/

/-- **A circuit induces a rigid subgraph** (`lem:circuit-induces-rigid`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
Lemma 3.4, full form). Let `X` be a circuit of `M(G̃)` and `e ∈ X`. Then `X − e` is
`(D,D)`-tight on its vertex span `V(X)`: `|X − e| + D = D·|V(X)|`, equivalently
`|X − e| = D(|V(X)| − 1)`. Thus `X − e` packs `D` edge-disjoint spanning trees on `V(X)`
and the vertex-induced subgraph `G[V(X)]` is rigid (`0`-dof).

The upper bound `|X − e| + D ≤ D·|V(X)|`: `X − e` is independent

vertices, `spanningVerts (X − e) ⊆ spanningVerts X = V(X)`). The lower bound

/-! ## Forest-packing decomposition of `M(G̃)`-independent sets (`lem:forest-surgery-split`)

The matroidal substrate the Katoh–Tanigawa forest surgery (KT Lemmas 4.1/4.2) operates on.
`M(G̃)` is the `D`-fold union of the cycle matroid of `G̃` restricted to `E(G̃)`
(`def:matroid-MG`), so by the matroid-union characterization (`Matroid.union_indep_iff`,
Nash-Williams 1966 / Edmonds) an independent set `I` of `M(G̃)` is exactly one that decomposes into
`D = bodyBarDim n` cycle-matroid-independent fiber sets `F₀, …, F_{D-1}` — the **`D`
edge-disjoint forests on `V(G̃)`** of Katoh–Tanigawa's proof. This pins the **framing** of
the surgery (the open Phase-20 blocker): a "forest" of `G̃` is a cycle-matroid-independent
fiber set (mathlib `Matroid.Graph.cycleMatroid` independence = acyclicity), and the
`D`-forest partition is the `Matroid.union_indep_iff` decomposition — *no* hand-rolled
graph-theoretic acyclicity predicate is introduced. KT 4.1's surgery then reroutes each of
these `D` forests across the degree-2 vertex `v`. -/

/-- **Forest-packing decomposition of an `M(G̃)`-independent set** (`lem:forest-surgery-split`,
framing; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011, the "partition `I` into `D` edge-disjoint forests on `V`" step
opening the proofs of Lemmas 4.1/4.2). A fiber set `I ⊆ E(G̃)` is independent in `M(G̃)` iff it
is covered by `D = bodyBarDim n` cycle-matroid-independent fiber sets (the `D` edge-disjoint
forests of `G̃`): `∃ Fs : Fin D → Set _, ⋃ i, Fs i = I ∧ ∀ i, (G̃.cycleMatroid).Indep (Fs i)`.

This is the matroidal reading of "`I` partitions into `D` edge-disjoint forests": `M(G̃)` is the
`D`-fold cycle-matroid union restricted to `E(G̃)` (`def:matroid-MG`), so independence unfolds
through `Matroid.restrict_indep_iff` and `Matroid.union_indep_iff` (Nash-Williams 1966 /
Edmonds). It fixes
the framing of the Katoh–Tanigawa forest surgery: a "forest" is a `(G̃).cycleMatroid`-independent
fiber set, and the surgery of KT Lemma 4.1 reroutes each of these `D` forests across the
degree-2 vertex. -/

/-! ### Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 4.1 is over-quantified (`lem:forest-surgery-split`, off-path note)

Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1 (p.660; the 2009 arXiv predecessor Lemma 5.1, p.11) is
quantified "**for any** independent set `I` of `M(G̃)` … there exists `I'` … with
`|I'| = |I| − D`". As literally quantified over *all* independent `I` this is **false**:
for any `I` with `|I| < D` — e.g. `I = ∅` — it demands `|I'| = |I| − D < 0`, impossible.
The intended quantifier is over **bases** of `M(G̃)`; the universal form must be restricted.

We record the literal disproof as a one-line `example` (the `I = ∅`, ℕ-cardinality witness:
no `I'` can satisfy `|I'| + D = 0` because `D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 1`). This is a narrow
*statement-as-quantified* observation, **not** a refutation of KT's theorem: the molecular
conjecture and KT's proof stand. The intended (base-form) content the induction consumes —
the deficiency inequality `def(G̃ᵥᵃᵇ) ≤ def(G̃)` — is true and is established directly via
the deficiency-count route (`lem:splitoff-deficiency`), bypassing the forest surgery. A
separate, subtler gap (KT's base-case proof silently assumes a *balanced* `D`-forest packing
at the degree-2 vertex `v`, which we could neither justify nor recover) gates only the
deferred surgery TODO; see `notes/Phase20.md` *Finding* / *Replan*. The framing here is
deliberately "KT omits / we did not recover", never "KT errs". -/

/-- **KT Lemma 4.1's universal quantification over independent sets is not satisfiable**
(`lem:forest-surgery-split`, over-quantification note; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1 p.660 /
2009 arXiv Lemma 5.1 p.11). The lemma as stated promises, *for any* independent set `I` of
`M(G̃)`, an `I'` with `|I'| = |I| − D` (i.e. `|I'| + D = |I|`). Taking `I = ∅` (independent
in any matroid) makes the demand `|I'| + D = 0` in ℕ, which fails whenever `D = bodyBarDim n
≥ 1`. So the universal-over-`I` reading is formally false; the intended quantifier is over
*bases*. See the section docstring and `notes/Phase20.md` for the three-layer framing — this
is the *statement-as-quantified* layer only, not a refutation of KT's theorem. -/

/-! ## A rigid subgraph attains full rank (`lem:contraction-minimality`, rank core)

The matroidal arithmetic the rigid-subgraph contraction of KT Lemma 3.5 opens on: a
*rigid* subgraph `H` (`def(H̃) = 0`) has `rank M(H̃) = D(|V(H)| − 1)`, the maximal value
allowed by the rank upper bound. This is the `def = 0` reading of the def\,$=$\,corank
bridge (`thm:def-eq-corank`, Phase 19's `rank_add_deficiency_eq`): a `0`-dof graph's
multiplied form packs `D` edge-disjoint spanning trees on its `|V(H)|` vertices, exactly
`D(|V(H)| − 1)` edges. Contracting such an `H` removes precisely this rank from `M(G̃)`
and the matching `D(|V(H)| − 1)` from the ambient `D(|V| − 1)`, leaving the corank — hence
the deficiency — unchanged; that is the engine of Case I of the algebraic induction. -/

/-- **A rigid subgraph attains full rank** (`lem:contraction-minimality`, rank core;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 3.5, the rank-conservation fact its proof opens on). For a
rigid subgraph — `H.IsKDof n 0`, i.e. `def(H̃) = 0` — with `V(H).Nonempty` and
`D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 1`, the matroid `M(H̃)` has full rank `rank M(H̃) = D(|V(H)| − 1)`.

Immediate from the def\,$=$\,corank bridge `rank_add_deficiency_eq` (Phase 19) with the
deficiency `def(H̃) = 0` of the rigid hypothesis: `rank M(H̃) + 0 = D(|V(H)| − 1)`. This
is the rank quantity contraction of a rigid subgraph removes from both `rank M(G̃)` and
the ambient `D(|V| − 1)`, leaving the corank/deficiency unchanged (KT 3.5). -/

The graph↔matroid side of KT Lemma 3.5: contracting a rigid subgraph `H` removes exactly
`rank M(H̃) = D(|V(H)| − 1)` from `rank M(G̃)`. On the matroid this is the rank-conservation
identity for a contraction, `rank(M ／ C) + rank(M ↾ C) = rank M`, specialized to
`C = E(H̃)` via the restriction identity `M(G̃) ↾ E(H̃) = M(H̃)` (`matroidMG_restrict_mulTilde`,
Phase 19). The rank-conservation identity is the abstract matroid chain rule
`eRelRk C M.E + eRk C = eRk M.E` (`Matroid.eRelRk_add_eRk_eq`), read through
`(M ／ C).eRank = eRelRk C M.E` and `(M ↾ C).eRank = eRk C`; together with the rank core

/-! ## Contracting a rigid subgraph conserves the deficiency (`lem:contraction-minimality`)

The deficiency-conservation half of KT Lemma 3.5: contracting a *rigid* proper subgraph
`H` of `G` leaves the deficiency unchanged. Stated on the *matroid* side — against the
matroid contraction `M(G̃) / E(H̃)`, matching how KT's proof reasons — this is pure
bookkeeping over the two rank facts already in hand. Contracting `H` collapses `|V(H)|`
vertices to one, so the contraction lives over `|V(G)| − |V(H)| + 1` vertices and its
ambient trivial-motion count drops by `D(|V(H)| − 1)`; `lem:contract-rank-bridge` removes
the *matching* `rank M(H̃) = D(|V(H)| − 1)` (`lem:rigid-full-rank`) from the rank, so the
corank — hence the deficiency (`thm:def-eq-corank`) — is unchanged. The minimality-transport
half (every base of the contracted matroid meets every surviving edge-fiber) is the second
half of `lem:contraction-minimality`, scheduled next. -/

/-- **Contracting a rigid subgraph conserves the deficiency** (`lem:contraction-minimality`,
deficiency-conservation half; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 3.5). For a rigid subgraph
`H ≤ G` (`H.IsKDof n 0`) with `V(H).Nonempty` and `D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 1`, the corank of
the matroid contraction `M(G̃) / E(H̃)` at the *reduced* ambient `D(|V(G)| − |V(H)|)`
(the trivial-motion count of the contracted graph, which has `|V(G)| − |V(H)| + 1`
vertices) equals `def(G̃)`:
`D(|V(G)| − |V(H)|) − rank(M(G̃) / E(H̃)) = def(G̃)`.

Pure matroid bookkeeping over the two rank facts: `contract_matroidMG_rank`
(`rank(M(G̃)/E(H̃)) + rank M(H̃) = rank M(G̃)`) with the rank core
`rank_matroidMG_of_isKDof_zero` (`rank M(H̃) = D(|V(H)| − 1)`) gives
`rank(M(G̃)/E(H̃)) = rank M(G̃) − D(|V(H)| − 1)`; substituting into the def\,$=$\,corank
bridge `rank_add_deficiency_eq` (`rank M(G̃) + def(G̃) = D(|V(G)| − 1)`) and cancelling the
`D(|V(H)| − 1)` between the rank drop and the ambient drop leaves `def(G̃)`. No
graph↔matroid `map` correspondence is needed — the statement is against the matroid
contraction directly. -/

/-! ## Graph operations (`def:graph-operations`, `def:rigid-contraction`)

The four operations on `Graph α β` that drive the Katoh–Tanigawa induction
(`def:graph-operations`, `def:rigid-contraction`): vertex removal, splitting-off at
a degree-2 vertex, its inverse edge-splitting, and rigid-subgraph contraction. These
are graph-level constructions; their *deficiency* behaviour (the forest-surgery core,
KT 4.1–4.5) routes through the matroid `M(G̃)` of Phase 19 in later nodes. -/

/-! ## Minimality transport along a contraction (`lem:contraction-minimality`, second half)

The minimality-transport half of KT Lemma 3.5: contracting a (rigid) subgraph `H` of a
minimal `k`-dof-graph `G` leaves the minimality condition intact — every base of the
matroid contraction `M(G̃) / E(H̃)` meets every *surviving* edge-fiber `ẽ`
(`e ∈ E(G) \ E(H)`). This is the contraction analogue of `subgraph_minimality` (KT 3.3),
which transports minimality along a *restriction*; here the transport is along the
contraction, lifting a base `B'` of `M(G̃) / E(H̃)` to a base `B' ∪ J` of `M(G̃)` for an
`M(G̃)`-basis `J` of the contracted-out `E(H̃)` (`Matroid.IsBase.union_isBasis_of_contract`),
applying `G`'s minimality there, and pushing the fiber witness back to `B'` since the
basis part `J ⊆ E(H̃)` is disjoint from every surviving fiber. Stated on the matroid side
`M(G̃) / E(H̃)` — no graph↔matroid `map` correspondence. -/

/-- **A base of a matroid contraction lifts to a base of the matroid** (the abstract
matroid fact behind the contraction analogue of `subgraph_minimality`). For a base `B'`

of `M`. Via `IsBasis'.contract_eq_contract_delete` (`M ／ C = M ／ J ＼ (C \ J)`): the
deleted `C \ J` consists of loops of `M ／ J` (it lies in `closure J`), so a base `B'` of
`M ／ C` is a base of `M ／ J`, and `Indep.contract_isBase_iff` then gives `B' ∪ J` a base

half; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 3.5). For a subgraph `H` of a minimal `k`-dof-graph `G`,
every base `B'` of the matroid contraction `M(G̃) ／ E(H̃)` meets every *surviving*
edge-fiber `ẽ` of an edge `e ∈ E(G) \ E(H)`: `B' ∩ ẽ ≠ ∅`. This is the contraction
analogue of `subgraph_minimality` (KT 3.3, restriction transport). (No `H ≤ G` hypothesis
is needed: the argument is entirely on the matroid contraction `M(G̃) ／ E(H̃)`, using only
that the contracted-out fibers `E(H̃)` are the multiplied edges of `H` and the surviving
edge `e ∉ E(H)`; `H ≤ G` enters only the deficiency-conservation half.)

A base `B'` of `M(G̃) ／ E(H̃)` is disjoint from `E(H̃)` (it lies in the contraction's

base of `M(G̃)` (`Matroid.IsBase.union_isBasis_of_contract`), so `G`'s minimality gives

The full Katoh–Tanigawa Lemma 3.5: contracting a *proper rigid* subgraph `H` of a minimal
`k`-dof-graph `G` again yields a minimal `k`-dof-graph, with the deficiency unchanged. The
assembly packages the two halves already in hand. **No graph↔matroid `map` correspondence
is needed** — both halves are stated against the matroid contraction `M(G̃) / E(H̃)`, and so
is the assembled conclusion: the matroid contraction is itself a *minimal `k`-dof matroid*,
i.e. it has corank `def(G̃)` at the reduced ambient `D(|V(G)| − |V(H)|)`
(`contract_matroidMG_deficiency_eq`, deficiency conservation) **and** every base of it meets
every surviving edge-fiber `ẽ` (`contract_minimality_transport`, minimality transport). This
is the Case-I engine of the algebraic induction (Phases 21–23). -/

/-- **Rigid-subgraph contraction preserves minimality** (`lem:contraction-minimality`;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 3.5, full form). For a *proper rigid* subgraph `H` of a minimal
`k`-dof-graph `G` (`hG : G.IsMinimalKDof n k`, `hH : H.IsProperRigidSubgraph G n`) with
`D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 1`, the matroid contraction `M(G̃) / E(H̃)` is a *minimal `k`-dof
matroid* at the reduced ambient `D(|V(G)| − |V(H)|)`:

* **deficiency conservation** — its corank at `D(|V(G)| − |V(H)|)` equals `def(G̃) = k`:
  `D(|V(G)| − |V(H)|) − rank(M(G̃) / E(H̃)) = k`;

The assembly is the conjunction of `contract_matroidMG_deficiency_eq` (rewriting its

/-! ## Acyclicity transport across the short-circuit (`lem:forest-surgery-split`, surgery crux)

The genuine combinatorial crux of the Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1 forest surgery: the
reroute of the `D` forests across the degree-2 vertex `v` must **preserve acyclicity** —
each rerouted forest of the splitting-off `G_v^{ab}` is still a forest. The fibers of the
multiplied splitting-off `G̃_v^{ab}` split into the *fresh* short-circuit fiber `ã̃b =
edgeFiber e₀ n` (the `D-1` parallel copies of the new edge `e₀`) and the *surviving* fibers
(`p.1 ≠ e₀`), which are exactly the fibers of `G̃` whose underlying `G`-edge avoids `v`.

The surviving part transports cleanly: deleting the fresh fiber from `G̃_v^{ab}` gives a
subgraph of `G̃` (`mulTilde_splitOff_deleteFiber_le`), because every non-`e₀` link of the
splitting-off is a link of `G` (it keeps `G`'s `e ≠ e₀` links avoiding `v`). So a
cycle-matroid-acyclic fiber set of `G̃_v^{ab}` that avoids `ã̃b` is acyclic in `G̃`
(`isAcyclicSet_mulTilde_of_splitOff_of_disjoint`) — the half of the surgery's
acyclicity-preservation that needs no rerouting (the forests with `dᶠ(v) ≤ 1`, which drop
their `v`-edge rather than swap onto `ã̃b`). The rerouting half (`dᶠ(v) = 2` forests
swapping their two `v`-edges for one `ã̃b` copy, with the `v`-traversing path lift) remains
the residual crux of the still-red `lem:forest-surgery-split`. -/

an `e₀`-distinct edge of `G` avoiding `v`, so it carries exactly the same link in `G̃` — the
splitting-off only *adds* the fresh `e₀`-fiber and *removes* the `v`-incident fibers, both of
which lie outside the deleted-fiber subgraph. This is the structural fact the acyclicity

Both graphs carry the vertex set `V(G) \ {v}`; every fiber `p` of `(G_v)̃` is a copy of an
edge of `G` avoiding `v` (`removeVertex_isLink`), and freshness forces `p.1 ≠ e₀`, so
`splitOff` keeps that very link (its first disjunct). This is the structural fact the

with `dᶠ(v) ≤ 1` reduced to `G_v`) transports verbatim into `G̃_v^{ab}` — only the

/-! ## Degree of a vertex in a fiber set (`lem:forest-surgery-split`, degree substrate)

The forest surgery of Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1 reroutes the `D` edge-disjoint
forests `F₀, …, F_{D-1}` of an `M(G̃)`-independent set across a degree-2 vertex `v`.
Per forest `Fᵢ`, the reroute is driven by the **degree of `v` in `Fᵢ`** — the number
`dᶠ(v)` of fibers of `Fᵢ` incident to `v` in `G̃`. KT's surgery splits the forests by
`dᶠ(v) ∈ {0, 1, 2}` (a forest meeting `v` at `0` fibers is untouched; at `1` fiber its
`v`-edge is dropped; at `2` fibers its two `v`-edges are swapped for one `ãb` copy),
and the `< D − 1` short-circuit-copy count `h' ≤ D − 2` is read off these per-forest
degrees.

This subsection lands the **degree substrate** the surgery bottoms out on: the set of
fibers of `G̃` incident to `v` (`fiberAtVertex`), the reduction of `G̃`-incidence to
`G`-incidence at the underlying edge (`mulTilde_inc`), the per-fiber-set degree
`fiberDegree`, and the count `|fibers at v in E(G̃)| = (D − 1)·|incident G-edges at v|`
(`fiberAtVertex_inter_edgeSet_ncard`) — so a *degree-2* vertex `v` of `G` has exactly
`2(D − 1)` incident fibers, the quantity the `h' ≤ D − 2` bound is counted against. The
acyclicity-preserving reroute itself (a `G̃ᵥᵃᵇ`-cycle through `ãb` lifts to a
`v`-traversing path of `G̃`, via the `Matroid/Graph/AcyclicSet.lean` cycle
characterization) remains the residual crux of the still-red `lem:forest-surgery-split`. -/

/-! ## At most one fresh copy per forest (`lem:forest-surgery-split`, reroute count substrate)

The rerouting half of the Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 4.1 forest surgery swaps the two
`v`-edges of each `dᶠ(v) = 2` forest for a *single* fresh copy of the short-circuit fiber
`ã̃b = edgeFiber e₀ n`. The bound that makes the `< D - 1` short-circuit-copy count
(`h' ≤ D - 2`) go through is that **each rerouted forest absorbs at most one `ã̃b` copy**:
an acyclic fiber set of the multiplied splitting-off `G̃_v^{ab}` cannot contain two distinct
parallel copies of `e₀`, since two parallel copies of the same edge between distinct
endpoints `a ≠ b` form a 2-cycle. Aggregated across the `D` forests this caps the total
`ã̃b`-copy count at `D`, and the per-forest single-copy fact is what drives the reroute's
edge-disjointness bookkeeping (the residual rerouting transport itself — a `v`-traversing
tree-path lift — is the still-open crux). -/

its fresh edge `e₀`, any two distinct copies `p ≠ q` of `e₀` in the multiplied splitting-off
`G̃_v^{ab}` are a cycle-edge-set: `{p, q}` is `IsCycleSet` of `G̃_v^{ab}`. Both copies join
the same endpoints `a, b` (`splitOff`'s fresh-edge disjunct), so the length-2 closed walk
`a —p→ b —q→ a` is a cyclic walk. -/
