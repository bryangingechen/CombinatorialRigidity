# Grassmann–Cayley meet / projective-duality foundations (`sec:molecular-meet`)

Phase 21a, a prerequisite sub-phase of the algebraic induction (Phase 21), inserted by
the 2026-06-03 panel re-scope. Where Phase 17 (`Molecular/Extensor.lean`) built the
*join* (progressive product `∨ₑ`, the symbolic exterior product on
`ExteriorAlgebra ℝ (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)`) plus a coordinatized Plücker bridge, this file
builds the dual half — the *meet* (regressive product) and the projective-duality
dictionary it rests on — on the same concrete carrier. The meet is the device the
panel-coplanarity layer (DESIGN.md *Panel-hinge = hinge-coplanar body-hinge*), the
cycle-realization Lemma 5.4, and the Crapo–Whiteley projective invariance (Phase 25)
all consume; see `notes/Phase21a.md` for the deliverable plan and `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`
for the program-level placement.

The construction is metric-free: projective geometry needs no inner product, only the
top-power volume form (orientation). Deliverables, in dependency order
(`N = k+2`, `V = Fin (k+2) → ℝ`):

1. **`topEquiv`** (this commit) — the canonical top-power iso `⋀ᴺ V ≃ₗ ℝ`. The
   orientation through which the perfect wedge pairing lands in `ℝ`. Mirrored as the
   general fact `exteriorPower.topEquiv` (over any `CommRing`, on `Fin n → R`) under
   `Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/ExteriorPower/Basis.lean`; `screwAlgebraTopEquiv` below is the
   `N = k+2` specialization on the screw-algebra carrier.
2. `pairingDualEquiv : ⋀ʲ(V*) ≃ₗ (⋀ʲ V)*` — the projective-duality dictionary entry
   reused by Phase 25 (upgrade of mathlib's `exteriorPower.pairingDual` to an iso).
3. `complementIso : ⋀ʲ V ≃ₗ ⋀^(N−j) V` — from the perfect wedge pairing, shown
   nondegenerate. The genuinely new core.
4. `meet` (regressive product) + `meet_ne_zero_iff` and the geometric reading.

## Carrier

The full exterior algebra `ExteriorAlgebra ℝ (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)` of Phase 17 (the
`affineSubspaceExtensor` / join carrier). The top graded piece is
`⋀[ℝ]^(k+2) (Fin (k+2) → ℝ)`, free of rank `(k+2).choose (k+2) = 1`, hence
`≃ₗ ℝ` — the volume form.
