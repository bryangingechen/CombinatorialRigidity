# The algebraic induction — Case III: the interior-`hρe₀` relabel bridge (Phase 23c)

Phase 22/23 (molecular-conjecture program). Terminal file of the `CaseIII/Relabel/` subdirectory
(the Phase-23c split of `CaseIII/Relabel.lean`, `notes/Phase23c.md`). Carries the interior-`hρe₀`
relabel bridge of the honest geometry arm — the splice-perp crux
`baseRedundancy_perp_interior_reproduced_panel` (KT 2011 eq.~(6.66)) and the cycle-relabel widening
chain (`reproduced_panel_eq_splice_panel`, `interior_hρe₀_of_{splice_perp,widening,baseWidening}`)
that turns the shared base redundancy `ρ₀`'s perp into the interior arm's reproduced-slot `hρe₀`
slot. Consumed by the LIVE router branch `chainData_dispatch_interior` (`CaseIII/Realization`)
feeding the interior arm `chainData_interior_realization_hρGv`. Built on `Relabel/ChainColumn`; this
is the file `CaseIII/Realization` imports for the chain dispatch.

The dead `_aug`/override/(D-substitution) fork that previously lived here (the chain-arm closer
`case_III_arm_realization_chain`, the corner-data assembly, and the `ofNormals` (D-substitution)
tail) was retired in the Phase-23f close (`notes/Phase23-design.md` §(4.106), deletion GROUP 2);
the honest `k`-spine engine carries `d = 3` and the reshaped interior arm carries general `d`.

/-! ## The interior-`hρe₀` relabel bridge (Phase 23c §I.8.24(4.13); KT 2011 eq.~(6.66))

The honest interior arm `chainData_interior_realization_hρGv` (`CaseIII/Realization`) carries, at an
interior matched candidate `i` (`2 ≤ i`), the *reproduced-slot* annihilation
`hρe₀ : ρ₀ ⊥ panelSupportExtensor (qρ(a,·)) (qρ(b,·))` with `a = vtx i.succ`,
`b = vtx (i−1).castSucc` the two chain neighbours of the degree-2 split body `v = vtx i.castSucc`,
in candidate `i`'s relabelled seed `qρ = q ∘ shiftPerm i.castSucc` (KT eq.~(6.56)). These lemmas
DISSOLVE the prior Route-A-vs-Route-B routing question into a single splice-perp crux: the
`(a,b)` reproduced panel is, *under the cycle relabel*, the base-seed chain panel of the spliced
edge `edge i` (`vᵢ`-incident, the KT eq.~(6.66) splice). So the leaf reduces to the one
genuinely-new obligation `ρ₀ ⊥ (base-seed `edge i` splice panel)` (the un-landed
`baseRedundancy_perp_interior_reproduced_panel`, KT eq.~(6.66)'s redundancy carry across the
spliced body), and everything else is this pure-`shiftPerm`-algebra rewrite.

The seam was mis-pinned 3–4× by design prose; these lemmas are the compiler-checked replacement for
that adjudication (the original spike, Phase 23c §I.8.24(4.13)). -/

/-- **The reproduced-slot panel is the base-seed splice-edge panel, under the cycle relabel**
(Phase 23c §I.8.24(4.13); Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.2 eq.~(6.56) the candidate seed `qᵢ = q ∘ ρᵢ`,
eq.~(6.66) the spliced panel). At an interior candidate `i` (`2 ≤ i`) the consumer's reproduced
panel `panelSupportExtensor (qρ(vtx i.succ,·)) (qρ(vtx (i−1).castSucc,·))`, read at candidate `i`'s
relabelled seed `qρ = q ∘ shiftPerm i.castSucc`, equals the BASE-seed panel of the spliced chain
edge `edge i` — namely `panelSupportExtensor (q(vtx (i+1),·)) (q(vtx i,·))`. The two seed reads
cancel the cycle shift:

* `a = vtx i.succ` has index `i+1 > i`, *off* the cycle `[vtx 1, …, vtx i]`, so
  `shiftPerm i.castSucc` fixes it (`shiftPerm_apply_vtx_off`): `qρ(a,·) = q(vtx (i+1),·)`;
* `b = vtx (i−1).castSucc` has index `1 ≤ i−1 < i`, *interior* to the cycle, so
  `shiftPerm i.castSucc` sends it to its chain-successor `vtx i` (`shiftPerm_apply_interior`):
  `qρ(b,·) = q(vtx i,·)`.

This is the cycle generalization of the `d = 3` `M₃` arm's single-swap seed-coincidence
(`Relabel/Arm.lean`, `case_III_arm_realization_M3`'s `hqρv`/`hqρc`). Pure `shiftPerm`/`vtx`
algebra. -/

/-- **The splice-perp crux — the eq.~(6.66) redundancy carry to the spliced candidate edge**
(Phase 23c §I.8.24(4.13)/(4.16), THE conjecture-crux leaf; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.2 eq.~(6.66)).
The genuinely-new content of the interior-`hρe₀` leaf: the shared redundancy `ρ₀` annihilates the
base-seed panel of the spliced chain edge `edge i` — `panelSupportExtensor (q(vtx (i+1),·))
(q(vtx i,·))` — at an interior matched candidate `i` (`2 ≤ i < d`). This is exactly the `hsplice`
hypothesis `interior_hρe₀_of_splice_perp` (below) consumes; the cycle-relabel bridge then turns it
into the consumer's `hρe₀` slot.

**The carry "across `vᵢ`" needs no new argument — the LANDED value-read does it directly.** The seam
was mis-pinned 3–4× (the wall-vs-escape conflation) precisely because the spliced `edge i` is
`vᵢ`-incident, hence *not* an edge of `G − vᵢ`, so the surviving-edge perp leaf
`chainData_freshEdge_perp_of_baseRedundancy` (which lives in the `G − vᵢ` framework) excludes it.
But the target panel is read off the *base seed* `q` directly, not off any framework, and its block
test `hingeRowBlock` depends only on `ends`/`q` — the graph is irrelevant (`hingeRowBlock e =
(span {supportExtensor e})ᗮ`, and `ofNormals`' `supportExtensor` reads only `ends`/`q`). So the two
LANDED bricks that produced the surviving-edge perps work verbatim at the spliced edge `edge i`:

* `interior_group_acolumn_eq_neg_baseRedundancy` (the chain-induction LEAF 4, **framework-free**) —
  the `edge i`-group's screw column at its tail body `vtx i` is the constant `−ρ₀`, carried along
  the chain from the base redundancy `hcomb` and anchored at `vtx 2`. This holds for *every*
  `2 ≤ i < d`, the candidate edge included (it never invokes a framework or the deletion `G − vᵢ`).
* `edgeGroup_acolumn_mem_block` (the column-in-block core) — that same `edge i`-group column lies in
  `(ofNormals Gw ends q).hingeRowBlock (edge i)` for the base framework `Gw` (here `Gw = G − v₁`,
  what the LEAF-3 widening supplies; the graph is immaterial to the block).

Combining, `−ρ₀ ∈ block (edge i)`, so `ρ₀ ∈ block` (negation-closed), so `ρ₀ ⊥ supportExtensor
(edge i) = panelSupportExtensor (q(vtx (i+1),·)) (q(vtx i,·))` (`ofNormals_supportExtensor_eq_panel_
of_ends`, given the `ends`-recording `hends_i`). No per-vertex eq.~(6.52) witness production, no
inductive chain over `s`, no Grassmann–Cayley meet: the eq.~(6.66) carry IS the framework-free value
read, applied one index deeper than the surviving-edge leaf dared.

The carried inputs — the base redundancy `hcomb` (= the LEAF-3 widening's edge-grouped `G_v`-row
form, KT eq.~(6.66)), the per-summand `G`-links `hlink` + base-framework block memberships `hrv`
(the widening's `evGv`/`rvGv` data), the `ends`-recording `hends_i` at the spliced edge, and the
degree-1-at-anchor closure `hdeg1` — are the LEAF-3 base bundle + widening outputs the dispatch
threads in (LEAF-4 step (ii)); they are *not* a deferred crux. -/

Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.2 eq.~(6.66)). The exact `hρe₀` slot the honest interior arm
`chainData_interior_realization_hρGv` consumes at an interior matched candidate `i` (`2 ≤ i`),
produced from the SINGLE crux hypothesis
`hsplice : ρ₀ ⊥ (base-seed `edge i` splice panel)` by the cycle-relabel bridge
`reproduced_panel_eq_splice_panel`. With the crux `baseRedundancy_perp_interior_reproduced_panel`
(above) now LANDED, `hsplice` is no longer a deferred obligation — the whole interior-`hρe₀` leaf is
complete modulo the dispatch threading the crux's carried inputs (LEAF-4 step (ii)). This wrapper is
kept in the carry-as-`h…` form so the dispatch can either supply `hsplice` from the crux directly or
re-derive it inline.

This DISSOLVES the prior Route-A-vs-Route-B fork: BOTH routes reduce to `hsplice`. Route A
(`chainData_freshEdge_perp_of_baseRedundancy`) supplies the *surviving*-edge perps (`2 ≤ s`,
`s+1 < i`) that feed the eq.~(6.66) carry as INPUTS — they are not themselves `hsplice` (the spliced

§I.8.24(4.13)/(4.16); Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.2 eq.~(6.66)). The chain dispatch's (CHAIN-2c-iii)
interior branch `chainData_dispatch_interior` feeds the honest interior arm the `hρe₀` slot
`ρ₀ ⊥ panelSupportExtensor (qρ(a,·)) (qρ(b,·))` at the matched interior candidate `i` (`2 ≤ i < d`),
read at candidate `i`'s relabelled seed `qρ = q ∘ shiftPerm i.castSucc` (KT eq.~(6.56)). This leaf
produces exactly that slot from the **single** input the W6b producer already computes — the
edge-grouped `G_v`-row form of the shared redundancy `hingeRow (vtx 0) (vtx 2) ρ₀ =
∑ⱼ cⱼ • hingeRow (uvⱼ)(vvⱼ)(rvⱼ)` (KT eq.~(6.52)/(6.66), the `hedgeGv` bundle re-anchored to the
spliced edge `e₀ = v₀v₂`'s endpoints `(vtx 0, vtx 2)`) — composing the two landed leaves with no
intermediate `hsplice` threading:

* `baseRedundancy_perp_interior_reproduced_panel` (THE conjecture-crux, framework-free) carries the
  base redundancy across `vᵢ` to the spliced chain edge `edge i`: `ρ₀ ⊥` the base-seed panel
  `panelSupportExtensor (q(vtx (i+1),·)) (q(vtx i,·))`;
* `interior_hρe₀_of_splice_perp` (the cycle-relabel bridge `reproduced_panel_eq_splice_panel`)
  rewrites that base-seed splice panel into the consumer's relabelled `qρ`-panel.

So the dispatch threads the widening bundle ONCE and gets the assembly's `hρe₀` directly. NO `hρGv`,
no new linear algebra — pure composition of the crux with the relabel bridge. -/

* the degree-1-at-anchor closure `hdeg1` — a summand incident to the anchor `vtx 2` must use the
  chain edge `edge 2`: the summand is a `G − vtx 1`-link, hence a `G`-edge at `vtx 2`, so by the
  interior degree-2 closure (`deg_two` at `vtx 2`, valid since `3 ≤ d`) it is `edge 1` or `edge 2` —
  but `edge 1` is incident to `vtx 1` (the `link` field at index 1), so it is *not* a
  `G − vtx 1`-link, leaving `edge 2`.

So the dispatch threads LEAF-3's `hedgeGv` bundle and `hends_i` (the `ends`-recording of the matched
chain edge `edge i`) and reads off the consumer's `hρe₀` directly. NO `hρGv`, no new linear
algebra — pure re-anchoring of the landed crux (`interior_hρe₀_of_widening`) to the bundle shape. -/
