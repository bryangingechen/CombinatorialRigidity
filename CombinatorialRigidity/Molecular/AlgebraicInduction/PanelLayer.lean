# The algebraic induction — the panel layer (`sec:molecular-algebraic-induction`)

Phase 21, the fifth proof stratum of the molecular-conjecture program (Phases 17–26; see
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). This is the base file of the `AlgebraicInduction/`
subdirectory — the **panel layer** on top of the Phase-18 `BodyHingeFramework`.

Katoh–Tanigawa's *panel-hinge* framework is a **hinge-coplanar** body-hinge framework: at each
body all incident hinges lie in a common hyperplane (Katoh–Tanigawa 2011, *A proof of the
molecular conjecture*, Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, p.647). We take the panel-data form
(`DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge = hinge-coplanar body-hinge*): each body `v` is assigned a hyperplane
normal `nᵥ ∈ ℝ^(k+2)`, and the hinge at edge `e = uv` is the codimension-2 intersection of the
two panels. Its supporting `k`-extensor is the Grassmann–Cayley meet `panelSupportExtensor`,
equivalently `complementIso (nᵤ ∧ nᵥ)` (`def:panel-support-extensor`); transversality is exactly
linear independence of the two normals. This file also carries the **per-edge annihilator
family** B0 (`lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`): the rigidity rows are polynomial in the panel
normals, the substrate the genericity device varies.

The `BodyHingeFramework`/`PanelHingeFramework` rank-induction nodes, Theorem 5.5, the genericity
device, and the Case-I realization build on top in the sibling files `Pinning`, `PanelHinge`,
`GenericityDevice`, and `CaseI`. See `ROADMAP.md` §21 / `notes/Phase21.md` and the
`sec:molecular-algebraic-induction` dep-graph of `blueprint/src/chapter/algebraic-induction.tex`.

/-! ## The panel support extensor (`def:panel-support-extensor`, panel-layer leaf)

A **panel** at a body is a hyperplane of `ℝ^(k+1)`, carried by its normal vector
`n ∈ ℝ^(k+2)` (homogenized). The hinge at an edge `e = uv` is the codimension-2 intersection
`panel(u) ∩ panel(v)` of the two panels; its supporting `k`-extensor — the element of the
screw space `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` that the rigidity matrix constrains — is the
Grassmann–Cayley **meet** of the two panels. Concretely it is `complementIso (n_u ∧ n_v)`:
the join `n_u ∧ n_v` is the grade-2 extensor of the two normals (`normalsJoin`, landing in
`⋀^2 ℝ^(k+2)`), and the complement iso `complementIso : ⋀^2 V ≃ ⋀^(k+2−2) V = ⋀^k V`
(Phase 21a, `Molecular/Meet.lean`) carries it into `ScrewSpace k`.

This is the leaf the whole panel layer rests on: it produces the supporting extensor of a
panel hinge directly from the per-vertex normals, with the only general-position condition —
the two panels meeting transversally — being exactly the linear independence of the two
normals (`panelSupportExtensor_ne_zero_iff`). So coplanarity (both hinges at `v` lie in
`panel(v)` by construction) and transversality both live in the extensor algebra, and the
panel framework `PanelHingeFramework` (subsequent commit) carries only the per-vertex normals
with no affine-subspace-intersection plumbing. -/

/-- **The grade-2 join of two panel normals** (`def:panel-support-extensor`): the wedge
`n₁ ∧ n₂` of two normal vectors of `ℝ^(k+2)`, landing in the grade-2 piece
`⋀^2 ℝ^(k+2)`. The join of the two panels' poles, dual to the codimension-2 intersection of
the panels themselves; the `complementIso` of this is the panel hinge's supporting extensor
(`panelSupportExtensor`). -/

/-- **A `⋀²`-coordinate of `normalsJoin` is the `2 × 2` minor of the two normals** (B0, the

basis of `⋀² ℝ^(k+2)` (indexed by the 2-element subsets `s ⊆ Fin (k+2)`), the `s`-coordinate of
the grade-2 join `normalsJoin n₁ n₂` is the `2 × 2` minor
`n₁(i)·n₂(j) − n₁(j)·n₂(i)`, where `i < j` are the two ordered elements of `s`. This is the
exterior-power duality pairing `ιMultiDual` against the standard dual basis
(`exteriorPower.basis_repr_apply` + `ιMultiDual_apply_ιMulti`), whose value is the determinant of
the `2 × 2` matrix of the normals' coordinates at the columns picked out by `s`
(`Matrix.det_fin_two`). It is *bilinear* in the two normals — degree-2 in their entries — which is
the analytic fact the genericity device (`lem:genericity-device`) rests on: the panel-support
extensor `complementIso (normalsJoin n₁ n₂)` is a fixed linear image, so every rigidity-row
coordinate is a degree-2 polynomial in the panel normals, and a rank attained at one realization is
attained generically. -/

/-- **A `⋀²`-coordinate of `normalsJoin` as a degree-2 multivariate polynomial in the panel
coordinates** (B0, the device-keystone polynomiality; `lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`). Regard a
panel realization as a point `q : α × Fin (k+2) → ℝ` of the panel-coordinate space — `q (a, i)` is
the `i`-th coordinate of body `a`'s normal — and fix two bodies `u v : α` and a basis index
`s ⊆ Fin (k+2)`. Then the `s`-coordinate of the grade-2 join `normalsJoin (q (u, ·)) (q (v, ·))`
is the evaluation at `q` of the explicit degree-2 polynomial
`X (u, i)·X (v, j) − X (u, j)·X (v, i)` (`normalsJoinPoly u v s`, with `i < j` the two ordered
elements of `s`). This is the `MvPolynomial`-lift of the bilinear minor `normalsJoin_basis_repr`:
each `⋀²`-coordinate of the join is `MvPolynomial.eval`-of-a-fixed-polynomial, the precise input
shape (the coordinate family `c`, with `hg` the eval identity) the genericity device
`exists_good_realization` consumes once the fixed linear `complementIso` and the per-edge

(`def:panel-support-extensor`, the eq. (6.12) shear identity; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1).
`normalsJoin (n₁ + t • n₂) n₂ = normalsJoin n₁ n₂`. The grade-2 join is the alternating map
`ιMulti ℝ 2 ![·, ·]`, so adding `t • n₂` to the first column splits off (column-linearity,
`AlternatingMap.map_update_add` / `map_update_smul`) the term `t • ιMulti ℝ 2 ![n₂, n₂]`, which
vanishes because the two columns are equal (`map_update_self`). This is the algebraic content of
Katoh–Tanigawa's degenerate eq. (6.12) placement of the re-inserted body `v`: placing `v`'s normal
at `n_a + t • n_b` makes `v`'s `b`-hinge reproduce the `e₀ = ab`-hinge of the inductive

grade, so the result lands in `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` and is consumed verbatim by the
Phase-18 hinge constraint. This is the panel-layer source of supporting extensors, replacing
the body-hinge `affineSubspaceExtensor` of the free-hinge model with a coplanar-by-construction

nonzero exactly when the two panel normals are independent, i.e. the panels meet
transversally in a genuine codimension-2 hinge. This is the general-position hypothesis the
panel realizations of Theorem 5.5 supply (the panel analogue of the body-hinge framework's

the wedge (`AlternatingMap.map_swap`) — so the fixed linear image `complementIso` carries the sign

(6.45), Phase 22g). The `d = 3` form of the duality consumed by the Case-III `hsplit` producer.
Given two independent panel normals `n_u, n'` of a panel `Π(u)` and two points `pi, pj` of the line
`L = pi pj ⊂ Π(u)` (each dot-orthogonal to both normals), a screw functional
`r : Dual(ScrewSpace 2)` that annihilates the candidate `va`-hinge's supporting extensor
`panelSupportExtensor n_u n'` also annihilates the spanning point-join
`p̄ᵢ ∨ p̄ⱼ = extensor ![pi, pj]` — and *contrapositively*, the producer's existential witness
`r̂(p̄ᵢ ∨ p̄ⱼ) ≠ 0` (Claim 6.12, `case_III_claim612`) forces `r̂(panelSupportExtensor n_u n') ≠ 0`,
the nonzero-row input the row-space criterion at `C(L)` feeds to the single-candidate brick.

/-- **Two linearly-independent common-perp points of two independent normals**
(`def:genuine-hinge-realization`, perp-pair sub-brick of the meet-decomposition lemma; Phase 22i
L0a). Given two linearly independent normals `n₁ n₂ : Fin 4 → ℝ` (i.e. the panels `Π₁, Π₂` are
transversal), there exist two linearly independent points `p : Fin 2 → Fin 4 → ℝ` both lying in
*both* panels: `p i ⬝ᵥ n₁ = 0` and `p i ⬝ᵥ n₂ = 0` for `i = 0, 1`. These are the generators of
the `2`-dimensional common-perp space (the intersection line `Π₁ ∩ Π₂` in `ℝ⁴`).

The construction: the pairing map `L x = ![n₁ ⬝ᵥ x, n₂ ⬝ᵥ x] : ℝ⁴ → ℝ²` is the `mulVecLin` of
the `2 × 4` matrix with rows `n₁, n₂`; its kernel `W = ker L` has `finrank W = 4 - rank L ≥ 4 - 2

/-- **Two linearly-independent extensors inside a common panel `n^⊥ ⊆ ℝ⁴`**
(`def:genuine-hinge-realization`, the base producer's coincident-panel geometric brick; Phase 22i
L3a). For a nonzero normal `n : Fin 4 → ℝ`, there are two point-pairs `p, q : Fin 2 → Fin 4 → ℝ`,
each lying in the panel `n^⊥` (`p i ⬝ᵥ n = 0`, `q i ⬝ᵥ n = 0`), whose `ScrewSpace 2` extensors are
linearly independent. This is the two-non-proportional-extensors-in-a-common-hyperplane device of
Katoh–Tanigawa's `|V| = 2` parallel-pair realization (Lemma 5.3, KT 2011 p. 670): two hinges whose
panels coincide (`Π(u) = Π(v) = n^⊥`) but whose supporting extensors are independent give the full
`ScrewSpace 2` rank `D = 6`, which the base producer feeds to `theorem_55_base`.

The construction: pick three LI vectors `a, b, c` spanning `n^⊥` (`exists_three_perp`), set
`p := ![a, b]`, `q := ![a, c]`; the LI of `![a ∧ b, a ∧ c]` follows from the LI of `![a, b, c]`
(`linearIndependent_pair_extensor_of_li3`), and transports through the injective `⋀[ℝ]^2`-inclusion
to `ScrewSpace 2`. (The result holds for any `n`, since `n^⊥` is at least `3`-dimensional even at

/-- **The meet of two transversal panels is the extensor of two common-perp points**
(`def:genuine-hinge-realization`, the M4 engine; Phase 22i L0a). For two linearly independent
(= transversal) normals `n₁ n₂ : Fin 4 → ℝ`, the panel meet `panelSupportExtensor n₁ n₂` is the
extensor of some pair of points `p : Fin 2 → Fin 4 → ℝ` each lying in both panels:

```lean
((panelSupportExtensor (k := 2) n₁ n₂ : ScrewSpace 2) : ExteriorAlgebra ℝ (Fin 4 → ℝ)) = extensor p
∧ ∀ i, p i ⬝ᵥ n₁ = 0 ∧ p i ⬝ᵥ n₂ = 0
```

This is the pointwise `ExtensorInPanel` decomposition of the panel meet — the forgetful map M4
(`hasPanelRealization_of_generic`) consumes it to build the `ExtensorInPanel` witnesses for the
honest bare motive M2 `HasPanelRealization`, via the meet-decomposition applied at the `ends e`
panel pair.

Proof route:
1. Perp-pair sub-brick `exists_two_perp_of_linearIndependent_normals`: extract two LI common-perp
   points `p₀, p₁` of `{n₁, n₂}` (finrank `ker ≥ 2`).
2. Double-annihilator: every `r : Dual(ScrewSpace 2)` killing `panelSupportExtensor n₁ n₂` also
   kills `extensor ![p₀, p₁]` (by `panelSupportExtensor_join_eq_zero_of_eq_zero`), so
   `⟨extensor ![p₀, p₁], _⟩ ∈ span {panelSupportExtensor n₁ n₂}` (by
   `Subspace.forall_mem_dualAnnihilator_apply_eq_zero_iff`).
3. Proportionality: `Submodule.mem_span_singleton` gives a scalar `c` and nonzero-ness
   (`extensor_ne_zero_iff_linearIndependent` + LI of `p₀, p₁` + `panelSupportExtensor_ne_zero_iff`)
   forces `c ≠ 0`.
4. Rescale `p = ![c⁻¹ • p₀, p₁]`: the scalar absorbed by the first slot gives
   `extensor ![c⁻¹ • p₀, p₁] = c⁻¹ • extensor ![p₀, p₁] = panelSupportExtensor n₁ n₂`. -/

2011 §6.4.1 eq. (6.12)/(6.45), Phase 22g). The `d = 3` Case-III producer builds its degenerate
candidate by placing the re-inserted body `v` at the sheared normal `n_u + t • n'` (`t ≠ 0`) of the
witness panel `Π(u)`, with the `va`-hinge's second panel `a` at `n_u`; the candidate's `va`-hinge
supporting extensor is then `panelSupportExtensor (n_u + t • n') n_u`, a nonzero multiple of the
panel-meet `C(L) = complementIso (n_u ∧ n')` of the witness line `L = pi pj ⊂ Π(u)`
(`panelSupportExtensor_add_smul_left`, the eq. (6.12) `va`-line). So a screw functional `r` not
annihilating the spanning point-join `p̄ᵢ ∨ p̄ⱼ = extensor ![pi, pj]` — Claim 6.12's existential
witness (`case_III_claim612`) — does not annihilate that `va`-hinge support either:
`r̂(p̄ᵢ ∨ p̄ⱼ) ≠ 0 ⟹ r̂(panelSupportExtensor (n_u + t • n') n_u) ≠ 0`.

This is the nonzero-row input the row-space criterion (`linearIndependent_sumElim_candidateRow_iff`)

the shear-invariant, producer-direction reading of the point-join ↔ panel-meet annihilation transfer
`panelSupportExtensor_join_eq_zero_of_eq_zero` (the unsheared `n_u, n'` form): the shear factor `-t`

the re-inserted body `v`'s normal along the witness line `L = n_a ∧ n'` to `n_a + t • n'` (`t ≠ 0`);
for the new block `e_b = vb` to stay a genuine hinge the producer needs `n_a + t • n'` independent
from the IH `b`-normal `n_b`. This holds for **all but at most one** value of `t`: if two distinct
`t₁ ≠ t₂` were both bad (each making `n_a + tᵢ • n'` collinear with `n_b`), subtracting the two

exactly when the family of grade-2 joins `i ↦ normalsJoin (n₁ i) (n₂ i)` is independent in

(Claim 6.4/6.9): the existence of an infinitesimally rigid panel-cycle realization
(`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4) needs `m ≤ D` panel hinges whose supporting extensors are
independent, and this lemma turns that screw-space-independence question into an independence
question on the grade-2 joins of the panel normals — a concrete exterior-power statement that a

(`lem:cycle-realization`, the genericity-device existence half; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Claim 6.4/6.9):
for any `m ≤ D = screwDim k` there are `m` pairs of panel normals whose grade-2 joins
`i ↦ normalsJoin (n₁ i) (n₂ i)` are linearly independent in `⋀² ℝ^(k+2)`. This is the
exterior-algebraic core of the generic-panel independence argument: rather than a real-polynomial
perturbation, the witness is a *basis choice* — pick `m` distinct 2-element subsets of `Fin (k+2)`
(possible since the index set `Set.powersetCard (Fin (k+2)) 2` has cardinality
`(k+2).choose 2 = D ≥ m`) and take the corresponding pairs of standard basis vectors. Each join is
then a member of the basis-indexed exterior-power family
(`normalsJoin_basisFun_orderEmbOfFin`), and that whole family is linearly independent
(`exteriorPower.ιMulti_family_linearIndependent_ofBasis`, the `⋀²`-basis fact bottoming on the
extensor-independence Lemma 2.1, Phase 17), so the chosen subfamily inherits independence via the
injection of indices. Combined with `panelSupportExtensor_linearIndependent_iff` this supplies the

/-- **Cyclic-seed existence for the triangle base (`d = 3`)** (`lem:triangle-normals`, §1.48(1)):
there exist three vectors `n₀ n₁ n₂ : Fin (k+2) → ℝ` (with `k ≥ 1`, so `k+2 ≥ 3`) such that
(1) each cyclic pair has a nonzero grade-2 join (`normalsJoin nᵢ nⱼ ≠ 0`) and (2) the cyclic
supporting-extensor family `i ↦ panelSupportExtensor (![n₀,n₁,n₂] i) (![n₁,n₂,n₀] i)` is
linearly independent. The witness is the standard basis: `n₀ = e₀`, `n₁ = e₁`, `n₂ = e₂` in
`ℝ^(k+2)`. The cyclic family reduces (via `normalsJoin_swap` at the reversed pair) to the sorted
family `nJ(e₀,e₁), nJ(e₁,e₂), nJ(e₀,e₂)` up to unit scalars; the sorted family equals a
3-member subfamily of the `⋀²`-basis indexed by distinct 2-subsets; the basis family is LI and
unit scaling preserves LI. Each join `nJ(eᵢ,eⱼ)` for `i < j` is nonzero since it is a nonzero
member of the LI basis family. -/

/-- **A `⋀^k`-coordinate of the panel support extensor as a degree-2 polynomial in the panel
coordinates** (B0, the device-keystone polynomiality; `lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`,
sub-commit 2). The supporting `k`-extensor
`panelSupportExtensor n_u n_v = complementIso (n_u ∧ n_v)` is a *fixed linear image* of the
grade-2 join `normalsJoin n_u n_v`, so each of its coordinates in the standard exterior-power
basis of `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` (indexed by `k`-element subsets `t ⊆ Fin (k+2)`) is a fixed
linear combination of the `⋀²`-coordinates of the join — and those are the degree-2 minors
`normalsJoinPoly` of sub-commit 1. Concretely, regarding a panel realization as a point
`q : α × Fin (k+2) → ℝ` of the panel-coordinate space and fixing two bodies `u v : α`,
`panelSupportPoly u v t` is the explicit `MvPolynomial`
`∑ s, (complementIso-matrix coefficient)·normalsJoinPoly u v s`. The complement-iso coefficient
at `(t, s)` is the fixed real `⋀^k`-coordinate `repr (complementIso (b₂ s)) t` of the image of the
`s`-th grade-2 basis vector; carried as `MvPolynomial.C` constants, the sum stays degree-2
(`panelSupportPoly_totalDegree_le`). The next B0 sub-commit assembles the per-edge annihilator
family `{Cᵢeⱼ* − Cⱼeᵢ*}` (linear in `C`) on top, giving the device's coordinate family `c`. -/

/-- **The panel-support-extensor coordinate polynomial evaluates to the actual `⋀^k`-coordinate**
(B0, `lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`, sub-commit 2): the eval identity carrying

`q : α × Fin (k+2) → ℝ` gives the `t`-th coordinate (in the standard `⋀^k`-basis) of the panel
support extensor `panelSupportExtensor (q (u, ·)) (q (v, ·))`. The proof expands
`panelSupportExtensor = complementIso ∘ normalsJoin`, writes the grade-2 join in the `⋀²`-basis
(`Basis.sum_repr`), and pushes the fixed linear `complementIso` and the basis `repr` through the
sum (as the `ℝ`-valued composite `Finsupp.lapply t ∘ₗ repr ∘ₗ complementIso`, via `map_sum`),
reducing the per-`s` coordinate to `eval q (normalsJoinPoly u v s)` (`normalsJoinPoly_eval`). This
is the eval half of the `complementIso`-staging of B0: the panel rows' `ScrewSpace`-coordinates
are `eval`-of-a-fixed-degree-2-polynomial. -/

/-! ## The per-edge annihilator family (B0, `lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`, sub-commit 3)

The hinge-row block at an edge is the dual annihilator `(span {C})^⊥` of the supporting extensor
`C = panelSupportExtensor n_u n_v ∈ ScrewSpace k` (`def:hinge-row-block`). To feed it into the
genericity device the rows must be presented as a *spanning family* of functionals whose
coordinates are polynomials in the panel normals. The standard spanning family of `(span {C})^⊥`
is `{C_{t₁} e_{t₂}^{*} − C_{t₂} e_{t₁}^{*}}` over pairs of basis indices `(t₁, t₂)`, where `C_t` is
the `t`-th coordinate of `C` in the standard `⋀^k` basis and `e_t^{*}` the dual basis functional:
each member annihilates `C` (its value at `C` is `C_{t₁} C_{t₂} − C_{t₂} C_{t₁} = 0`), and together
they span the whole `(D−1)`-dimensional annihilator. Crucially each member is *linear in `C`*, so
substituting the degree-2 panel-coordinate polynomials `panelSupportPoly` for `C`'s coordinates
keeps the rigidity rows degree-2 in the panel normals — the device's polynomiality input. -/

/-- The **standard exterior-power basis of the screw space** `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)`
(`def:rigidity-matrix`): the exterior power of the standard basis `Pi.basisFun ℝ (Fin (k+2))` of
`ℝ^(k+2)`, indexed by the `k`-element subsets `t ⊆ Fin (k+2)` (`Set.powersetCard (Fin (k+2)) k`).
Its coordinate functionals `screwBasis.repr (·) t` are the `⋀^k`-coordinates the panel-support
polynomial `panelSupportPoly` evaluates to (`panelSupportPoly_eval`); abbreviated here so the

`t`-th coordinate of `C` (`screwBasis k |>.repr C t`) and `e_t^{*} = screwBasis k |>.coord t` the
dual basis functional. It annihilates `C` (`annihRow_apply_self`) and the whole family spans the

/-- **The annihilator family spans the hinge-row block** (B0, `lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`,
the device-input span identity): for a nonzero screw vector `C`, the span of the per-pair
annihilator functionals `annihRow C t₁ t₂` is the dual annihilator `(span {C})^⊥` — exactly the
hinge-row block `r(p(e))` of an edge with supporting extensor `C` (`def:hinge-row-block`).

The containment `⊆` is `annihRow_apply_self` (each member annihilates `C`). For `⊇`, fix a
coordinate `t₀` with `C_{t₀} ≠ 0` (it exists since `C ≠ 0`). Any `f` annihilating `C` is the
explicit combination `f = ∑_t (f(b t) / C_{t₀}) • annihRow C t₀ t`: checking it on each basis
vector `b_s`, the `s ≠ t₀` coordinate is `f(b_s)` directly, and the `s = t₀` coordinate collapses
to `f(b_{t₀})` precisely because `∑_t C_t f(b_t) = f C = 0`. So `f`
lies in the span of the family. This is the spanning brick that turns the
panel-coordinatized `annihRow` family into a finite family whose span is the rigidity-row space —
the device's `hcoord` input through `infinitesimalMotions_eq_dualCoannihilator`. -/

The genericity device's rank polynomial `Q` (a `det` of a submatrix of `c = ± annihRowPoly`,
`exists_polynomial_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_at`) must be certified to have *rational*
coefficients, so that the footnote-6 descent
`MvPolynomial.eval_ne_zero_of_coeffs_subset_range_of_algebraicIndependent` turns its
non-vanishing into non-vanishing at an inductive seed algebraically independent over `ℚ`. The
coefficients bottom on the `panelSupportPoly` constants `repr (complementIso (e_S)) t`, which are
rational by `complementIso_exteriorPower_repr_mem_range_algebraMap`; the `normalsJoinPoly` minors
have `±1` (integer) coefficients. Propagating these up the `normalsJoinPoly → panelSupportPoly →
annihRowPoly` chain is cleanest as membership in the **subring** `(map (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)).range`
(the polynomials with rational coefficients), which `mem_range_map_iff_coeffs_subset` identifies
with `coeffs ⊆ range (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)`. The device-level `c`/`Q` propagation (the `det` step) lives
with the device. -/

/-! ## Partition-respecting motions — the `hub` foundation (`lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound`,
`def:D-deficiency`)

The genericity-free codimension lower bound `D + def(G̃) ≤ dim Z(G,p)` of Katoh–Tanigawa
Proposition 1.1 (`rigidityMatrix_prop11`'s `hub`; Jackson–Jordán 2009 Thm 6.1) is built from a
deficiency-attaining partition `P` of `V(G)`. The construction's foundation is the subspace of
infinitesimal motions that are **constant on each part of `P`** — the *partition-respecting
motions* `partitionMotions f` of a labeling `f : α → α` (whose fibers are the parts). A
part-constant screw assignment automatically satisfies the hinge constraint at every
*non-crossing* edge (both endpoints in the same part, so `S u − S v = 0`), so the only genuine
constraints come from the `d_G(P) = |crossingEdges G f|` crossing edges, each cutting down `D − 1`
of the `D` screw coordinates. The full count `finrank (partitionMotions f) ≥ D·|P| − (D−1)·d_G(P)
= D + partitionDef(f)` (a later brick) then gives `hub` by maximizing over `P`.

This file lands the foundation: the subspace, its membership characterization, its containment in
`Z(G,p)`, the trivial-motion containment, and the `def`-free consequence `D ≤ dim Z(G,p)`. The
dimension lower bound `D + partitionDef(f) ≤ finrank (partitionMotions f)` and the maximization
into `hub` are the subsequent bricks. -/

/-! ### The per-crossing-edge cut — the `hub` dimension lower bound

The full `hub` dimension lower bound `D·|P| − (D−1)·d_G(P) ≤ finrank (partitionMotions f)` is
proved by **rank-nullity over `W_f`**. The cut is the linear map `partitionCutMap` sending a
part-constant screw assignment `S ∈ W_f` to the family of relative screw centers
`(S u_e − S v_e) mod span C(e)` over the *crossing* edges `e ∈ crossingEdges G f` (each summand a
quotient of `ScrewSpace k` by the hinge's `1`-dimensional supporting span). Its kernel inside
`W_f` is exactly `partitionMotions f`: a part-constant `S` automatically satisfies the hinge
constraint at every non-crossing edge (both endpoints in one part, so `S u − S v = 0`), so the
only genuine constraints are at the `d_G(P) = |crossingEdges|` crossing edges. The codimension of
this kernel is `≤ ∑_{crossing e} finrank (ScrewSpace ⧸ span C(e)) = (D−1)·d_G(P)` (each genuine
hinge `C(e) ≠ 0` cuts down exactly `D−1`), so `finrank (partitionMotions f) ≥ finrank W_f −
(D−1)·d_G(P) ≥ D·|P| − (D−1)·d_G(P)`. -/

/-- The endpoint-and-distinct-labels witness carried by membership in `crossingEdges G f`

crossing hinge is genuine. Carried as a *single* `Submodule.pi` quotient (rather than a pi of

/-! ### Complement-separated `|range f|`-form hub bound and B2 (`Phase 22i L0c`)

The landed `screwDim_mul_numParts_sub_le_finrank_partitionMotions` bound uses `numParts G f =
|f '' V(G)|`, which counts only labels of `V(G)`-vertices. For B2 we need the ambient complement
count `|V(G)ᶜ|` to appear. The route (design doc §1.57(b)):

1. Re-state the bound with `Nat.card (Set.range f)` replacing `numParts G f` — lossless because
   `finrank_partitionConstant` is already exact (`D · |range f|`).
2. Normalize the def-attaining `f₀` to `g` with `g '' V(G) ⊆ V(G)` by injecting the
   `numParts` label values into `V(G)` (possible since `|f₀ '' V(G)| ≤ |V(G)|`). The injection
   preserves `numParts` (ncard of image unchanged) and `crossingEdges` (injective → distinct iff
   distinct). Since `g x = x` for `x ∉ V(G)`, `range g = g '' V(G) ∪ V(G)ᶜ` disjointly, so
   `|range g| = numParts + |V(G)ᶜ|`.
3. Apply the range bound at `g` and chain to `infinitesimalMotions`. -/

/-- **The `|range f|`-form motion bound** (Phase 22i L0c): the `≥ D·|P|` step in
`screwDim_mul_numParts_sub_le_finrank_partitionMotions` is lossless — `finrank_partitionConstant`
gives `D·|range f|` exactly — so the same rank-nullity argument gives the exact-range version
`D·|range f| − (D−1)·d_G(P) ≤ finrank (partitionMotions f)` with no extra cost. This is the
foundational building block for the relative hub and B2: plugging the complement-separated
refinement `f'` gives the ambient range count `|range f'| = numParts + |Vᶜ|`. -/
