# The algebraic induction — the panel layer (`sec:molecular-algebraic-induction`)

Phase 21, the fifth proof stratum of the molecular-conjecture program (Phases 17–26; see
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). This is the base file of the `AlgebraicInduction/`
subdirectory — the **panel layer** on top of the Phase-18 `BodyHingeFramework`.

Katoh–Tanigawa's *panel-hinge* framework is a **hinge-coplanar** body-hinge framework: at each
body all incident hinges lie in a common hyperplane (Katoh–Tanigawa 2011, *A proof of the
molecular conjecture*, Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, p.647). We take the panel-data form
(`DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge = hinge-coplanar body-hinge*): each body `v` is assigned a hyperplane
normal `nᵥ ∈ ℝ^(k+2)`, and the hinge at edge `e = uv` is the codimension-2 intersection of the
two panels. Its supporting `k`-extensor is the Grassmann–Cayley meet `panelSupportExtensor`,
equivalently `complementIso (nᵤ ∧ nᵥ)` (`def:panel-support-extensor`); transversality is exactly
linear independence of the two normals. This file also carries the **per-edge annihilator
family** B0 (`lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`): the rigidity rows are polynomial in the panel
normals, the substrate the genericity device varies.

The `BodyHingeFramework`/`PanelHingeFramework` rank-induction nodes, Theorem 5.5, the genericity
device, and the Case-I realization build on top in the sibling files `Pinning`, `PanelHinge`,
`GenericityDevice`, and `CaseI`. See `ROADMAP.md` §21 / `notes/Phase21.md` and the
`sec:molecular-algebraic-induction` dep-graph of `blueprint/src/chapter/algebraic-induction.tex`.

/-! ## The panel support extensor (`def:panel-support-extensor`, panel-layer leaf)

A **panel** at a body is a hyperplane of `ℝ^(k+1)`, carried by its normal vector
`n ∈ ℝ^(k+2)` (homogenized). The hinge at an edge `e = uv` is the codimension-2 intersection
`panel(u) ∩ panel(v)` of the two panels; its supporting `k`-extensor — the element of the
screw space `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` that the rigidity matrix constrains — is the
Grassmann–Cayley **meet** of the two panels. Concretely it is `complementIso (n_u ∧ n_v)`:
the join `n_u ∧ n_v` is the grade-2 extensor of the two normals (`normalsJoin`, landing in
`⋀^2 ℝ^(k+2)`), and the complement iso `complementIso : ⋀^2 V ≃ ⋀^(k+2−2) V = ⋀^k V`
(Phase 21a, `Molecular/Meet.lean`) carries it into `ScrewSpace k`.

This is the leaf the whole panel layer rests on: it produces the supporting extensor of a
panel hinge directly from the per-vertex normals, with the only general-position condition —
the two panels meeting transversally — being exactly the linear independence of the two
normals (`panelSupportExtensor_ne_zero_iff`). So coplanarity (both hinges at `v` lie in
`panel(v)` by construction) and transversality both live in the extensor algebra, and the
panel framework `PanelHingeFramework` (subsequent commit) carries only the per-vertex normals
with no affine-subspace-intersection plumbing. -/

/-- **The grade-2 join of two panel normals** (`def:panel-support-extensor`): the wedge
`n₁ ∧ n₂` of two normal vectors of `ℝ^(k+2)`, landing in the grade-2 piece
`⋀^2 ℝ^(k+2)`. The join of the two panels' poles, dual to the codimension-2 intersection of
the panels themselves; the `complementIso` of this is the panel hinge's supporting extensor
(`panelSupportExtensor`). -/

basis of `⋀² ℝ^(k+2)` (indexed by the 2-element subsets `s ⊆ Fin (k+2)`), the `s`-coordinate of
the grade-2 join `normalsJoin n₁ n₂` is the `2 × 2` minor
`n₁(i)·n₂(j) − n₁(j)·n₂(i)`, where `i < j` are the two ordered elements of `s`. This is the
exterior-power duality pairing `ιMultiDual` against the standard dual basis
(`exteriorPower.basis_repr_apply` + `ιMultiDual_apply_ιMulti`), whose value is the determinant of
the `2 × 2` matrix of the normals' coordinates at the columns picked out by `s`
(`Matrix.det_fin_two`). It is *bilinear* in the two normals — degree-2 in their entries — which is
the analytic fact the genericity device (`lem:genericity-device`) rests on: the panel-support
extensor `complementIso (normalsJoin n₁ n₂)` is a fixed linear image, so every rigidity-row
coordinate is a degree-2 polynomial in the panel normals, and a rank attained at one realization is
attained generically. -/

/-- **A `⋀²`-coordinate of `normalsJoin` as a degree-2 multivariate polynomial in the panel
coordinates** (B0, the device-keystone polynomiality; `lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`). Regard a
panel realization as a point `q : α × Fin (k+2) → ℝ` of the panel-coordinate space — `q (a, i)` is
the `i`-th coordinate of body `a`'s normal — and fix two bodies `u v : α` and a basis index
`s ⊆ Fin (k+2)`. Then the `s`-coordinate of the grade-2 join `normalsJoin (q (u, ·)) (q (v, ·))`
is the evaluation at `q` of the explicit degree-2 polynomial
`X (u, i)·X (v, j) − X (u, j)·X (v, i)` (`normalsJoinPoly u v s`, with `i < j` the two ordered
elements of `s`). This is the `MvPolynomial`-lift of the bilinear minor `normalsJoin_basis_repr`:
each `⋀²`-coordinate of the join is `MvPolynomial.eval`-of-a-fixed-polynomial, the precise input

(`def:panel-support-extensor`, the eq. (6.12) shear identity; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.1).
`normalsJoin (n₁ + t • n₂) n₂ = normalsJoin n₁ n₂`. The grade-2 join is the alternating map
`ιMulti ℝ 2 ![·, ·]`, so adding `t • n₂` to the first column splits off (column-linearity,
`AlternatingMap.map_update_add` / `map_update_smul`) the term `t • ιMulti ℝ 2 ![n₂, n₂]`, which
vanishes because the two columns are equal (`map_update_self`). This is the algebraic content of
Katoh–Tanigawa's degenerate eq. (6.12) placement of the re-inserted body `v`: placing `v`'s normal
at `n_a + t • n_b` makes `v`'s `b`-hinge reproduce the `e₀ = ab`-hinge of the inductive

codimension-2 intersection `panel(u) ∩ panel(v)`, given as the Grassmann–Cayley meet of the
two panels — the complement iso `complementIso : ⋀^2 V ≃ ⋀^(k+2−2) V` (Phase 21a) of their
grade-2 join `normalsJoin n₁ n₂`. The target grade `k + 2 − 2 = k` is exactly the screw-space
grade, so the result lands in `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` and is consumed verbatim by the
Phase-18 hinge constraint. This is the panel-layer source of supporting extensors, replacing
the body-hinge `affineSubspaceExtensor` of the free-hinge model with a coplanar-by-construction
panel hinge. -/

(`def:panel-support-extensor`): `panelSupportExtensor n₁ n₂ ≠ 0 ↔ LinearIndependent ℝ ![n₁, n₂]`.
The complement iso is a linear equivalence (`complementIso`, Phase 21a), so it sends a nonzero
join to a nonzero extensor; combined with `normalsJoin_ne_zero_iff` the supporting extensor is
nonzero exactly when the two panel normals are independent, i.e. the panels meet
transversally in a genuine codimension-2 hinge. This is the general-position hypothesis the
panel realizations of Theorem 5.5 supply (the panel analogue of the body-hinge framework's
`affineSubspaceExtensor_ne_zero_iff`). -/

The support extensor is `complementIso (normalsJoin n₁ n₂)` with `normalsJoin n₁ n₂ =
exteriorPower.ιMulti ℝ 2 ![n₁, n₂]` *alternating* — swapping the two columns of `![n₁, n₂]` negates
the wedge (`AlternatingMap.map_swap`) — so the fixed linear image `complementIso` carries the sign
through. The hinge constraint is membership in `span {supportExtensor e}`, unchanged by this sign,
which is why an edge's two endpoints may be recorded in either order without affecting the motion
space (`PanelHingeFramework.infinitesimalMotions_ofNormals_eq_of_ends_swap`). -/

`panelSupportExtensor (n₁ + t • n₂) n₂ = panelSupportExtensor n₁ n₂`. The supporting extensor is
the fixed linear image `complementIso` of the grade-2 join, so the shear identity
`normalsJoin_add_smul_right` carries through. This is the row reproduction the degenerate placement
of the re-inserted body `v` supplies: at `v`'s normal `n_a + t • n_b`, the `vb`-hinge support
extensor equals the `ab`-hinge support extensor of the inductive realization, so the new `vb`-row
reproduces the old `e₀ = ab`-row in the block-triangular placement (KT eq. (6.12)/(6.16)). -/

*first* column gives `normalsJoin (n₁ + t • n₂) n₁ = -t • normalsJoin n₁ n₂` (first-column
linearity + the self-join vanishing `normalsJoin_self` + the antisymmetric swap `normalsJoin_swap`);
the linear `complementIso` carries it through. With `panelSupportExtensor n₁ n₂ ≠ 0` (transversal
`e₀`-hinge) and `t ≠ 0`, the `va`-hinge is a genuine line `L ⊂ Π(a)`, keeping KT's eq. (6.12)

/-- **Existence of an independent grade-2-join family for a cycle of `m ≤ D` panels**
(`lem:cycle-realization`, the genericity-device existence half; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Claim 6.4/6.9):
for any `m ≤ D = screwDim k` there are `m` pairs of panel normals whose grade-2 joins
`i ↦ normalsJoin (n₁ i) (n₂ i)` are linearly independent in `⋀² ℝ^(k+2)`. This is the
exterior-algebraic core of the generic-panel independence argument: rather than a real-polynomial
perturbation, the witness is a *basis choice* — pick `m` distinct 2-element subsets of `Fin (k+2)`
(possible since the index set `Set.powersetCard (Fin (k+2)) 2` has cardinality
`(k+2).choose 2 = D ≥ m`) and take the corresponding pairs of standard basis vectors. Each join is
then a member of the basis-indexed exterior-power family
(`normalsJoin_basisFun_orderEmbOfFin`), and that whole family is linearly independent
(`exteriorPower.ιMulti_family_linearIndependent_ofBasis`, the `⋀²`-basis fact bottoming on the

/-- **A `⋀^k`-coordinate of the panel support extensor as a degree-2 polynomial in the panel

sub-commit 2). The supporting `k`-extensor
`panelSupportExtensor n_u n_v = complementIso (n_u ∧ n_v)` is a *fixed linear image* of the
grade-2 join `normalsJoin n_u n_v`, so each of its coordinates in the standard exterior-power
basis of `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` (indexed by `k`-element subsets `t ⊆ Fin (k+2)`) is a fixed
linear combination of the `⋀²`-coordinates of the join — and those are the degree-2 minors
`normalsJoinPoly` of sub-commit 1. Concretely, regarding a panel realization as a point
`q : α × Fin (k+2) → ℝ` of the panel-coordinate space and fixing two bodies `u v : α`,
`panelSupportPoly u v t` is the explicit `MvPolynomial`
`∑ s, (complementIso-matrix coefficient)·normalsJoinPoly u v s`. The complement-iso coefficient
at `(t, s)` is the fixed real `⋀^k`-coordinate `repr (complementIso (b₂ s)) t` of the image of the
`s`-th grade-2 basis vector; carried as `MvPolynomial.C` constants, the sum stays degree-2
(`panelSupportPoly_totalDegree_le`). The next B0 sub-commit assembles the per-edge annihilator

`panelSupportExtensor = complementIso ∘ normalsJoin`, writes the grade-2 join in the `⋀²`-basis

/-! ## The per-edge annihilator family (B0, `lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`, sub-commit 3)

The hinge-row block at an edge is the dual annihilator `(span {C})^⊥` of the supporting extensor
`C = panelSupportExtensor n_u n_v ∈ ScrewSpace k` (`def:hinge-row-block`). To feed it into the
genericity device the rows must be presented as a *spanning family* of functionals whose
coordinates are polynomials in the panel normals. The standard spanning family of `(span {C})^⊥`
is `{C_{t₁} e_{t₂}^{*} − C_{t₂} e_{t₁}^{*}}` over pairs of basis indices `(t₁, t₂)`, where `C_t` is
the `t`-th coordinate of `C` in the standard `⋀^k` basis and `e_t^{*}` the dual basis functional:
each member annihilates `C` (its value at `C` is `C_{t₁} C_{t₂} − C_{t₂} C_{t₁} = 0`), and together
they span the whole `(D−1)`-dimensional annihilator. Crucially each member is *linear in `C`*, so
substituting the degree-2 panel-coordinate polynomials `panelSupportPoly` for `C`'s coordinates
keeps the rigidity rows degree-2 in the panel normals — the device's polynomiality input. -/

/-- The **standard exterior-power basis of the screw space** `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)`
(`def:rigidity-matrix`): the exterior power of the standard basis `Pi.basisFun ℝ (Fin (k+2))` of
`ℝ^(k+2)`, indexed by the `k`-element subsets `t ⊆ Fin (k+2)` (`Set.powersetCard (Fin (k+2)) k`).
Its coordinate functionals `screwBasis.repr (·) t` are the `⋀^k`-coordinates the panel-support
polynomial `panelSupportPoly` evaluates to (`panelSupportPoly_eval`); abbreviated here so the

`t`-th coordinate of `C` (`screwBasis k |>.repr C t`) and `e_t^{*} = screwBasis k |>.coord t` the
dual basis functional. It annihilates `C` (`annihRow_apply_self`) and the whole family spans the

/-- **The annihilator family spans the hinge-row block** (B0, `lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`,
the device-input span identity): for a nonzero screw vector `C`, the span of the per-pair
annihilator functionals `annihRow C t₁ t₂` is the dual annihilator `(span {C})^⊥` — exactly the
hinge-row block `r(p(e))` of an edge with supporting extensor `C` (`def:hinge-row-block`).

The containment `⊆` is `annihRow_apply_self` (each member annihilates `C`). For `⊇`, fix a
coordinate `t₀` with `C_{t₀} ≠ 0` (it exists since `C ≠ 0`). Any `f` annihilating `C` is the
explicit combination `f = ∑_t (f(b t) / C_{t₀}) • annihRow C t₀ t`: checking it on each basis
vector `b_s`, the `s ≠ t₀` coordinate is `f(b_s)` directly, and the `s = t₀` coordinate collapses
to `f(b_{t₀})` precisely because `∑_t C_t f(b_t) = f C = 0`. So `f`
lies in the span of the family. This is the spanning brick that turns the
panel-coordinatized `annihRow` family into a finite family whose span is the rigidity-row space —
the device's `hcoord` input through `infinitesimalMotions_eq_dualCoannihilator`. -/

/-! ## Rationality of the panel-coordinate polynomials (B0 rationality bridge, Phase 22d)

The genericity device's rank polynomial `Q` (a `det` of a submatrix of `c = ± annihRowPoly`,
`exists_polynomial_ne_zero_of_linearIndependent_at`) must be certified to have *rational*
coefficients, so that the footnote-6 descent
`MvPolynomial.eval_ne_zero_of_coeffs_subset_range_of_algebraicIndependent` turns its
non-vanishing into non-vanishing at an inductive seed algebraically independent over `ℚ`. The
coefficients bottom on the `panelSupportPoly` constants `repr (complementIso (e_S)) t`, which are
rational by `complementIso_exteriorPower_repr_mem_range_algebraMap`; the `normalsJoinPoly` minors
have `±1` (integer) coefficients. Propagating these up the `normalsJoinPoly → panelSupportPoly →
annihRowPoly` chain is cleanest as membership in the **subring** `(map (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)).range`
(the polynomials with rational coefficients), which `mem_range_map_iff_coeffs_subset` identifies
with `coeffs ⊆ range (algebraMap ℚ ℝ)`. The device-level `c`/`Q` propagation (the `det` step) lives
with the device. -/

/-- The degree-2 minor `normalsJoinPoly` has rational (in fact `±1`) coefficients: it is a

/-! ## Partition-respecting motions — the `hub` foundation (`lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound`,
`def:D-deficiency`)

The genericity-free codimension lower bound `D + def(G̃) ≤ dim Z(G,p)` of Katoh–Tanigawa
Proposition 1.1 (`rigidityMatrix_prop11`'s `hub`; Jackson–Jordán 2009 Thm 6.1) is built from a
deficiency-attaining partition `P` of `V(G)`. The construction's foundation is the subspace of
infinitesimal motions that are **constant on each part of `P`** — the *partition-respecting
motions* `partitionMotions f` of a labeling `f : α → α` (whose fibers are the parts). A
part-constant screw assignment automatically satisfies the hinge constraint at every
*non-crossing* edge (both endpoints in the same part, so `S u − S v = 0`), so the only genuine
constraints come from the `d_G(P) = |crossingEdges G f|` crossing edges, each cutting down `D − 1`
of the `D` screw coordinates. The full count `finrank (partitionMotions f) ≥ D·|P| − (D−1)·d_G(P)
= D + partitionDef(f)` (a later brick) then gives `hub` by maximizing over `P`.

This file lands the foundation: the subspace, its membership characterization, its containment in
`Z(G,p)`, the trivial-motion containment, and the `def`-free consequence `D ≤ dim Z(G,p)`. The
dimension lower bound `D + partitionDef(f) ≤ finrank (partitionMotions f)` and the maximization
into `hub` are the subsequent bricks. -/

`V(G)` encoded by a labeling `f : α → α` when `S u = S v` whenever `u, v` carry the same label,
`f u = f v` (`def:D-deficiency`). Such an assignment is determined by one screw center per part. -/

`partitionMotions f = infinitesimalMotions ⊓ {S | IsPartitionConstant f S}`. This is the

/-- Every trivial motion respects every partition (`lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound`,
`def:D-deficiency`): a constant screw assignment `S u = S v` for *all* `u, v` is in particular
constant on each part, and is a motion (`isInfinitesimalMotion_of_isTrivialMotion`), so
`trivialMotions ≤ partitionMotions f`. The `D` trivial motions are the part-independent floor of
the partition motions — the `+D` in the `hub` bound `D + def(G̃) ≤ dim Z`. -/

codimension lower bound `hub` of Katoh–Tanigawa Proposition 1.1; the full bound `D + def(G̃) ≤
dim Z` adds the `def(G̃)` extra motions a deficiency-attaining partition supplies (subsequent
