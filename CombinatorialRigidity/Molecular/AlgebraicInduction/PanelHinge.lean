# The algebraic induction — panel-hinge framework and Theorem 5.5

Phase 21 (molecular-conjecture program; see `notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). On top of the
body-hinge rank infrastructure (`AlgebraicInduction/Pinning`), this file lands the panel layer's
top nodes:

* the panel framework `PanelHingeFramework` (`def:panel-hinge-framework`), its body-hinge
  interpretation `toBodyHinge`, the moment-curve / `ofParam` / `ofNormals` constructors, and the
  general-position predicate `IsGeneralPosition`;
* the `withNormal` operation and the Case-II rank infrastructure (setting the panel normal at one
  body);
* the hinge-coplanarity spec `IsHingeCoplanar`;
* **Theorem 5.5** (`thm:theorem-55`) — realization at the target rank — with the realization
  motives `HasFullRankRealization` / `HasGenericFullRankRealization`;
* the analytic half of **Proposition 1.1** (`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`): generic
  `rank = D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`.

The genericity device (`lem:genericity-device`) and the Case-I realization composer build on top in
`GenericityDevice` and `CaseI`. See `ROADMAP.md` §21 / `notes/Phase21.md` and the
`sec:molecular-algebraic-induction` dep-graph.

/-! ## The panel-hinge framework (`def:panel-hinge-framework`)

Katoh–Tanigawa's *panel-hinge* framework is a **hinge-coplanar** body-hinge framework: at each
body `v`, all incident hinges lie in a common hyperplane `panel(v)` (KT 2011 p.647). We carry
the panel-data form (`DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge = hinge-coplanar body-hinge*): a
`PanelHingeFramework` assigns each body `v` a hyperplane *normal* `normal v ∈ ℝ^(k+2)`, and the
hinge at an edge `e = uv` is the codimension-2 intersection `panel(u) ∩ panel(v)`, whose
supporting `k`-extensor is the Grassmann–Cayley meet `panelSupportExtensor (normal u) (normal v)`
(`def:panel-support-extensor`). Because each edge's two endpoints are not a function of the edge
alone in mathlib's relational `Graph`, the structure also carries an explicit endpoint selector
`ends : β → α × α`; the supporting extensor of `e` is the meet of the two normals at `ends e`.

The body-hinge interpretation `toBodyHinge` (`def:panel-hinge-framework`) feeds this support
extensor into the Phase-18 rigidity-matrix rank theory verbatim: it is the `BodyHingeFramework`
with `supportExtensor e = panelSupportExtensor (normal u) (normal v)` at `(u,v) = ends e`. Every
incident hinge at `v` is then a meet whose join factor includes `normal v`, so it lies in the
panel `panel(v) = {normal v}^⊥` by construction — coplanarity is structural, with no
affine-intersection plumbing. The coplanarity *spec* `IsHingeCoplanar` on a bare
`BodyHingeFramework` is exactly "arises as a `toBodyHinge`", automatic for the panel
constructions of Theorem 5.5 (`isHingeCoplanar_toBodyHinge`). -/

/-- A **`d = k+1`-dimensional panel-hinge framework** (`def:panel-hinge-framework`;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011): a multigraph `G : Graph α β` together with a per-body *panel normal*
`normal v ∈ ℝ^(k+2)` (the pole of body `v`'s hyperplane `panel(v)`) and an endpoint selector
`ends : β → α × α` for the edges. The hinge at edge `e` is the codimension-2 intersection of the
two panels at `ends e`; its supporting `k`-extensor is the meet `panelSupportExtensor` of the two
normals (`def:panel-support-extensor`). Unlike `BodyHingeFramework`'s free hinges, every hinge
incident to `v` lies in the single panel `panel(v)` — the hinge-coplanarity that *defines* the
panel-hinge (molecular) model. -/

/-- The **body-hinge interpretation** of a panel-hinge framework (`def:panel-hinge-framework`):

panel support extensor `panelSupportExtensor (normal u) (normal v)` of the two panel normals at
`(u, v) = ends e` (`def:panel-support-extensor`). This feeds the panel hinge directly into the
Phase-18 rigidity-matrix rank theory — null space, hinge-row blocks, pin-a-body and parallel
lemmas all apply verbatim — while keeping the framework coplanar by construction
(`isHingeCoplanar_toBodyHinge`). It is the panel analogue of the affine constructor
`BodyHingeFramework.ofHinge`. -/

the panel normals of `P` are in *general position* when any two normals at distinct bodies are
linearly independent — equivalently every pair of panels meets transversally. This is the
single general-position condition the panel realizations of Theorem 5.5 supply: under it, every
hinge whose two endpoints are distinct bodies has a nonzero supporting extensor
(`supportExtensor_ne_zero_of_isGeneralPosition`), the transversality hypothesis `he` the
block-triangular gluing (`hglue_of_forest`) and the per-edge independent-rows brick
(`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_edge`) require of each forest hinge. It is the panel
analogue of the affine-independence general-position condition on a `BodyHingeFramework`'s
hinge points, and the realization-side counterpart of the abstract extensor-independence
existence (`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`). -/

(`P.IsGeneralPosition`) and edge `e` joins two distinct bodies (`(P.ends e).1 ≠ (P.ends e).2`),
then `P.toBodyHinge.supportExtensor e ≠ 0`. Immediate from
`toBodyHinge_supportExtensor_ne_zero_iff` and the general-position pairwise independence. This is
the realization-side source of the transversality hypothesis `he` each forest hinge carries into
the block-triangular gluing `hglue_of_forest`: once the normals are in general position, every
hinge of the rigid block is genuine and contributes its `D − 1` independent rigidity rows. -/

normal `momentCurve t : Fin (k + 2) → ℝ`. Two such points at *distinct* parameters are linearly
independent (`momentCurve_pair_linearIndependent`), so assigning bodies distinct parameters yields
panel normals in general position for *any* number of bodies — the explicit witness that supplies
the genericity-free general-position data of the Case-I rigid block, where standard-basis vectors
cover only `|α| ≤ k + 2`. -/

two coordinates `(1, s)`, `(1, t)` has determinant `t − s ≠ 0`: evaluating a vanishing combination
`c₁ • momentCurve s + c₂ • momentCurve t = 0` at coordinates `0` and `1` (the latter available
since `k + 2 ≥ 2`) gives `c₁ + c₂ = 0` and `c₁ s + c₂ t = 0`, whence `c₁ (s − t) = 0` forces
`c₁ = 0` and then `c₂ = 0`. This is the pairwise independence the moment-curve normal assignment
needs for `IsGeneralPosition`. -/

the panel framework `P.withMomentNormals param` re-uses `P`'s multigraph and endpoint selector but
sets every body's panel normal to the moment-curve point `momentCurve (param a)`. Its normals are
in general position (`isGeneralPosition_withMomentNormals`) for *any* number of bodies — the
explicit construction the Case-I rigid block needs to source `hglue_of_forest`'s transversality
hypothesis `he` (standard-basis normals cover only `|α| ≤ k + 2`). The endpoint selector and graph
are untouched, so the framework is glued onto the inductive realization exactly as `withGraph` /
`withNormal` are. -/

Distinct bodies get distinct parameters (injectivity), and distinct-parameter moment-curve points
are independent (`momentCurve_pair_linearIndependent`). This is the explicit, dimension-free
general-position witness for the Case-I rigid block: combined with
`supportExtensor_ne_zero_of_isGeneralPosition` it discharges every forest hinge's transversality
hypothesis `he` in `hglue_of_forest`, isolating the genericity (a single injective real assignment)
from the geometric gluing. -/

(which re-decorate an existing framework), `ofParam` needs no prior framework — it is the
realization-side entry point for the genuinely-geometric Case-I assembly, where the parent graph
`G` and its hinge-endpoint data are the combinatorial inputs and the genericity is a single
injective real assignment `param`. When `param` is injective the normals are automatically in
general position (`isGeneralPosition_ofParam`), so every hinge joining two distinct bodies is
transversal — the realization-side source of `hglue_of_forest`'s `he`. -/

legs; Phase 22). The bounded analytic brick the Case-I shared-seed coupling was missing: a single
nonzero `MvPolynomial (α × Fin (k+2)) ℝ` whose non-roots are exactly the *general-position* normal
assignments. Concretely the product over distinct body pairs of the leading `2 × 2` minor
polynomial `pairLeadingMinorPoly` — at a free normal assignment `q` the product is nonzero iff
*every* pair's leading minor is nonzero (`Finset.prod_ne_zero_iff`), and a nonzero leading minor
forces the pair's two panel normals to be independent
(`pair_linearIndependent_of_leading_minor_ne_zero`), i.e. general position of `ofNormals G ends q`.

The polynomial is genuinely nonzero (witnessed): at *any* injective `param : α → ℝ` the moment-curve
assignment `q (a, i) = (param a)^i` makes each factor evaluate to the Vandermonde determinant
`param b − param a ≠ 0`, so the product is nonzero there (`hgp_seed`) — the explicit non-root the
design names. Multiplying this factor into the two per-leg rank polynomials of
`exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn` and applying `MvPolynomial.exists_eval_ne_zero` to the triple
product yields one shared seed at which both legs are rigid *and* the normals are in general
position — the seed `hasFullRankRealization_of_splice_ofNormals` consumes. The seed obligation of
`lem:case-I-splice-placement` thereby reduces to the per-leg rank polynomials alone (gap (G1),
dissolved by the two-motive split); this brick closes gap (G2). -/

the two endpoints** of an edge `e` — `q₀ (ends e).1 = q (ends e).1` and `q₀ (ends e).2 = q (ends

    = (ofNormals Gv ends q).toBodyHinge.panelRow ends (e, t₁, t₂)`,

regardless of the two underlying graphs `G`, `Gv`. This is KT's seam identity
`R(G, p_1; E \setminus \{vb\}, V \setminus \{v\}) = R(G_v^{ab}, q)` in per-row form: the panel row
`hingeRow (ends e).1 (ends e).2 (annihRow (C(p(e))) t₁ t₂)` reads only the endpoint selector `ends`,
the index `(t₁, t₂)`, and the supporting extensor `C(p(e)) = panelSupportExtensor (normal (ends

underlying graph never enters a `panelRow` (it carries `ends` and the normals, not `graph`).

This is the only research-shaped piece of the candidate-completion (`lem:case-III-candidate-row`)
that needs a fresh statement. At the eq.~(6.12) placement `p_1 = q₀` (`q₀ = q` off the re-inserted

`panelSupportExtensor_add_smul_right` to match the `ab`-extensor on top of this seam. Transporting
the green redundant-`ab`-row combination (`exists_redundant_panelRow_ab_of_finrank_eq`, KT
eq.~(6.23)) across the seam, the resulting row of `R(G, p_1)` vanishes off `v`'s column, which the

/-! ## Cycle realizations (`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4 — panel content)

Katoh–Tanigawa's Lemma 5.4 (the geometric content of Crapo–Whiteley 1982 Prop 3.4 / Whiteley
1999 Kluwer Prop 3): a cycle graph `G = (V, E)` with `3 ≤ |V| ≤ D` has an infinitesimally rigid,
nonparallel *panel*-hinge realization `(G, p)` — equivalently a realization at the full rank
`D(|V|−1)`, the target rank of the minimal `0`-dof case (`RankHypothesis 0`). Geometrically a
cycle of `m` panels and `m` hinges is rigid exactly when its `m` supporting `k`-extensors are
linearly independent in the `D`-dimensional screw space `ScrewSpace k`, which a generic choice of
the `m` panel normals achieves whenever `m ≤ D` (the dimension bound `3 ≤ |V| ≤ D`).

This file lands the **short-cycle base** of that statement: the panel analogue of the two-body
base case `theorem_55_base`, lifted through `toBodyHinge`. A `PanelHingeFramework` on a two-body
cover whose two edges' panel support extensors are independent has an infinitesimally rigid
body-hinge interpretation, i.e. realizes `RankHypothesis 0` at the full rank `D`. The general
cycle (`|V| ≥ 3`) and the generic-panel independence argument that supplies the linearly
independent supporting extensors (bottoming on the extensor-independence Lemma 2.1, Phase 17)
remain red — that is the genericity device (Claim 6.4/6.9) shared with Cases I/II. -/

`{u, v} = V(G)` (`def:rank-hypothesis`, `IsInfinitesimallyRigidOn`), at the full rank
`D = D(2−1) − 0`. This is the brick the general panel-cycle realization (KT Lemma 5.4, `|V| ≥ 3`)
is built from; the linearly independent panel extensors are supplied generically (Claim 6.4/6.9,
deferred). Immediate from `BodyHingeFramework.theorem_55_base` applied to `P.toBodyHinge`. The

dimension of `ScrewSpace k` forces `m ≤ D`. The general-position bound the general cycle

/-! ## Setting the panel normal at one body (`def:panel-hinge-framework`, Case II infra)

Case II of Theorem 5.5 re-inserts a reducible degree-2 body `v` into the splitting-off
`G_v^{ab}`: it builds a panel realization of the larger graph `G` from one of `G_v^{ab}` by
*choosing a panel normal for `v`* (the two new hinges at `v` are the meets of `panel(v)` with
the panels of its two neighbours `a, b`). The framework-side carrier of that move is
`withNormal v n`: override the panel normal at the single body `v` by `n`, leaving the
multigraph, the endpoint selector, and every other body's normal fixed. This is the per-body
analogue of `withGraph` (which swaps the whole graph) and the panel-data primitive the
1-extension is assembled from; combined with `withGraph` (to enlarge the graph by `v`'s two new
edges) it produces the extended panel realization whose rank Case II accounts for via the `+D`
rank-lift `rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions`. -/

Lemma 6.8): the panel-hinge $1$-extension realizes the target rank at `k'` exactly when the
splitting-off carries pinned-motion dimension `k'`. Building the extended panel framework on `G`
by choosing a panel normal `n` for the re-inserted body `v` (`withNormal v n`), the extended
framework realizes the rank hypothesis at `k'` (`RankHypothesis k'`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D + k'`)
exactly when the *original* framework's body-`v`-pinned motions have dimension `k'` —
`(P.withNormal v n).toBodyHinge.RankHypothesis k' ↔ finrank (P.toBodyHinge.pinnedMotions v) = k'` —
provided `v` is yet unhinged in `P.graph` (no linking edge has `v` among its endpoints, `hv`). The

Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.3 Lemmas 6.7/6.8; GREEN-modulo the Phase-21b genericity device). Let `P`
be a panel-hinge framework on the splitting-off graph `G_v^{ab} = P.graph`, in which the
re-inserted body `v` is *yet unhinged* (no linking edge has `v` among its endpoints, `hv`), and
let `G` be the parent graph with `P.graph ≤ G`. Choosing a panel normal `n` for `v` and enlarging
the graph to `G` produces the extended panel framework `(P.withNormal v n).withGraph G` — the
panel-hinge analogue of Whiteley's bar-joint `1`-extension. Then the extended framework realizes
the target rank at `k'` (`RankHypothesis k'`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D + k'`) **iff** the original
splitting-off framework `P` carries body-`v`-pinned-motion dimension `k'` — so the inductive
realization of `G_v^{ab}` lifts to `G`, the two new hinge-row blocks accounting for the `+D`
(`rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions`, the pin-a-body Lemma 5.1).

This is the genericity-free assembly of Case II: it wires the vertex-level splitting-off
op `G_v^{ab}` (green in Phase 20) into the panel `withNormal`/`withGraph` carriers through the
rank-lift accounting (`rankHypothesis_withNormal_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions` via the unhinged-`v`
invariance `toBodyHinge_withNormal_pinnedMotions_eq`) and the genericity-gated tightness
(`toBodyHinge_pinnedMotions_withGraph_eq`, the `≥` half). The two graph-side hypotheses are
genericity-free: `hv` (`v` unhinged in `G_v^{ab}`, true before its two new edges are added) and
`hinc` (every link of `G` lost on passing to `G_v^{ab}` is `v`-incident — the
`isLink_incident_of_not_removeVertex` brick at the common lower bound, here `G_v^{ab}` itself). The
**one** input from the Phase-21b device is `hspan`: each base-`v`-pinned motion lands in the two
new edges' panel-support spans (`S a ∈ span C(e_a)`, `S b ∈ span C(e_b)`). That is *false
pointwise* — it holds only for the general-position normals the genericity rank/dimension count
(Claim 6.9) selects, supplied by `exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`. Taking `hspan` as an
explicit hypothesis makes `lem:case-II` GREEN-modulo-21b. The `S w ∈ span C(e)` form (rather than
the full hinge constraint `S v − S w ∈ span C(e)`) is the collapse a base-pinned `S v = 0` already
forces (`toBodyHinge_hnew_of_isLink_incident`). -/

/-! ## Theorem 5.5: realization at the target rank (`thm:theorem-55`)

The capstone of Phase 21. Where the combinatorial induction (Phase 20,
`Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction`, KT Theorem 4.9) reduced every minimal `0`-dof-graph to the
two-vertex double edge, this theorem *realizes* that reduction at the rigidity-matrix rank:
every minimal `0`-dof-graph `G` with `|V| ≥ 2` carries a panel-hinge realization of the full
rank `D(|V|−1)`, i.e. an infinitesimally rigid panel-hinge framework `(G,p)` (Katoh–Tanigawa
2011 §5, Theorem 5.5, at `k = 0`).

The proof is the genericity-free assembly over the Phase-20 reduction dichotomy: it runs the
well-founded induction principle `Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction` against the *realization*
motive `HasFullRankRealization` (`∃ Q, Q.graph = G ∧ Q.toBodyHinge.IsInfinitesimallyRigidOn V(G)`,
the `V(G)`-relative rank form `rank R(G,p) = D(|V(G)|−1)`; the absolute null-space form is
unsatisfiable for the non-spanning inductive subgraphs — Phase-21b re-plan, `def:rank-hypothesis`),
discharging its three premises with the base case (`lem:theorem-55-base`), the splitting-off
1-extension (Case II, `lem:case-II`), and the rigid-subgraph contraction (Case I, `lem:case-I`).
The two inductive cases are GREEN-modulo-21b — each lands the iff-realization `RankHypothesis ↔
pinned dimension` taking its genericity input (the general-position panel normals of Claim
6.9/6.4) as an explicit hypothesis — so the induction *itself* is genericity-free and inherits
the Phase-21b citation transitively through the cases. The per-case realization steps are taken
here as hypotheses (`hbase`/`hsplit`/`hcontract`), the shape the consumer assembles from the
panel capstones `toBodyHinge_rankHypothesis_zero_cycle` (base), the Case II
`rankHypothesis_withNormal_withGraph_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions`, and the Case I
`toBodyHinge_rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotionsOn` once the genericity device supplies the
general-position normals; Case III (`k = 0`, no proper rigid subgraph) closes the dichotomy and
is deferred to Phases 22–23. -/

/-- **A graph has a *general-position* full-rank panel realization** (`thm:theorem-55`, the
general-position realization motive; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §5–§6, the "nonparallel" strengthening).
The strengthening of `HasFullRankRealization` that additionally pins the realizing framework `Q` in
general position (`Q.IsGeneralPosition`, pairwise-independent panel normals): there is a panel-hinge
framework `Q` on `G` with `Q.IsGeneralPosition` whose body-hinge interpretation is infinitesimally
rigid on `V(G)`. KT's Theorem 5.5 concludes exactly this whenever `G` is **simple** ("there exists a
nonparallel realization", printed p. 669); general position can genuinely fail in the non-simple
base / Lemma-6.2 cases (two parallel edges want *equal* panels, p. 670), so the bare
`HasFullRankRealization` is the right motive there and this is a *separate* parallel motive carried
only through the simple Case-I cases (KT Lemma 6.3/6.5).

**Two-motive split (Phase 22).** Rather than condition a single motive on `G.Simple` — which would
force threading simplicity through the Phase-20 reduction `Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction`, and
`splitOff` does *not* preserve simplicity (KT Lemma 6.7, so an `(G.Simple → …)` conjunct's inductive
hypothesis lands on the wrong graph at the splitting-off step) — the general-position obligation is
localized to this second motive, carried only through the simple cases, with a one-line forgetful
map (derived via B1,
`isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_vertexSet_iff_finrank_span_rigidityRows`) to the bare motive.
`theorem_55_minimalKDof_k_all_k`'s bare-motive statement is untouched. This dissolves gap (G1) (the
splice/rank-polynomial producers `hasFullRankRealization_of_splice_ofNormals` /
`exists_rankPolynomial_of_rigidOn` need a
*general-position* rigid seed, which a bare rigid IH does not supply) at the source: a
general-position parent seed is general-position for every leg (`withGraph` keeps the same normals),
so the producers' `hgp`/`hne` hypotheses are discharged for free.

**Link-recording conjunct (Phase 22b route (i)).** The motive additionally records that the
realizing framework's endpoint selector `Q.ends` pins, for each link of `G`, the *same* unordered
pair the link does (`∀ e u v, G.IsLink e u v → (Q.ends e = (u, v)) ∨ swap`). This is the invariant
the Case-I composer's `ends`-swap transport (`hasGenericRealization_transport_ends`'s `hswap`) and
contraction-leg alignment consume to move the IH realization's rigidity onto the parent / relabel
selector: rigidity alone does not force a *free* `ends` to agree with another selector, but two
link-recording selectors pin the same pair on every link and so agree up to swap. Every producer
builds `ofNormals G ends q₀` with a link-recording `ends` and supplies the conjunct for free
(`ofNormals_recordsLinks_of_hends`); the composer manufactures the canonical link-recording
`G.endsOf`. The bare motive `HasFullRankRealization` and `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k_all_k` are
untouched — the strengthening is generic-motive only (only the Case-I generic flow transports
across `ends`).

**No algebraic-independence conjunct (Phase 30 RELAX; deleted 2026-07-10).** Phases 22d–29 carried
a fifth conjunct here — `AlgebraicIndependent ℚ (fun (a, i) ↦ Q.normal a i)`, KT's standing
inductive choice (Katoh–Tanigawa 2011, footnote 6, p. 685) that the inductive realization's seed
lie off the zero locus of every nonzero rational polynomial. The Phase 30 RELAX refactor
(user-sanctioned; `notes/Phase30.md`) replaced every spine consumption of that conjunct with the
**product route**: each composition that re-uses an IH realization fixes finitely many base
det/rank polynomials at the IH's q-free selector *before* the seed and takes one
`MvPolynomial.exists_eval_ne_zero` shot on their product, so only the *specific* polynomials the
argument tests need a non-root — no seed needs to avoid *all* rational polynomials at once, and the
conjunct was deleted. The nested-subgraph rank certification the conjunct used to feed (KT's
eq.-(6.22) uses) now flows through the polynomial-form producers
(`exists_nested_rankPolynomial_lower_all_k`, `exists_rankPolynomial_of_IH_linking`). The bare
motive and `theorem_55_minimalKDof_k_all_k` remain untouched throughout. -/

Placed in the root `Molecular` namespace (not inside `PanelHingeFramework`): the def
quantifies a free `BodyHingeFramework` + a normal assignment, so `PanelHingeFramework`
dot-notation would misdirect. Both `k` and `n` are explicit parameters; call sites pin
`G.deficiency n` via their `G.IsMinimalKDof n _` hypothesis. -/

/-! ## Proposition 1.1, analytic half: generic rank `= D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`
(`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`)

The last red node of Phase 21. Katoh–Tanigawa's Proposition 1.1 reconciles the *honest*
panel-hinge rigidity-matrix rank `R(G,p)` of `Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean` (Phase 18) with the
combinatorial deficiency `def(G̃)` of `Molecular/Deficiency.lean` (Phase 19): for a generic
panel-hinge realization `(G,p)`,
`rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)` (Jackson–Jordán 2009 Thm 6.1, geometric side).

The **matroidal half** — `def(G̃) = corank M(G̃)`, equivalently `|B| + def(G̃) = D(|V|−1)` for
any base `B` of `M(G̃)` — landed green in Phase 19 (`Graph.rank_add_deficiency_eq`,
`Graph.isBase_ncard_add_deficiency_eq`). This file lands the **analytic half**, the bridge from
the rank `R(G,p)` to the deficiency, in the basis-free codimension convention of Phase 18: `rank
R(G,p) = D|V| − dim Z(G,p)` (`finrank_screwAssignment`), so the target equality `rank R(G,p) =
D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)` is precisely `dim Z(G,p) = D + def(G̃)`, i.e. `F.RankHypothesis (def(G̃))`
(`def:rank-hypothesis`, at `k' = def`).

It is **GREEN-modulo the Phase-21b genericity device**, assembled from the two inequalities that
pin the equality, in the established idiom of Cases I/II (`hglue`, `hspan`):

* *Genericity-free upper bound* `hub` (`rank R(G,p) ≤ D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`, equivalently `D +
  def(G̃) ≤ dim Z(G,p)`): the codimension form `lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound` together with the
  deficiency count. A vertex partition `P` attaining `def(G̃)` contracts each part to one effective
  body, leaving `D(|P|−1) − (D−1)·d_G(P) = partitionDef` independent screw freedoms in the null
  space beyond the `D` trivial motions; maximizing over `P` gives `def(G̃)` extra motions. This is
  genuine genericity-free content (no max-rank assumption — *every* realization has at least this
  many motions); it is now **discharged** in-proof by
  `screwDim_add_deficiency_le_finrank_infinitesimalMotions` (the `hub` lower bound, green from the
  Phase-19 partition machinery), so the only inputs are the dimension fixing `n = k + 1` and the
  genuine-hinge condition `C(e) ≠ 0` the partition cut needs.
* *From Phase 21b (cited)* `hgen` (`rank R(G,p) ≥ D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`, equivalently `dim Z(G,p) ≤ D
  + def(G̃)`): the generic max-rank lower bound — Theorem 5.5 (`theorem_55_minimalKDof_gen`) pushed
  from minimal `k`-dof-graphs to all multigraphs by deleting down to a minimal `k`-dof spanning
  subgraph and observing that re-adding edges only grows the rank (`lem:motions-mono-of-graph-le`).
  The generic-rank argument (Claim 6.4) selects the point attaining this max; that is the Phase-21b
  device. -/
