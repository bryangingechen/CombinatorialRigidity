# The algebraic induction: Theorem 5.5 base, Cases I & II (`sec:molecular-algebraic-induction`)

Phase 21, the fifth proof stratum of the molecular-conjecture program (Phases 17–26; see
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). Where the combinatorial induction (Phase 20,
`Molecular/Induction.lean`) reduced every minimal `0`-dof-graph to the two-vertex double
edge (Theorem 4.9, `Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction`), this file *realizes* that reduction at
the rigidity-matrix rank: Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 (*A proof of the molecular conjecture*,
Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, §5, §6.1–6.3) **Theorem 5.5** — every minimal `k`-dof-graph
`G` with `|V| ≥ 2` has a panel-hinge realization `(G,p)` with `rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − k` —
its base case, Case I (proper rigid subgraph), and Case II (`k > 0` splitting). The crux
Case III (`k = 0`, no proper rigid subgraph) is deferred to Phases 22–23.

## The panel layer (`def:panel-hinge-framework`)

Katoh–Tanigawa's *panel-hinge* framework is a **hinge-coplanar** body-hinge framework: at
each vertex all incident hinges lie in a common hyperplane (KT 2011 p.647). The conjecture's
content is that this coplanarity constraint can be met *without losing rigidity*. The
Phase-18 `BodyHingeFramework` carries free hinges with no coplanarity, so the
realization-existence nodes need a **panel layer** on top (`DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge =
hinge-coplanar body-hinge*). We take the panel-data form: a panel realization assigns each
body `v` a *hyperplane normal* `nᵥ ∈ ℝ^(k+2)`, and the hinge at an edge `e = uv` is the
codimension-2 intersection `panel(u) ∩ panel(v)` of the two panels. Its supporting
`k`-extensor — the screw-space element `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` the rigidity matrix
constrains — is the Grassmann–Cayley meet of the two panels, equivalently
`complementIso (nᵤ ∧ nᵥ)` (`panelSupportExtensor`): the join `nᵤ ∧ nᵥ` is the grade-2
extensor of the two normals (`normalsJoin`, in `⋀^2 ℝ^(k+2)`), and the complement iso
`complementIso : ⋀^2 V ≃ ⋀^(k+2−2) V = ⋀^k V` (Phase 21a, `Molecular/Meet.lean`) lands it in
`ScrewSpace k`. The only general-position condition — the two panels meet transversally — is
then exactly that the two normals are linearly independent
(`panelSupportExtensor_ne_zero_iff`), so coplanarity and transversality both live in the
extensor algebra and no affine-subspace-intersection plumbing is needed. This is the leaf the
panel layer rests on; the panel framework `PanelHingeFramework`, its body-hinge interpretation
`toBodyHinge`, and the coplanarity spec `IsHingeCoplanar` land on top in subsequent commits.

## The rank-induction nodes

This file lands the `sec:molecular-algebraic-induction` dep-graph in dependency order. The
regime-agnostic rank leaf nodes (retained verbatim under the panel layer):

* `RankHypothesis` (`def:rank-hypothesis`) — the realization hypothesis (6.1). Carried in
  the basis-free form of Phase 18 (`Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean`): the panel-hinge rigidity
  matrix `R(G,p)` is the constraint family cutting out the null space
  `Z(G,p) = F.infinitesimalMotions`, and `rank R(G,p) = D|V| − dim Z(G,p)`
  (`def:rigidity-matrix`'s codimension form, `finrank_screwAssignment`). The target rank
  `rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − k = D|V| − (D + k)` is therefore the null-space dimension
  `dim Z(G,p) = D + k`, the form carried here. (`D = screwDim k`.)
* `theorem_55_base` (`lem:theorem-55-base`) — the `|V| = 2`, `k = 0` base case: the
  two-vertex double edge with two non-parallel hinges (independent supporting extensors)
  realizes the full rank `D = D(2−1) − 0`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D`. The framework is
  infinitesimally rigid (`Z(G,p) = trivialMotions`), so its null space is the `D`-dimensional
  trivial-motion space — exactly the parallel-hinges-full Lemma 5.3
  (`eq_of_hingeConstraint_two_parallel`, Phase 18 green) specialized to the two bodies.

## The rank in basis-free form

Phase 18 carries `rank R(G,p)` as a codimension: the column space is the screw-assignment
space `α → ScrewSpace k` of dimension `D|V|` (`finrank_screwAssignment`), and the null space
is `Z(G,p) = F.infinitesimalMotions`, so `rank R(G,p) = D|V| − dim Z(G,p)`. Rather than carry
the `ℤ`-valued rank and re-derive the column count at each node, the realization hypothesis is
stated directly on the null-space dimension: `RankHypothesis F k` asserts
`dim Z(G,p) = D + k`, the rearrangement of `rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − k`. The two forms are
interchanged by `finrank_screwAssignment`; the null-space form is the one the rank lemmas of
Phase 18 (`finrank_pinnedMotions_add_screwDim`, `finrank_trivialMotions`) already speak.

/-! ## The panel support extensor (`def:panel-support-extensor`, panel-layer leaf)

A **panel** at a body is a hyperplane of `ℝ^(k+1)`, carried by its normal vector
`n ∈ ℝ^(k+2)` (homogenized). The hinge at an edge `e = uv` is the codimension-2 intersection
`panel(u) ∩ panel(v)` of the two panels; its supporting `k`-extensor — the element of the
screw space `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` that the rigidity matrix constrains — is the
Grassmann–Cayley **meet** of the two panels. Concretely it is `complementIso (n_u ∧ n_v)`:
the join `n_u ∧ n_v` is the grade-2 extensor of the two normals (`normalsJoin`, landing in
`⋀^2 ℝ^(k+2)`), and the complement iso `complementIso : ⋀^2 V ≃ ⋀^(k+2−2) V = ⋀^k V`
(Phase 21a, `Molecular/Meet.lean`) carries it into `ScrewSpace k`.

This is the leaf the whole panel layer rests on: it produces the supporting extensor of a
panel hinge directly from the per-vertex normals, with the only general-position condition —
the two panels meeting transversally — being exactly the linear independence of the two
normals (`panelSupportExtensor_ne_zero_iff`). So coplanarity (both hinges at `v` lie in
`panel(v)` by construction) and transversality both live in the extensor algebra, and the
panel framework `PanelHingeFramework` (subsequent commit) carries only the per-vertex normals
with no affine-subspace-intersection plumbing. -/

/-- **The grade-2 join of two panel normals** (`def:panel-support-extensor`): the wedge
`n₁ ∧ n₂` of two normal vectors of `ℝ^(k+2)`, landing in the grade-2 piece
`⋀^2 ℝ^(k+2)`. The join of the two panels' poles, dual to the codimension-2 intersection of
the panels themselves; the `complementIso` of this is the panel hinge's supporting extensor
(`panelSupportExtensor`). -/

(`extensor_ne_zero_iff_linearIndependent`, Phase 17); this is the algebraic form of the two
panels meeting transversally (their normals not collinear), the only general-position
condition the panel layer needs. -/

(`def:panel-support-extensor`): the supporting `k`-extensor `C(p(e)) ∈ ScrewSpace k` of the
codimension-2 intersection `panel(u) ∩ panel(v)`, given as the Grassmann–Cayley meet of the
two panels — the complement iso `complementIso : ⋀^2 V ≃ ⋀^(k+2−2) V` (Phase 21a) of their
grade-2 join `normalsJoin n₁ n₂`. The target grade `k + 2 − 2 = k` is exactly the screw-space
grade, so the result lands in `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` and is consumed verbatim by the
Phase-18 hinge constraint. This is the panel-layer source of supporting extensors, replacing
the body-hinge `affineSubspaceExtensor` of the free-hinge model with a coplanar-by-construction
panel hinge. -/

The complement iso is a linear equivalence (`complementIso`, Phase 21a), so it sends a nonzero
join to a nonzero extensor; combined with `normalsJoin_ne_zero_iff` the supporting extensor is
nonzero exactly when the two panel normals are independent, i.e. the panels meet
transversally in a genuine codimension-2 hinge. This is the general-position hypothesis the
panel realizations of Theorem 5.5 supply (the panel analogue of the body-hinge framework's
`affineSubspaceExtensor_ne_zero_iff`). -/

/-- **Panel support extensor independence reduces to grade-2 join independence**
(`lem:cycle-realization`, the genericity-device reduction): a family of `m` panel support extensors
`i ↦ panelSupportExtensor (n₁ i) (n₂ i)` is linearly independent in the screw space `ScrewSpace k`
exactly when the family of grade-2 joins `i ↦ normalsJoin (n₁ i) (n₂ i)` is independent in
`⋀² ℝ^(k+2)`. Because the complement iso `complementIso : ⋀² V ≃ ⋀^k V` (Phase 21a) is a *linear
equivalence*, it carries independent families to independent families and reflects them.
This is the reduction at the heart of Katoh–Tanigawa's generic-panel independence argument
(Claim 6.4/6.9): the existence of an infinitesimally rigid panel-cycle realization
(`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4) needs `m ≤ D` panel hinges whose supporting extensors are
independent, and this lemma turns that screw-space-independence question into an independence
question on the grade-2 joins of the panel normals — a concrete exterior-power statement that a
basis choice on `⋀²` (the panel-normal analogue of a generic point, bottoming on the
extensor-independence Lemma 2.1) discharges, with `m ≤ D = dim ⋀² ℝ^(k+2)` the dimension cap
(`card_le_screwDim_of_supportExtensor_linearIndependent`). -/

/-- **Existence of an independent grade-2-join family for a cycle of `m ≤ D` panels**
(`lem:cycle-realization`, the genericity-device existence half; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Claim 6.4/6.9):
for any `m ≤ D = screwDim k` there are `m` pairs of panel normals whose grade-2 joins
`i ↦ normalsJoin (n₁ i) (n₂ i)` are linearly independent in `⋀² ℝ^(k+2)`. This is the
exterior-algebraic core of the generic-panel independence argument: rather than a real-polynomial
perturbation, the witness is a *basis choice* — pick `m` distinct 2-element subsets of `Fin (k+2)`
(possible since the index set `Set.powersetCard (Fin (k+2)) 2` has cardinality
`(k+2).choose 2 = D ≥ m`) and take the corresponding pairs of standard basis vectors. Each join is
then a member of the basis-indexed exterior-power family
(`normalsJoin_basisFun_orderEmbOfFin`), and that whole family is linearly independent
(`exteriorPower.ιMulti_family_linearIndependent_ofBasis`, the `⋀²`-basis fact bottoming on the
extensor-independence Lemma 2.1, Phase 17), so the chosen subfamily inherits independence via the
injection of indices. Combined with `panelSupportExtensor_linearIndependent_iff` this supplies the
independent supporting extensors KT Lemma 5.4 needs for a rigid panel-cycle realization, the
existence half of `lem:cycle-realization` that the dimension bound
`card_le_screwDim_of_supportExtensor_linearIndependent` caps from above. -/

/-! ## The `m`-body cycle base (`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4)

The general (`m`-body) panel-cycle realization. A cycle of `m` bodies `0, 1, …, m−1` (carried as
`Fin m`) and `m` hinges, the `i`-th joining body `i` to body `i + 1` (cyclically, `Graph.IsLink
(e i) i (i + 1)`), is infinitesimally rigid exactly when its `m` supporting extensors are
linearly independent. The argument propagates `S u = S v` around the cycle: each hinge constraint
puts the relative screw `S i − S (i + 1)` in the one-dimensional span of `C(p(e i))`, and these
`m` differences telescope around the cycle to `∑ᵢ (S i − S (i+1)) = 0` (the rotation `i ↦ i + 1`
is a bijection of `Fin m`). Independence of the `m` extensors then forces every difference to
vanish (`eq_zero_of_mem_span_singleton_of_sum_eq_zero`, the `m`-edge generalization of the
parallel-hinges-full Lemma 5.3), so `S` is constant on the connected cycle — a trivial motion.
This is the `m`-body generalization of the two-body base case `theorem_55_base`; together with the
dimension bound `card_le_screwDim_of_linearIndependent` (`3 ≤ m ≤ D`) it is the cycle realization
of KT Lemma 5.4 (the genericity-supplied independent extensors come from
`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`). -/

/-- **Around a rigid cycle the relative screws vanish** (`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4,
step): for an infinitesimal motion `S` of a body-hinge framework on the cycle `Fin m` whose `i`-th
edge `e i` links bodies `i` and `i + 1` (cyclically), if the `m` supporting extensors are linearly
independent then consecutive bodies carry the same screw, `S i = S (i + 1)`. Each hinge puts the
difference `S i − S (i + 1)` in `span C(p(e i))`, and the `m` differences telescope around the
cycle to `∑ᵢ (S i − S (i+1)) = 0` (the shift `i ↦ i + 1` is a bijection of `Fin m`,
`Equiv.addRight`); independence then forces each to vanish
(`eq_zero_of_mem_span_singleton_of_sum_eq_zero`). The `m`-edge generalization of the

the target rank at `k'` (`RankHypothesis F k'`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D + k'`) exactly when its
body-`v`-pinned motion subspace has dimension `k'`. This is the `+D` core of the panel-hinge

/-! ## The framework-construction op (`def:framework-with-graph`)

Both inductive cases of Theorem 5.5 build a realization of `G` from a realization of a
*different* graph: Case I from the contraction `G/E(H)`, Case II from the splitting-off
`G_v^{ab}`. The shared, citation-free primitive both need is the ability to keep a hinge
assignment fixed while changing the underlying multigraph. We package this as `withGraph`:
the framework on a new graph `G'` carrying the same hinge map (hence the same supporting
extensors and hinge-row blocks).

The one fact this phase needs from it is the *graph-monotonicity* of the motion space: adding
edges (passing to a supergraph) can only shrink the null space `Z(G,p)`, since each new link
imposes another hinge constraint. Dually, deleting edges — the direction Cases I/II travel,
toward the smaller inductive graph — can only enlarge it. This is the combinatorial companion
to the span-monotonicity Lemma 5.2 (`infinitesimalMotions_mono_of_span_le`, fixed graph,
refining spans); together they bound how `rank R(G,p)` moves under the two ways a realization's
data can change. The base identity `withGraph_supportExtensor` (the hinge data, hence every
extensor, is untouched) is what lets the two compose. -/

/-- **The framework on a new graph** (`def:framework-with-graph`): replace the underlying
multigraph of `F` by `G'`, keeping the hinge assignment — hence every supporting extensor
`C(p(e))`, hinge-row block `r(p(e))`, and per-edge constraint. This is the carrier for the
inductive constructions of Cases I and II, which realize a *different* graph (the contraction
`G/E(H)`, the splitting-off `G_v^{ab}`) on the same hinge data of the parent framework. -/

/-- **Graph monotonicity of the motion space** (`lem:motions-mono-of-graph-le`): a supergraph
imposes more hinge constraints, so its null space is contained in the subgraph's. If
`F'.graph ≤ F.graph` and `F'` carries the same hinge data as `F` (the supporting extensors
agree), then every infinitesimal motion of `F` is one of `F'`:
`F.infinitesimalMotions ≤ F'.infinitesimalMotions`. A motion of `F` meets the constraint at
every link of `F.graph`; each link of the smaller `F'.graph` is one of `F.graph`
(`Graph.IsLink.mono`), and the matching extensors carry the same constraint, so it meets every
constraint of `F'`.

The phase reaches this through `withGraph`: `F.infinitesimalMotions ≤ (F.withGraph G').

/-! ## Block-pinning a rigid subgraph (`def:pinned-motions-on`, Case I infra)

Case I of Theorem 5.5 contracts a *proper rigid subgraph* `H`: every body of `V(H)` collapses
to a single body of the contraction `G/E(H)`. The framework-side carrier of that move is
**block-pinning** — fixing the screws of *all* bodies of `V(H)` to zero, the set-level analogue
of `pinnedMotions v`. We package it as `pinnedMotionsOn s`, the infinitesimal motions vanishing
on every body of `s`; pinning a single body is the special case `s = {v}`
(`pinnedMotionsOn_singleton`), and the block pin is the infimum of the single-body pins over
`s` (`pinnedMotionsOn_eq_iInf`). This is the framework primitive Case I's block-triangular
gluing runs on; its `+D·|V(H)|`-style rank accounting (the generalization of the pin-a-body
identity `finrank_pinnedMotions_add_screwDim`) lands with the contraction realization once the
rigid block is placed. -/

/-- **Block-pinning at a set of bodies** (`def:pinned-motions-on`): the infinitesimal motions
`S` vanishing on *every* body of `s ⊆ α`, `∀ v ∈ s, S v = 0`. Fixing a whole block of bodies to
the zero screw is the algebraic effect of contracting them to one pinned body — the move Case I
makes on a rigid subgraph `H` (pin all of `V(H)`). Generalizes the single-body pin
`pinnedMotions v` (`pinnedMotionsOn_singleton`); carried as the submodule of
`infinitesimalMotions` cut out by the conjunction of vanishing conditions. -/

§6.2/6.3/6.5 Lemmas 6.2, 6.3, 6.5; GREEN-modulo the Phase-21b genericity device). Let `F` be a
body-hinge framework on the parent graph `G = F.graph` carrying a proper rigid subgraph `H` on the
(nonempty) body set `s = V(H)`. Contracting `H` to a single pinned body is the block pin
`pinnedMotionsOn s`, and Case I builds the realization of `G` from a realization of the contraction
`G/E(H)` (a smaller minimal `k`-dof-graph, `lem:contraction-minimality`, green) glued
block-triangularly with the pinned rigid block. Then `F` realizes the target rank at `k'`
(`RankHypothesis k'`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D + k'`) **iff** the block pin has dimension `k'` — the
contraction's inductive rank.

This is the genericity-free assembly of Case I, the parallel of the Case II 1-extension
`rankHypothesis_withNormal_withGraph_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions`. The genericity-free skeleton is
the block-pin lower bound `screwDim_add_finrank_pinnedMotionsOn_le` (the `D`-dimensional trivial
motions and the block pin are disjoint inside `Z(G,p)`, so `D + dim Z_s ≤ dim Z`, always). The

to an equality, `dim Z(G,p) ≤ D + dim Z_s(G,p)` (the reverse inequality — KT's Claim 6.4 that the
combined rigidity matrix attains the sum of the two block ranks, the generic-position step lifting
a single good realization to a generic one). That is *not* automatic: it holds only at the generic
point the Claim 6.4 rank/dimension count selects. Taking `hglue` as an explicit hypothesis makes
`lem:case-I` GREEN-modulo-21b: combined with the green lower bound it pins
`dim Z(G,p) = D + dim Z_s`, so the realization count is exactly the contraction's block-pinned

*equal* those on the smaller graph `G'` — `F.pinnedMotions v = (F.withGraph G').pinnedMotions v` —
provided every base-`v`-pinned motion of `F.withGraph G'` already satisfies the hinge constraint of
each *re-added* edge (every link `e u w` of `F.graph` that is not a link of `G'`), the hypothesis
`hnew`. The `≤` direction is the unconditional `pinnedMotions_le_withGraph` (re-adding edges only
shrinks the pin); the reverse `≥` is exactly `hnew` — a base-pinned motion `S` (with `S v = 0`) is
parent-pinned iff it meets the two new `v`-incident constraints `S a ∈ span C(e_a)`,
`S b ∈ span C(e_b)`. That is the honest content of Claim 6.9's general position: the splitting-off
`G_v^{ab} = G'` carries `v`'s two new hinge edges `e_a, e_b` (the only links of `F.graph` outside
`G'`), and `hnew` is the requirement that the inductive base motions clear them — supplied
downstream by placing the two new supporting extensors in general position
(`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`). The constraints of edges already in `G'` are met
automatically (the supporting extensors are untouched by `withGraph`,
`withGraph_supportExtensor`). Composing with the `+D` rank-lift
`rankHypothesis_withNormal_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions` closes `lem:case-II`'s rank step up to the

the genericity-gated equality). In the splitting-off 1-extension the only links of `F.graph`
outside the smaller graph `G'` are the two new hinge edges *incident to* `v` (KT 2011 §6.3:
splitting-off at a degree-2 vertex `v` re-adds exactly the edges `v–a` and `v–b`). For a
base-`v`-pinned motion `S` (so `S v = 0`), the hinge constraint of such a `v`-incident edge
`e` linking `v w` is `S v − S w = −S w ∈ span C(e)`, i.e. just `S w ∈ span C(e)` — the
difference collapses because the pinned body contributes zero. So the full `hnew` hypothesis
of `pinnedMotions_withGraph_eq` follows from: (a) every out-of-`G'` link of `F.graph` is
incident to `v` (`hinc`), and (b) for each such link `e v w` the non-`v` endpoint `w` already
lands in the new edge's hinge span (`hspan`). This is the brick that turns the abstract
`hnew` into the concrete two-edge condition the genericity device (Claim 6.9, supplied by
`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`) discharges: it isolates the *single* span-membership
per new edge that general position must achieve, stripping the relative-screw difference. The
`hingeConstraint_comm` orients each link so `v` sits on the left, then `S v = 0` and
`Submodule.neg_mem_iff` reduce the membership to `hspan`. -/

/-! ## The panel-hinge framework (`def:panel-hinge-framework`)

Katoh–Tanigawa's *panel-hinge* framework is a **hinge-coplanar** body-hinge framework: at each
body `v`, all incident hinges lie in a common hyperplane `panel(v)` (KT 2011 p.647). We carry
the panel-data form (`DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge = hinge-coplanar body-hinge*): a
`PanelHingeFramework` assigns each body `v` a hyperplane *normal* `normal v ∈ ℝ^(k+2)`, and the
hinge at an edge `e = uv` is the codimension-2 intersection `panel(u) ∩ panel(v)`, whose
supporting `k`-extensor is the Grassmann–Cayley meet `panelSupportExtensor (normal u) (normal v)`
(`def:panel-support-extensor`). Because each edge's two endpoints are not a function of the edge
alone in mathlib's relational `Graph`, the structure also carries an explicit endpoint selector
`ends : β → α × α`; the supporting extensor of `e` is the meet of the two normals at `ends e`.

The body-hinge interpretation `toBodyHinge` (`def:panel-hinge-framework`) feeds this support
extensor into the Phase-18 rigidity-matrix rank theory verbatim: it is the `BodyHingeFramework`
with `supportExtensor e = panelSupportExtensor (normal u) (normal v)` at `(u,v) = ends e`. Every
incident hinge at `v` is then a meet whose join factor includes `normal v`, so it lies in the
panel `panel(v) = {normal v}^⊥` by construction — coplanarity is structural, with no
affine-intersection plumbing. The coplanarity *spec* `IsHingeCoplanar` on a bare
`BodyHingeFramework` is exactly "arises as a `toBodyHinge`", automatic for the panel
constructions of Theorem 5.5 (`isHingeCoplanar_toBodyHinge`). -/

/-- A **`d = k+1`-dimensional panel-hinge framework** (`def:panel-hinge-framework`;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011): a multigraph `G : Graph α β` together with a per-body *panel normal*
`normal v ∈ ℝ^(k+2)` (the pole of body `v`'s hyperplane `panel(v)`) and an endpoint selector
`ends : β → α × α` for the edges. The hinge at edge `e` is the codimension-2 intersection of the
two panels at `ends e`; its supporting `k`-extensor is the meet `panelSupportExtensor` of the two
normals (`def:panel-support-extensor`). Unlike `BodyHingeFramework`'s free hinges, every hinge
incident to `v` lies in the single panel `panel(v)` — the hinge-coplanarity that *defines* the
panel-hinge (molecular) model. -/

/-! ## Cycle realizations (`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4 — panel content)

Katoh–Tanigawa's Lemma 5.4 (the geometric content of Crapo–Whiteley 1982 Prop 3.4 / Whiteley
1999 Kluwer Prop 3): a cycle graph `G = (V, E)` with `3 ≤ |V| ≤ D` has an infinitesimally rigid,
nonparallel *panel*-hinge realization `(G, p)` — equivalently a realization at the full rank
`D(|V|−1)`, the target rank of the minimal `0`-dof case (`RankHypothesis 0`). Geometrically a
cycle of `m` panels and `m` hinges is rigid exactly when its `m` supporting `k`-extensors are
linearly independent in the `D`-dimensional screw space `ScrewSpace k`, which a generic choice of
the `m` panel normals achieves whenever `m ≤ D` (the dimension bound `3 ≤ |V| ≤ D`).

This file lands the **short-cycle base** of that statement: the panel analogue of the two-body
base case `theorem_55_base`, lifted through `toBodyHinge`. A `PanelHingeFramework` on a two-body
cover whose two edges' panel support extensors are independent has an infinitesimally rigid
body-hinge interpretation, i.e. realizes `RankHypothesis 0` at the full rank `D`. The general
cycle (`|V| ≥ 3`) and the generic-panel independence argument that supplies the linearly
independent supporting extensors (bottoming on the extensor-independence Lemma 2.1, Phase 17)
remain red — that is the genericity device (Claim 6.4/6.9) shared with Cases I/II. -/

equivalently `P.toBodyHinge` is infinitesimally rigid, at the full rank `D = D(2−1) − 0`. This is
the brick the general panel-cycle realization (KT Lemma 5.4, `|V| ≥ 3`) is built from; the
linearly independent panel extensors are supplied generically (Claim 6.4/6.9, deferred). Immediate

/-! ## Setting the panel normal at one body (`def:panel-hinge-framework`, Case II infra)

Case II of Theorem 5.5 re-inserts a reducible degree-2 body `v` into the splitting-off
`G_v^{ab}`: it builds a panel realization of the larger graph `G` from one of `G_v^{ab}` by
*choosing a panel normal for `v`* (the two new hinges at `v` are the meets of `panel(v)` with
the panels of its two neighbours `a, b`). The framework-side carrier of that move is
`withNormal v n`: override the panel normal at the single body `v` by `n`, leaving the
multigraph, the endpoint selector, and every other body's normal fixed. This is the per-body
analogue of `withGraph` (which swaps the whole graph) and the panel-data primitive the
1-extension is assembled from; combined with `withGraph` (to enlarge the graph by `v`'s two new
edges) it produces the extended panel realization whose rank Case II accounts for via the `+D`
rank-lift `rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions`. -/

Lemma 6.8): the panel-hinge $1$-extension realizes the target rank at `k'` exactly when the
splitting-off carries pinned-motion dimension `k'`. Building the extended panel framework on `G`
by choosing a panel normal `n` for the re-inserted body `v` (`withNormal v n`), the extended
framework realizes the rank hypothesis at `k'` (`RankHypothesis k'`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D + k'`)
exactly when the *original* framework's body-`v`-pinned motions have dimension `k'` —
`(P.withNormal v n).toBodyHinge.RankHypothesis k' ↔ finrank (P.toBodyHinge.pinnedMotions v) = k'` —
provided `v` is yet unhinged in `P.graph` (no linking edge has `v` among its endpoints, `hv`). The
$+D$ rank-lift `rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions` re-inserts `v`'s `D` screw freedoms, and
the choice of `v`'s panel does not disturb the inductive null space when `v` is unhinged
(`toBodyHinge_withNormal_pinnedMotions_eq`). So a realization of the splitting-off `G_v^{ab}` at
its inductive count — measured by its `v`-pinned dimension `k'` — lifts to a realization of `G` at
the same `k'`. What remains of Case II is *adding* `v`'s two new hinge edges to the graph (via
`withGraph`) and the genericity step (Claim 6.9) ensuring the two new supporting extensors are in
general position, deferred with the genericity device. -/

Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.3 Lemmas 6.7/6.8; GREEN-modulo the Phase-21b genericity device). Let `P`
be a panel-hinge framework on the splitting-off graph `G_v^{ab} = P.graph`, in which the
re-inserted body `v` is *yet unhinged* (no linking edge has `v` among its endpoints, `hv`), and
let `G` be the parent graph with `P.graph ≤ G`. Choosing a panel normal `n` for `v` and enlarging
the graph to `G` produces the extended panel framework `(P.withNormal v n).withGraph G` — the
panel-hinge analogue of Whiteley's bar-joint `1`-extension. Then the extended framework realizes
the target rank at `k'` (`RankHypothesis k'`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D + k'`) **iff** the original
splitting-off framework `P` carries body-`v`-pinned-motion dimension `k'` — so the inductive
realization of `G_v^{ab}` lifts to `G`, the two new hinge-row blocks accounting for the `+D`
(`rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions`, the pin-a-body Lemma 5.1).

This is the genericity-free assembly of Case II: it wires the vertex-level splitting-off
op `G_v^{ab}` (green in Phase 20) into the panel `withNormal`/`withGraph` carriers through the
rank-lift accounting (`rankHypothesis_withNormal_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions` via the unhinged-`v`
invariance `toBodyHinge_withNormal_pinnedMotions_eq`) and the genericity-gated tightness
(`toBodyHinge_pinnedMotions_withGraph_eq`, the `≥` half). The two graph-side hypotheses are
genericity-free: `hv` (`v` unhinged in `G_v^{ab}`, true before its two new edges are added) and
`hinc` (every link of `G` lost on passing to `G_v^{ab}` is `v`-incident — the
`isLink_incident_of_not_removeVertex` brick at the common lower bound, here `G_v^{ab}` itself). The
**one** input from the Phase-21b device is `hspan`: each base-`v`-pinned motion lands in the two
new edges' panel-support spans (`S a ∈ span C(e_a)`, `S b ∈ span C(e_b)`). That is *false
pointwise* — it holds only for the general-position normals the genericity rank/dimension count
(Claim 6.9) selects, supplied by `exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`. Taking `hspan` as an
explicit hypothesis makes `lem:case-II` GREEN-modulo-21b. The `S w ∈ span C(e)` form (rather than
the full hinge constraint `S v − S w ∈ span C(e)`) is the collapse a base-pinned `S v = 0` already

/-! ## Theorem 5.5: realization at the target rank (`thm:theorem-55`)

The capstone of Phase 21. Where the combinatorial induction (Phase 20,
`Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction`, KT Theorem 4.9) reduced every minimal `0`-dof-graph to the
two-vertex double edge, this theorem *realizes* that reduction at the rigidity-matrix rank:
every minimal `0`-dof-graph `G` with `|V| ≥ 2` carries a panel-hinge realization of the full
rank `D(|V|−1)`, i.e. an infinitesimally rigid panel-hinge framework `(G,p)` (Katoh–Tanigawa
2011 §5, Theorem 5.5, at `k = 0`).

The proof is the genericity-free assembly over the Phase-20 reduction dichotomy: it runs the
well-founded induction principle `Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction` against the *realization*
motive `HasFullRankRealization` (`∃ Q, Q.graph = G ∧ Q.toBodyHinge.RankHypothesis 0`),
discharging its three premises with the base case (`lem:theorem-55-base`), the splitting-off
1-extension (Case II, `lem:case-II`), and the rigid-subgraph contraction (Case I, `lem:case-I`).
The two inductive cases are GREEN-modulo-21b — each lands the iff-realization `RankHypothesis ↔
pinned dimension` taking its genericity input (the general-position panel normals of Claim
6.9/6.4) as an explicit hypothesis — so the induction *itself* is genericity-free and inherits
the Phase-21b citation transitively through the cases. The per-case realization steps are taken
here as hypotheses (`hbase`/`hsplit`/`hcontract`), the shape the consumer assembles from the
panel capstones `toBodyHinge_rankHypothesis_zero_cycle` (base), the Case II
`rankHypothesis_withNormal_withGraph_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions`, and the Case I
`toBodyHinge_rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotionsOn` once the genericity device supplies the
general-position normals; Case III (`k = 0`, no proper rigid subgraph) closes the dichotomy and
is deferred to Phases 22–23. -/

/-- **Theorem 5.5: every minimal `0`-dof-graph has a full-rank panel realization**
(`thm:theorem-55`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §5, Theorem 5.5, at `k = 0`). For the molecular regime
`D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 3` (so `n ≥ 2`) and a freshness supply of edge labels (`hfresh`), every
minimal `0`-dof-graph `G` with `2 ≤ |V(G)|` admits a panel-hinge framework `Q` on `G` whose
body-hinge interpretation is infinitesimally rigid
(`PanelHingeFramework.HasFullRankRealization k G` — full rank `D(|V|−1)`).

This is the genericity-free assembly over Phase 20's reduction dichotomy
(`Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction`): the realization motive `HasFullRankRealization k` is closed
under the two-vertex base case (`hbase`, `lem:theorem-55-base`), splitting off a reducible
degree-2 vertex (`hsplit`, Case II `lem:case-II`), and contracting a proper rigid subgraph

(`PanelHingeFramework.rankHypothesis_withNormal_withGraph_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions` for Case II,
`PanelHingeFramework.toBodyHinge_rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotionsOn` for Case I) takes the
general-position panel normals of Claim 6.9/6.4 (the Phase-21b genericity device) as an explicit
hypothesis — so the three realization steps are taken here as hypotheses and the induction itself
is genericity-free, inheriting the Phase-21b citation transitively. Case III (`k = 0`, no proper
rigid subgraph) closes the dichotomy combinatorially inside `minimal_kdof_reduction` and is

/-! ## Proposition 1.1, analytic half: generic rank `= D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`
(`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`)

The last red node of Phase 21. Katoh–Tanigawa's Proposition 1.1 reconciles the *honest*
panel-hinge rigidity-matrix rank `R(G,p)` of `Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean` (Phase 18) with the
combinatorial deficiency `def(G̃)` of `Molecular/Deficiency.lean` (Phase 19): for a generic
panel-hinge realization `(G,p)`,
`rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)` (Jackson–Jordán 2009 Thm 6.1, geometric side).

The **matroidal half** — `def(G̃) = corank M(G̃)`, equivalently `|B| + def(G̃) = D(|V|−1)` for
any base `B` of `M(G̃)` — landed green in Phase 19 (`Graph.rank_add_deficiency_eq`,
`Graph.isBase_ncard_add_deficiency_eq`). This file lands the **analytic half**, the bridge from
the rank `R(G,p)` to the deficiency, in the basis-free codimension convention of Phase 18: `rank
R(G,p) = D|V| − dim Z(G,p)` (`finrank_screwAssignment`), so the target equality `rank R(G,p) =
D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)` is precisely `dim Z(G,p) = D + def(G̃)`, i.e. `F.RankHypothesis (def(G̃))`
(`def:rank-hypothesis`, at `k' = def`).

It is **GREEN-modulo the Phase-21b genericity device**, assembled from the two inequalities that
pin the equality, in the established idiom of Cases I/II (`hglue`, `hspan`):

* *Genericity-free upper bound* `hub` (`rank R(G,p) ≤ D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`, equivalently `D +
  def(G̃) ≤ dim Z(G,p)`): the codimension form `lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound` together with the
  deficiency count. A vertex partition `P` attaining `def(G̃)` contracts each part to one effective
  body, leaving `D(|P|−1) − (D−1)·d_G(P) = partitionDef` independent screw freedoms in the null
  space beyond the `D` trivial motions; maximizing over `P` gives `def(G̃)` extra motions. This is
  genuine genericity-free content (no max-rank assumption — *every* realization has at least this
  many motions), still to be bricked from the Phase-19 partition machinery; carried here as an
  explicit hypothesis so the node is not blocked on it.
* *From Phase 21b (cited)* `hgen` (`rank R(G,p) ≥ D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`, equivalently `dim Z(G,p) ≤ D
  + def(G̃)`): the generic max-rank lower bound — Theorem 5.5 (`theorem_55`) pushed from minimal
  `k`-dof-graphs to all multigraphs by deleting down to a minimal `k`-dof spanning subgraph and
  observing that re-adding edges only grows the rank (`lem:motions-mono-of-graph-le`). The
  generic-rank argument (Claim 6.4) selects the point attaining this max; that is the Phase-21b
  device. -/

/-! ## The genericity device (Claim 6.4/6.9) (`lem:genericity-device`, Phase 21b)

The shared analytic crux of Cases I/II, Theorem 5.5, Proposition 1.1, and the cycle-realization
assembly — Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.1 Claim 6.4 / §6.3 Claim 6.9. The entries of the panel-hinge
rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` are polynomials in the panel coordinates (the per-vertex normals), so
`rank R(G,p)` is lower semicontinuous and attains its maximum on a Zariski-open (generic) set:
a single realization `(G,p₀)` at a given rank lifts to *at least* that rank at the generic
realization. In the codimension convention of Phase 18 this is the dual statement — `dim Z(G,p)`
is upper semicontinuous, attaining its *minimum* generically.

This file lands the device in the **framework-facing codimension shape** the four consumers
carry (each is a `dim Z(G,p) ≤ target` upper bound, the codimension reading of `rank R ≥ …`),
assembled from the two Phase-21b bricks already in place:

* the analytic engine `LinearIndependent.finrank_dualCoannihilator_along_affine_path_cofinite`
  (`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean`): along an affine path `t ↦ a i + t • b i` of
  *functionals* on a finite-dimensional space, a corank witnessed once at `t₀` (the subfamily
  indexed by `s` independent there) bounds the common kernel's `finrank` cofinitely above by
  `finrank V − #s`;
* the coordinatization `RigidityMatrix.infinitesimalMotions_eq_dualCoannihilator`:
  `Z(G,p) = (span (rigidityRows F)).dualCoannihilator`, the exact `dualCoannihilator`-of-a-span
  shape the engine consumes.

Composing them: if a panel-hinge realization is presented through an affine family of
rigidity-row functionals `t ↦ a i + t • b i` on the screw-assignment space `α → ScrewSpace k`
(with `(F t).infinitesimalMotions` the span's coannihilator at every `t`, the per-framework
coordinatization), and the subfamily `s` is independent at one realization `t₀`, then for
cofinitely many `t` the null space has `dim Z(F t) ≤ D|V| − #s`. The witnessed independent
subfamily `s` is supplied by the existence half `exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`
(`lem:exists-independent-panel-extensor`, Phase 21 green), and `D|V| − #s` is the consumer's
target codimension. The conclusion is stated additively (`D|V| < #s + dim Z`) to sidestep
`ℕ`-subtraction, matching the engine's shape.

The remaining gap to per-consumer wiring (deferred to the next Phase-21b commits) is that the
panel rows are *affine* in this device's single scalar `t`, whereas the supporting extensor
`panelSupportExtensor n_u n_v = complementIso (n_u ∧ n_v)` is *bilinear* in the normals — so a
generic line through panel-coordinate space gives a row family that is quadratic, not affine, in
`t`. Each consumer must therefore present its rows as an affine family along a *chosen* path (the
single-scalar restriction route that worked for Phase 8's uniform-generic placement
`exists_uniform_rowIndependent_placement`), or the engine must be generalized to a multivariate
Zariski-open form; this device fixes the
framework-facing target shape that wiring lands into. -/

/-- **The device's affine coordinatization from an affine *enumeration* of the rigidity rows**
(`lem:genericity-device`, the `hcoord` bridge; Phase 21b). The genericity device `genericityDevice`
takes its affine coordinatization `hcoord` as the per-`t` coannihilator identity
`(F t).infinitesimalMotions = (span (range (a + t • b))).dualCoannihilator`. This lemma supplies
that hypothesis from the more workable input a consumer can actually produce: an affine family of
functionals `t ↦ a i + t • b i` whose span *equals* the span of the rigidity rows `rigidityRows
(F t)` at every `t` (`hspan`). The bridge is the load-bearing coannihilator coordinatization
`infinitesimalMotions_eq_dualCoannihilator`
(`Z(F t) = (span (rigidityRows (F t))).dualCoannihilator`, Phase 18) with `hspan t` rewriting the
span underneath the (monotone, so equality-respecting) `dualCoannihilator`.

This isolates the per-consumer obligation to its *geometric* core — exhibiting an affine family of
row functionals that re-spans the panel rows along a chosen path — from the device's analytic
content: a consumer (Case I, Case II, Prop 1.1) discharges `hcoord` by providing such an `a, b`
with `hspan`, no `dualCoannihilator` bookkeeping. The residual genuinely-open piece is the
construction of `a, b` themselves: the panel rows `hingeRow u v r` depend on `supportExtensor e =
panelSupportExtensor (normal u) (normal v)`, which is *bilinear* in the normals, so the path through
panel-coordinate space must be chosen so the row functionals (not the normals) come out affine
(the Phase-8 single-scalar trick), or the engine generalized to a multivariate Zariski-open form. -/

/-- **The `hspan` of a constant family along a spanning enumeration of one realization's rigidity
rows** (`lem:genericity-device`, the route-(a) closure for Case I; Phase 21b). The route a/b
assessment the hand-off flagged resolves in favour of **route (a) with a degenerate (constant)
affine path**: the witness realization Case I needs is *constructed directly* by the
exterior-algebra existence lemma `exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor` (a basis choice on `⋀²`,
Phase 21/17), not found by perturbing along a genuine line through panel-coordinate space. So the
affine family the device consumes can be the *constant* path `F t = F₀`, with `b = 0` and `a` any
family **spanning** the rigidity rows of the single good realization `F₀` (`hspanrows`). The
bilinearity obstruction (the panel rows are quadratic along a real line through normal-space) never
bites, because no real line is traversed — the device reads off the corank `#s` at the one
hand-built realization, which is all Case I's block-triangular gluing needs.

The index `ι` is kept abstract and `[Finite]` (the engine
`finrank_dualCoannihilator_along_affine_path_cofinite` needs a finite index, and the
finite-dimensional row space admits a finite spanning subfamily): the constant family
`fun t i => a i + t • 0 = a i` has range `range a`, so its span equals `span (rigidityRows F₀)`
by `hspanrows`. This discharges `hcoord_of_rigidityRows_affine`'s `hspan` for the constant family,
hence the device's `hcoord`. The independent subfamily `s` (the device's `hindep`) is then a
linearly independent subfamily of `a`, supplied by `exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor` through
the hinge-row block. -/

`exists_good_realization` / `hglue_of_genericityDevice` fire against a realization produced by
`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor` rather than along a quadratic panel path — the
route-(a) resolution of the bilinearity obstruction (see `hspan_const_of_span_eq`). -/

/-- **Genericity device, codimension form** (`lem:genericity-device`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
Claim 6.4 / Claim 6.9, Phase 21b). Let `F : ℝ → BodyHingeFramework k α β` be a one-parameter
family of frameworks on the same bodies whose null spaces are coordinatized by a single affine
family of rigidity-row functionals `a b : ι → Module.Dual ℝ (α → ScrewSpace k)`: for every `t`,
`(F t).infinitesimalMotions = (span ℝ (range (fun i => a i + t • b i))).dualCoannihilator`
(the per-framework `infinitesimalMotions_eq_dualCoannihilator` after re-indexing
`rigidityRows (F t)` as `i ↦ a i + t • b i`). If the subfamily indexed by `s : Set ι` is
linearly independent at some realization `t₀` — the witnessed rank, supplied by
`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor` — then for all but finitely many `t : ℝ` the null
space has dimension at most `D|V| − #s`:
`D|V| < #s + dim Z(F t)` fails only on a finite set of `t`.

This is the "generic point attains the maximum rank" mechanism the device supplies to its
consumers, re-read as the codimension upper bound `dim Z(G,p) ≤ target` each carries
(`hglue` for Case I, `hspan` for Case II, `hgen` for Proposition 1.1). It is a thin composition
of the analytic engine `finrank_dualCoannihilator_along_affine_path_cofinite` with the
coannihilator coordinatization, with `finrank (α → ScrewSpace k) = D|V|`
(`finrank_screwAssignment`) substituted for the engine's `finrank V`. -/

Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.1 Claim 6.4). The genuinely-consumer-facing form of the genericity device
for Case I, with *all* the affine-path plumbing discharged via the constant family
(`hcoord_const`): given a single body-hinge realization `F₀`, a finite family `a` of functionals
**spanning** its rigidity rows (`hspanrows`), a linearly independent subfamily indexed by `s`
(`hindep`, the witnessed corank, supplied by `exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor` through the

This is the route-(a) resolution promised in the hand-off: the bilinearity obstruction (panel rows
quadratic along a real line) is sidestepped because the witness realization `F₀` is *constructed*
by the exterior-algebra existence lemma rather than reached by perturbation, so the device runs on
the **constant** affine path `F t = F₀` (`hcoord_const`, `hspan_const_of_span_eq`). Composing
`hcoord_const` into `hglue_of_genericityDevice` and reading the resulting `∃ t, …` at the constant

capstone in its consumer-ready form; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.1 Claim 6.4, Phase 21b). The bridge
that feeds the **assembled** independent rigidity-row family of
`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_forest` directly into the block-triangular gluing inequality,
discharging `hglue_of_realization`'s finite-spanning-family `a` and its independent-subfamily index
`s` once and for all.

`hglue_of_realization` is stated against a single finite family `a` that *spans* `F₀.rigidityRows`
together with an independent subfamily indexed by `s ⊆ ι` of `a` itself. The Case-I assembly,
however, produces its independent family `r : κ → Dual` (the `(D−1)·|J|` rows of a rigid block's
spanning forest of transversal hinges) as members of `F₀.rigidityRows` — *not* as a syntactic
subfamily of any pre-chosen spanning enumeration. This lemma closes that index gap with the
**concatenation** `a := Sum.elim r a₀`, where `a₀` is any finite family spanning the rigidity rows
(`exists_finite_spanning_rigidityRows`): its range is `range r ∪ range a₀`, and since `range r ⊆
span F₀.rigidityRows = span (range a₀)`, the concatenated family still spans the rigidity rows
(`hspanrows`); the subfamily indexed by `s := range Sum.inl` is exactly `r` (independent by
`hr`, transported across the `Sum.inl` reindexing). The corank then matches `Nat.card κ` (the
forest's `(D−1)·|J|`), so the route-(a) capstone fires with `hmatch` keyed to `κ` rather than to a
hand-chosen subset of an enumeration.

The residual per-consumer obligations are now exactly two and *both purely geometric*: (i) exhibit
the realization `F₀` (a `PanelHingeFramework`-via-`toBodyHinge` from the contraction realization
plus the rigidly placed block `V(H)`), supplying the forest data `r` via
`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_forest`; and (ii) the count match `hmatch`
(`Nat.card κ = D(|V|−1) − dim Z_s`) against the contraction's inductive `RankHypothesis`. No
spanning-family construction, no subfamily-index bookkeeping, and no affine path remain. -/

/-- **Case I `hglue` from a rigid block's spanning forest** (`lem:case-I`, the route-(a) capstone
in its fully geometry-facing form; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.1 Claim 6.4, §6.2/6.5, Phase 21b). The
last reduction of the route-(a) chain before the genuinely-geometric `F₀` exhibition: it composes
the assembled forest family `exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_forest` (the rigid block's
`(D−1)·|J|` independent rigidity rows, indexed by `Σ _ : J, Fin (screwDim k − 1)`) straight into
the consumer bridge `hglue_of_independent_rigidityRows`, so the only remaining consumer obligation
is the *forest data itself* plus the count.

Concretely: given a single body-hinge realization `F₀` whose rigid block `V(H) = s_blk` carries a
spanning forest of transversal hinges — each hinge `e j` oriented from a *private endpoint* `u j`
(the forest child, `u` injective) to an arbitrary `other j`, with the forest-separation hypothesis
`hsep : ∀ j j', other j ≠ u j'` and every hinge transversal (`he : F₀.supportExtensor (e j) ≠ 0`)
— the block-triangular gluing inequality `hglue : dim Z(G,p) ≤ D + dim Z_s` holds at `F₀`, provided
only the **count match** `hmatch`: the forest's row count `|J|·(D−1)` equals the contraction's
inductive rank `D(|V|−1) − dim Z_s`. The forest rows discharge `hglue_of_independent_rigidityRows`'s
independent family `r` (via `linearIndependent_hingeRow_forest`) and its membership obligation
(each row is in `F₀.rigidityRows` by the hinge link `hlink j`); the cardinality
`Nat.card (Σ _ : J, Fin (screwDim k − 1)) = |J|·(D−1)` (`Nat.card_sigma`) keys `hmatch` to the
forest size.

This is the last *generic* (graph-and-hinge-agnostic) reduction. The remaining consumer work — the
genuinely-geometric Case-I assembly (KT §6.2/6.5) — is to exhibit, from the contraction realization
`G/E(H)` at its inductive `RankHypothesis` plus the rigidly placed block `V(H)`, the single
realization `F₀` (a `PanelHingeFramework`-via-`toBodyHinge`), the private-endpoint spanning forest
`u`/`other`/`e` of `V(H)`'s transversal hinges (transversality from
`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor` general position), and the count `hmatch` against the
contraction's inductive rank. -/
