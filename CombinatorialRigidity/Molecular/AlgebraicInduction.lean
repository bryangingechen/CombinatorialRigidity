# The algebraic induction: Theorem 5.5 base, Cases I & II (`sec:molecular-algebraic-induction`)

Phase 21, the fifth proof stratum of the molecular-conjecture program (Phases 17–26; see
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). Where the combinatorial induction (Phase 20,
`Molecular/Induction.lean`) reduced every minimal `0`-dof-graph to the two-vertex double
edge (Theorem 4.9, `Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction`), this file *realizes* that reduction at
the rigidity-matrix rank: Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 (*A proof of the molecular conjecture*,
Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, §5, §6.1–6.3) **Theorem 5.5** — every minimal `k`-dof-graph
`G` with `|V| ≥ 2` has a panel-hinge realization `(G,p)` with `rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − k` —
its base case, Case I (proper rigid subgraph), and Case II (`k > 0` splitting). The crux
Case III (`k = 0`, no proper rigid subgraph) is deferred to Phases 22–23.

## The panel layer (`def:panel-hinge-framework`)

Katoh–Tanigawa's *panel-hinge* framework is a **hinge-coplanar** body-hinge framework: at
each vertex all incident hinges lie in a common hyperplane (KT 2011 p.647). The conjecture's
content is that this coplanarity constraint can be met *without losing rigidity*. The
Phase-18 `BodyHingeFramework` carries free hinges with no coplanarity, so the
realization-existence nodes need a **panel layer** on top (`DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge =
hinge-coplanar body-hinge*). We take the panel-data form: a panel realization assigns each
body `v` a *hyperplane normal* `nᵥ ∈ ℝ^(k+2)`, and the hinge at an edge `e = uv` is the
codimension-2 intersection `panel(u) ∩ panel(v)` of the two panels. Its supporting
`k`-extensor — the screw-space element `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` the rigidity matrix
constrains — is the Grassmann–Cayley meet of the two panels, equivalently
`complementIso (nᵤ ∧ nᵥ)` (`panelSupportExtensor`): the join `nᵤ ∧ nᵥ` is the grade-2
extensor of the two normals (`normalsJoin`, in `⋀^2 ℝ^(k+2)`), and the complement iso
`complementIso : ⋀^2 V ≃ ⋀^(k+2−2) V = ⋀^k V` (Phase 21a, `Molecular/Meet.lean`) lands it in
`ScrewSpace k`. The only general-position condition — the two panels meet transversally — is
then exactly that the two normals are linearly independent
(`panelSupportExtensor_ne_zero_iff`), so coplanarity and transversality both live in the
extensor algebra and no affine-subspace-intersection plumbing is needed. This is the leaf the
panel layer rests on; the panel framework `PanelHingeFramework`, its body-hinge interpretation
`toBodyHinge`, and the coplanarity spec `IsHingeCoplanar` land on top in subsequent commits.

## The rank-induction nodes

This file lands the `sec:molecular-algebraic-induction` dep-graph in dependency order. The
regime-agnostic rank leaf nodes (retained verbatim under the panel layer):

* `RankHypothesis` (`def:rank-hypothesis`) — the realization hypothesis (6.1). Carried in
  the basis-free form of Phase 18 (`Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean`): the panel-hinge rigidity
  matrix `R(G,p)` is the constraint family cutting out the null space
  `Z(G,p) = F.infinitesimalMotions`, and `rank R(G,p) = D|V| − dim Z(G,p)`
  (`def:rigidity-matrix`'s codimension form, `finrank_screwAssignment`). The target rank
  `rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − k = D|V| − (D + k)` is therefore the null-space dimension
  `dim Z(G,p) = D + k`, the form carried here. (`D = screwDim k`.)
* `theorem_55_base` (`lem:theorem-55-base`) — the `|V| = 2`, `k = 0` base case: the
  two-vertex double edge with two non-parallel hinges (independent supporting extensors)
  realizes the full rank `D = D(2−1) − 0`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D`. The framework is
  infinitesimally rigid (`Z(G,p) = trivialMotions`), so its null space is the `D`-dimensional
  trivial-motion space — exactly the parallel-hinges-full Lemma 5.3
  (`eq_of_hingeConstraint_two_parallel`, Phase 18 green) specialized to the two bodies.

## The rank in basis-free form

Phase 18 carries `rank R(G,p)` as a codimension: the column space is the screw-assignment
space `α → ScrewSpace k` of dimension `D|V|` (`finrank_screwAssignment`), and the null space
is `Z(G,p) = F.infinitesimalMotions`, so `rank R(G,p) = D|V| − dim Z(G,p)`. Rather than carry
the `ℤ`-valued rank and re-derive the column count at each node, the realization hypothesis is
stated directly on the null-space dimension: `RankHypothesis F k` asserts
`dim Z(G,p) = D + k`, the rearrangement of `rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − k`. The two forms are
interchanged by `finrank_screwAssignment`; the null-space form is the one the rank lemmas of
Phase 18 (`finrank_pinnedMotions_add_screwDim`, `finrank_trivialMotions`) already speak.

/-! ## The panel support extensor (`def:panel-support-extensor`, panel-layer leaf)

A **panel** at a body is a hyperplane of `ℝ^(k+1)`, carried by its normal vector
`n ∈ ℝ^(k+2)` (homogenized). The hinge at an edge `e = uv` is the codimension-2 intersection
`panel(u) ∩ panel(v)` of the two panels; its supporting `k`-extensor — the element of the
screw space `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` that the rigidity matrix constrains — is the
Grassmann–Cayley **meet** of the two panels. Concretely it is `complementIso (n_u ∧ n_v)`:
the join `n_u ∧ n_v` is the grade-2 extensor of the two normals (`normalsJoin`, landing in
`⋀^2 ℝ^(k+2)`), and the complement iso `complementIso : ⋀^2 V ≃ ⋀^(k+2−2) V = ⋀^k V`
(Phase 21a, `Molecular/Meet.lean`) carries it into `ScrewSpace k`.

This is the leaf the whole panel layer rests on: it produces the supporting extensor of a
panel hinge directly from the per-vertex normals, with the only general-position condition —
the two panels meeting transversally — being exactly the linear independence of the two
normals (`panelSupportExtensor_ne_zero_iff`). So coplanarity (both hinges at `v` lie in
`panel(v)` by construction) and transversality both live in the extensor algebra, and the
panel framework `PanelHingeFramework` (subsequent commit) carries only the per-vertex normals
with no affine-subspace-intersection plumbing. -/

/-- **The grade-2 join of two panel normals** (`def:panel-support-extensor`): the wedge
`n₁ ∧ n₂` of two normal vectors of `ℝ^(k+2)`, landing in the grade-2 piece
`⋀^2 ℝ^(k+2)`. The join of the two panels' poles, dual to the codimension-2 intersection of
the panels themselves; the `complementIso` of this is the panel hinge's supporting extensor
(`panelSupportExtensor`). -/

/-- **The join of two panel normals is nonzero iff the normals are independent**

grade-2 extensor of two vectors vanishes exactly when they are linearly dependent
(`extensor_ne_zero_iff_linearIndependent`, Phase 17); this is the algebraic form of the two
panels meeting transversally (their normals not collinear), the only general-position
condition the panel layer needs. -/

/-- **The panel support extensor** of a hinge between two panels with normals `n₁, n₂`
(`def:panel-support-extensor`): the supporting `k`-extensor `C(p(e)) ∈ ScrewSpace k` of the
codimension-2 intersection `panel(u) ∩ panel(v)`, given as the Grassmann–Cayley meet of the
two panels — the complement iso `complementIso : ⋀^2 V ≃ ⋀^(k+2−2) V` (Phase 21a) of their
grade-2 join `normalsJoin n₁ n₂`. The target grade `k + 2 − 2 = k` is exactly the screw-space
grade, so the result lands in `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` and is consumed verbatim by the
Phase-18 hinge constraint. This is the panel-layer source of supporting extensors, replacing
the body-hinge `affineSubspaceExtensor` of the free-hinge model with a coplanar-by-construction
panel hinge. -/

(`def:panel-support-extensor`): `panelSupportExtensor n₁ n₂ ≠ 0 ↔ LinearIndependent ℝ ![n₁, n₂]`.
The complement iso is a linear equivalence (`complementIso`, Phase 21a), so it sends a nonzero
join to a nonzero extensor; combined with `normalsJoin_ne_zero_iff` the supporting extensor is
nonzero exactly when the two panel normals are independent, i.e. the panels meet
transversally in a genuine codimension-2 hinge. This is the general-position hypothesis the
panel realizations of Theorem 5.5 supply (the panel analogue of the body-hinge framework's
`affineSubspaceExtensor_ne_zero_iff`). -/

/-- **Panel support extensor independence reduces to grade-2 join independence**
(`lem:cycle-realization`, the genericity-device reduction): a family of `m` panel support extensors
`i ↦ panelSupportExtensor (n₁ i) (n₂ i)` is linearly independent in the screw space `ScrewSpace k`
exactly when the family of grade-2 joins `i ↦ normalsJoin (n₁ i) (n₂ i)` is independent in
`⋀² ℝ^(k+2)`. Because the complement iso `complementIso : ⋀² V ≃ ⋀^k V` (Phase 21a) is a *linear
equivalence*, it carries independent families to independent families and reflects them.
This is the reduction at the heart of Katoh–Tanigawa's generic-panel independence argument
(Claim 6.4/6.9): the existence of an infinitesimally rigid panel-cycle realization
(`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4) needs `m ≤ D` panel hinges whose supporting extensors are
independent, and this lemma turns that screw-space-independence question into an independence
question on the grade-2 joins of the panel normals — a concrete exterior-power statement that a
basis choice on `⋀²` (the panel-normal analogue of a generic point, bottoming on the
extensor-independence Lemma 2.1) discharges, with `m ≤ D = dim ⋀² ℝ^(k+2)` the dimension cap
(`card_le_screwDim_of_supportExtensor_linearIndependent`). -/

/-- **Existence of an independent grade-2-join family for a cycle of `m ≤ D` panels**
(`lem:cycle-realization`, the genericity-device existence half; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Claim 6.4/6.9):
for any `m ≤ D = screwDim k` there are `m` pairs of panel normals whose grade-2 joins
`i ↦ normalsJoin (n₁ i) (n₂ i)` are linearly independent in `⋀² ℝ^(k+2)`. This is the
exterior-algebraic core of the generic-panel independence argument: rather than a real-polynomial
perturbation, the witness is a *basis choice* — pick `m` distinct 2-element subsets of `Fin (k+2)`
(possible since the index set `Set.powersetCard (Fin (k+2)) 2` has cardinality
`(k+2).choose 2 = D ≥ m`) and take the corresponding pairs of standard basis vectors. Each join is
then a member of the basis-indexed exterior-power family
(`normalsJoin_basisFun_orderEmbOfFin`), and that whole family is linearly independent
(`exteriorPower.ιMulti_family_linearIndependent_ofBasis`, the `⋀²`-basis fact bottoming on the
extensor-independence Lemma 2.1, Phase 17), so the chosen subfamily inherits independence via the
injection of indices. Combined with `panelSupportExtensor_linearIndependent_iff` this supplies the
independent supporting extensors KT Lemma 5.4 needs for a rigid panel-cycle realization, the
existence half of `lem:cycle-realization` that the dimension bound
`card_le_screwDim_of_supportExtensor_linearIndependent` caps from above. -/

/-! ## The `m`-body cycle base (`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4)

The general (`m`-body) panel-cycle realization. A cycle of `m` bodies `0, 1, …, m−1` (carried as
`Fin m`) and `m` hinges, the `i`-th joining body `i` to body `i + 1` (cyclically, `Graph.IsLink
(e i) i (i + 1)`), is infinitesimally rigid exactly when its `m` supporting extensors are
linearly independent. The argument propagates `S u = S v` around the cycle: each hinge constraint
puts the relative screw `S i − S (i + 1)` in the one-dimensional span of `C(p(e i))`, and these
`m` differences telescope around the cycle to `∑ᵢ (S i − S (i+1)) = 0` (the rotation `i ↦ i + 1`
is a bijection of `Fin m`). Independence of the `m` extensors then forces every difference to
vanish (`eq_zero_of_mem_span_singleton_of_sum_eq_zero`, the `m`-edge generalization of the
parallel-hinges-full Lemma 5.3), so `S` is constant on the connected cycle — a trivial motion.
This is the `m`-body generalization of the two-body base case `theorem_55_base`; together with the
dimension bound `card_le_screwDim_of_linearIndependent` (`3 ≤ m ≤ D`) it is the cycle realization
of KT Lemma 5.4 (the genericity-supplied independent extensors come from
`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`). -/

/-- **Around a rigid cycle the relative screws vanish** (`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4,
step): for an infinitesimal motion `S` of a body-hinge framework on the cycle `Fin m` whose `i`-th
edge `e i` links bodies `i` and `i + 1` (cyclically), if the `m` supporting extensors are linearly
independent then consecutive bodies carry the same screw, `S i = S (i + 1)`. Each hinge puts the
difference `S i − S (i + 1)` in `span C(p(e i))`, and the `m` differences telescope around the
cycle to `∑ᵢ (S i − S (i+1)) = 0` (the shift `i ↦ i + 1` is a bijection of `Fin m`,
`Equiv.addRight`); independence then forces each to vanish
(`eq_zero_of_mem_span_singleton_of_sum_eq_zero`). The `m`-edge generalization of the
relative-screw step in `theorem_55_base`. -/

the target rank at `k'` (`RankHypothesis F k'`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D + k'`) exactly when its
body-`v`-pinned motion subspace has dimension `k'`. This is the `+D` core of the panel-hinge

/-! ## The framework-construction op (`def:framework-with-graph`)

Both inductive cases of Theorem 5.5 build a realization of `G` from a realization of a
*different* graph: Case I from the contraction `G/E(H)`, Case II from the splitting-off
`G_v^{ab}`. The shared, citation-free primitive both need is the ability to keep a hinge
assignment fixed while changing the underlying multigraph. We package this as `withGraph`:
the framework on a new graph `G'` carrying the same hinge map (hence the same supporting
extensors and hinge-row blocks).

The one fact this phase needs from it is the *graph-monotonicity* of the motion space: adding
edges (passing to a supergraph) can only shrink the null space `Z(G,p)`, since each new link
imposes another hinge constraint. Dually, deleting edges — the direction Cases I/II travel,
toward the smaller inductive graph — can only enlarge it. This is the combinatorial companion
to the span-monotonicity Lemma 5.2 (`infinitesimalMotions_mono_of_span_le`, fixed graph,
refining spans); together they bound how `rank R(G,p)` moves under the two ways a realization's
data can change. The base identity `withGraph_supportExtensor` (the hinge data, hence every
extensor, is untouched) is what lets the two compose. -/

/-- **The framework on a new graph** (`def:framework-with-graph`): replace the underlying
multigraph of `F` by `G'`, keeping the hinge assignment — hence every supporting extensor
`C(p(e))`, hinge-row block `r(p(e))`, and per-edge constraint. This is the carrier for the
inductive constructions of Cases I and II, which realize a *different* graph (the contraction
`G/E(H)`, the splitting-off `G_v^{ab}`) on the same hinge data of the parent framework. -/

imposes more hinge constraints, so its null space is contained in the subgraph's. If
`F'.graph ≤ F.graph` and `F'` carries the same hinge data as `F` (the supporting extensors
agree), then every infinitesimal motion of `F` is one of `F'`:
`F.infinitesimalMotions ≤ F'.infinitesimalMotions`. A motion of `F` meets the constraint at
every link of `F.graph`; each link of the smaller `F'.graph` is one of `F.graph`
(`Graph.IsLink.mono`), and the matching extensors carry the same constraint, so it meets every
constraint of `F'`.

/-! ## Block-pinning a rigid subgraph (`def:pinned-motions-on`, Case I infra)

Case I of Theorem 5.5 contracts a *proper rigid subgraph* `H`: every body of `V(H)` collapses
to a single body of the contraction `G/E(H)`. The framework-side carrier of that move is
**block-pinning** — fixing the screws of *all* bodies of `V(H)` to zero, the set-level analogue
of `pinnedMotions v`. We package it as `pinnedMotionsOn s`, the infinitesimal motions vanishing
on every body of `s`; pinning a single body is the special case `s = {v}`
(`pinnedMotionsOn_singleton`), and the block pin is the infimum of the single-body pins over
`s` (`pinnedMotionsOn_eq_iInf`). This is the framework primitive Case I's block-triangular
gluing runs on; its `+D·|V(H)|`-style rank accounting (the generalization of the pin-a-body
identity `finrank_pinnedMotions_add_screwDim`) lands with the contraction realization once the
rigid block is placed. -/

/-- **Block-pinning at a set of bodies** (`def:pinned-motions-on`): the infinitesimal motions
`S` vanishing on *every* body of `s ⊆ α`, `∀ v ∈ s, S v = 0`. Fixing a whole block of bodies to
the zero screw is the algebraic effect of contracting them to one pinned body — the move Case I
makes on a rigid subgraph `H` (pin all of `V(H)`). Generalizes the single-body pin
`pinnedMotions v` (`pinnedMotionsOn_singleton`); carried as the submodule of
`infinitesimalMotions` cut out by the conjunction of vanishing conditions. -/

/-! ## The panel-hinge framework (`def:panel-hinge-framework`)

Katoh–Tanigawa's *panel-hinge* framework is a **hinge-coplanar** body-hinge framework: at each
body `v`, all incident hinges lie in a common hyperplane `panel(v)` (KT 2011 p.647). We carry
the panel-data form (`DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge = hinge-coplanar body-hinge*): a
`PanelHingeFramework` assigns each body `v` a hyperplane *normal* `normal v ∈ ℝ^(k+2)`, and the
hinge at an edge `e = uv` is the codimension-2 intersection `panel(u) ∩ panel(v)`, whose
supporting `k`-extensor is the Grassmann–Cayley meet `panelSupportExtensor (normal u) (normal v)`
(`def:panel-support-extensor`). Because each edge's two endpoints are not a function of the edge
alone in mathlib's relational `Graph`, the structure also carries an explicit endpoint selector
`ends : β → α × α`; the supporting extensor of `e` is the meet of the two normals at `ends e`.

The body-hinge interpretation `toBodyHinge` (`def:panel-hinge-framework`) feeds this support
extensor into the Phase-18 rigidity-matrix rank theory verbatim: it is the `BodyHingeFramework`
with `supportExtensor e = panelSupportExtensor (normal u) (normal v)` at `(u,v) = ends e`. Every
incident hinge at `v` is then a meet whose join factor includes `normal v`, so it lies in the
panel `panel(v) = {normal v}^⊥` by construction — coplanarity is structural, with no
affine-intersection plumbing. The coplanarity *spec* `IsHingeCoplanar` on a bare
`BodyHingeFramework` is exactly "arises as a `toBodyHinge`", automatic for the panel
constructions of Theorem 5.5 (`isHingeCoplanar_toBodyHinge`). -/

`normal v ∈ ℝ^(k+2)` (the pole of body `v`'s hyperplane `panel(v)`) and an endpoint selector
`ends : β → α × α` for the edges. The hinge at edge `e` is the codimension-2 intersection of the
two panels at `ends e`; its supporting `k`-extensor is the meet `panelSupportExtensor` of the two
normals (`def:panel-support-extensor`). Unlike `BodyHingeFramework`'s free hinges, every hinge
incident to `v` lies in the single panel `panel(v)` — the hinge-coplanarity that *defines* the

/-- **The panel framework on a new graph** (`def:framework-with-graph`, panel layer): replace the
underlying multigraph of `P` by `G'`, keeping the per-body panel normals `normal` and the endpoint
selector `ends` — hence every panel support extensor. The panel analogue of
`BodyHingeFramework.withGraph`, and the shared carrier both inductive cases of Theorem 5.5 need on
the panel layer: Case I realizes the contraction `G/E(H)` and Case II the splitting-off `G_v^{ab}`
on the *same* panel data of the parent framework. Because the normals are untouched, the
hinge-coplanarity is preserved: every hinge of `P.withGraph G'` incident to a body `v` still lies in
the single panel `panel(v) = {normal v}^⊥`. -/

the body-hinge `withGraph` of the original's interpretation — both carry the same multigraph `G'`
and the same panel support extensors (the normals and endpoint selector are unchanged by either
`withGraph`). This is the bridge that lets the green body-hinge graph-monotonicity and block-pin
rank machinery (`infinitesimalMotions_le_withGraph_of_le`, `pinnedMotionsOn_le_withGraph_of_le`,
`screwDim_add_finrank_pinnedMotionsOn_le`) apply verbatim to a panel realization placed on the

/-! ## Cycle realizations (`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4 — panel content)

Katoh–Tanigawa's Lemma 5.4 (the geometric content of Crapo–Whiteley 1982 Prop 3.4 / Whiteley
1999 Kluwer Prop 3): a cycle graph `G = (V, E)` with `3 ≤ |V| ≤ D` has an infinitesimally rigid,
nonparallel *panel*-hinge realization `(G, p)` — equivalently a realization at the full rank
`D(|V|−1)`, the target rank of the minimal `0`-dof case (`RankHypothesis 0`). Geometrically a
cycle of `m` panels and `m` hinges is rigid exactly when its `m` supporting `k`-extensors are
linearly independent in the `D`-dimensional screw space `ScrewSpace k`, which a generic choice of
the `m` panel normals achieves whenever `m ≤ D` (the dimension bound `3 ≤ |V| ≤ D`).

This file lands the **short-cycle base** of that statement: the panel analogue of the two-body
base case `theorem_55_base`, lifted through `toBodyHinge`. A `PanelHingeFramework` on a two-body
cover whose two edges' panel support extensors are independent has an infinitesimally rigid
body-hinge interpretation, i.e. realizes `RankHypothesis 0` at the full rank `D`. The general
cycle (`|V| ≥ 3`) and the generic-panel independence argument that supplies the linearly
independent supporting extensors (bottoming on the extensor-independence Lemma 2.1, Phase 17)
remain red — that is the genericity device (Claim 6.4/6.9) shared with Cases I/II. -/

/-- **Short-cycle base of the panel cycle realization** (`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4):
the panel analogue of `theorem_55_base`, lifted through `toBodyHinge`. A panel-hinge framework `P`
on a two-body cover (`hcover : ∀ w, w = u ∨ w = v`, `huv : u ≠ v`) with two edges `e₁, e₂` joining
`u` and `v` (`h₁ : P.graph.IsLink e₁ u v`, `h₂ : …`) whose panel support extensors are linearly
independent (`hgen`) has a body-hinge interpretation realizing the rank hypothesis at `k' = 0` —
equivalently `P.toBodyHinge` is infinitesimally rigid, at the full rank `D = D(2−1) − 0`. This is
the brick the general panel-cycle realization (KT Lemma 5.4, `|V| ≥ 3`) is built from; the
linearly independent panel extensors are supplied generically (Claim 6.4/6.9, deferred). Immediate
from `BodyHingeFramework.theorem_55_base` applied to `P.toBodyHinge`. -/

/-- **A rigid panel cycle has at most `D` hinges** (`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4, the
`|V| ≤ D` bound): if the supporting extensors of `m` edges of a panel-hinge framework are linearly
independent in the `D`-dimensional screw space `ScrewSpace k`, then `m ≤ D = screwDim k`. This is
the upper half of the cycle hypothesis `3 ≤ |V| ≤ D`: a cycle of `m` panels and `m` hinges is
infinitesimally rigid exactly when its `m` supporting extensors are independent, which by the
dimension of `ScrewSpace k` forces `m ≤ D`. The general-position bound the general cycle
realization respects; immediate from `card_le_screwDim_of_linearIndependent`. The matching
*existence* of an independent family for a given cycle (`3 ≤ m ≤ D`) is the generic-panel
independence argument (Claim 6.4/6.9), the remaining red content of `lem:cycle-realization`. -/

/-- **The panel cycle realization** (`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4): a panel-hinge
framework on the cycle `Fin m` (`m ≥ 1`), whose `i`-th edge `e i` links bodies `i` and `i + 1`
(cyclically) and whose `m` panel support extensors `panelSupportExtensor (normal …) (normal …)`
are linearly independent in the screw space `ScrewSpace k`, has an infinitesimally rigid
body-hinge interpretation — `P.toBodyHinge.RankHypothesis 0`, the full target rank
`D(|V|−1) − 0` of the minimal `0`-dof case. The panel analogue of the two-body short-cycle base
`toBodyHinge_rankHypothesis_zero`, generalized to a cycle of any length `m`: lifted verbatim
through `toBodyHinge` from `BodyHingeFramework.rankHypothesis_zero_of_cycle`, whose proof
propagates `S u = S v` around the cycle. The matching dimension cap `m ≤ D` is
`card_le_screwDim_of_supportExtensor_linearIndependent`, so for `3 ≤ m ≤ D` the
genericity-supplied independent panel extensors (`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`)
realize the rigid cycle KT Lemma 5.4 asserts. -/

endpoints' panels, so all hinges incident to a body `v` lie in the single panel `panel(v)` — the
coplanarity constraint that distinguishes Katoh–Tanigawa's panel-hinge (molecular) model from the
free-hinge body-hinge model. This is the property Theorem 5.5's panel constructions establish; the
