# The algebraic induction: Theorem 5.5 base, Cases I & II (`sec:molecular-algebraic-induction`)

Phase 21, the fifth proof stratum of the molecular-conjecture program (Phases 17–26; see
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). Where the combinatorial induction (Phase 20,
`Molecular/Induction.lean`) reduced every minimal `0`-dof-graph to the two-vertex double
edge (Theorem 4.9, `Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction`), this file *realizes* that reduction at
the rigidity-matrix rank: Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 (*A proof of the molecular conjecture*,
Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, §5, §6.1–6.3) **Theorem 5.5** — every minimal `k`-dof-graph
`G` with `|V| ≥ 2` has a panel-hinge realization `(G,p)` with `rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − k` —
its base case, Case I (proper rigid subgraph), and Case II (`k > 0` splitting). The crux
Case III (`k = 0`, no proper rigid subgraph) is deferred to Phases 22–23.

## The panel layer (`def:panel-hinge-framework`)

Katoh–Tanigawa's *panel-hinge* framework is a **hinge-coplanar** body-hinge framework: at
each vertex all incident hinges lie in a common hyperplane (KT 2011 p.647). The conjecture's
content is that this coplanarity constraint can be met *without losing rigidity*. The
Phase-18 `BodyHingeFramework` carries free hinges with no coplanarity, so the
realization-existence nodes need a **panel layer** on top (`DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge =
hinge-coplanar body-hinge*). We take the panel-data form: a panel realization assigns each
body `v` a *hyperplane normal* `nᵥ ∈ ℝ^(k+2)`, and the hinge at an edge `e = uv` is the
codimension-2 intersection `panel(u) ∩ panel(v)` of the two panels. Its supporting
`k`-extensor — the screw-space element `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` the rigidity matrix
constrains — is the Grassmann–Cayley meet of the two panels, equivalently
`complementIso (nᵤ ∧ nᵥ)` (`panelSupportExtensor`): the join `nᵤ ∧ nᵥ` is the grade-2
extensor of the two normals (`normalsJoin`, in `⋀^2 ℝ^(k+2)`), and the complement iso
`complementIso : ⋀^2 V ≃ ⋀^(k+2−2) V = ⋀^k V` (Phase 21a, `Molecular/Meet.lean`) lands it in
`ScrewSpace k`. The only general-position condition — the two panels meet transversally — is
then exactly that the two normals are linearly independent
(`panelSupportExtensor_ne_zero_iff`), so coplanarity and transversality both live in the
extensor algebra and no affine-subspace-intersection plumbing is needed. This is the leaf the
panel layer rests on; the panel framework `PanelHingeFramework`, its body-hinge interpretation
`toBodyHinge`, and the coplanarity spec `IsHingeCoplanar` land on top in subsequent commits.

## The rank-induction nodes

This file lands the `sec:molecular-algebraic-induction` dep-graph in dependency order. The
regime-agnostic rank leaf nodes (retained verbatim under the panel layer):

* `RankHypothesis` (`def:rank-hypothesis`) — the realization hypothesis (6.1). Carried in
  the basis-free form of Phase 18 (`Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean`): the panel-hinge rigidity
  matrix `R(G,p)` is the constraint family cutting out the null space
  `Z(G,p) = F.infinitesimalMotions`, and `rank R(G,p) = D|V| − dim Z(G,p)`
  (`def:rigidity-matrix`'s codimension form, `finrank_screwAssignment`). The target rank
  `rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − k = D|V| − (D + k)` is therefore the null-space dimension
  `dim Z(G,p) = D + k`, the form carried here. (`D = screwDim k`.)
* `theorem_55_base` (`lem:theorem-55-base`) — the `|V| = 2`, `k = 0` base case: the
  two-vertex double edge with two non-parallel hinges (independent supporting extensors)
  realizes the full rank `D = D(2−1) − 0`. In the `V(G)`-relative motive (`def:rank-hypothesis`,
  the Phase-21b re-plan) the conclusion is `IsInfinitesimallyRigidOn {u, v}` — every infinitesimal
  motion is constant on the two bodies `V(G) = {u, v}` — exactly the parallel-hinges-full Lemma 5.3
  (`eq_of_hingeConstraint_two_parallel`, Phase 18 green) specialized to the two bodies. (The prior
  absolute form additionally assumed `α = {u, v}`, the unsatisfiable-for-subgraphs artefact.)

## The rank in basis-free form

Phase 18 carries `rank R(G,p)` as a codimension: the column space is the screw-assignment
space `α → ScrewSpace k` of dimension `D|V|` (`finrank_screwAssignment`), and the null space
is `Z(G,p) = F.infinitesimalMotions`, so `rank R(G,p) = D|V| − dim Z(G,p)`. Rather than carry
the `ℤ`-valued rank and re-derive the column count at each node, the realization hypothesis is
stated directly on the null-space dimension: `RankHypothesis F k` asserts
`dim Z(G,p) = D + k`, the rearrangement of `rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − k`. The two forms are
interchanged by `finrank_screwAssignment`; the null-space form is the one the rank lemmas of
Phase 18 (`finrank_pinnedMotions_add_screwDim`, `finrank_trivialMotions`) already speak.

/-! ## The panel support extensor (`def:panel-support-extensor`, panel-layer leaf)

A **panel** at a body is a hyperplane of `ℝ^(k+1)`, carried by its normal vector
`n ∈ ℝ^(k+2)` (homogenized). The hinge at an edge `e = uv` is the codimension-2 intersection
`panel(u) ∩ panel(v)` of the two panels; its supporting `k`-extensor — the element of the
screw space `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)` that the rigidity matrix constrains — is the
Grassmann–Cayley **meet** of the two panels. Concretely it is `complementIso (n_u ∧ n_v)`:
the join `n_u ∧ n_v` is the grade-2 extensor of the two normals (`normalsJoin`, landing in
`⋀^2 ℝ^(k+2)`), and the complement iso `complementIso : ⋀^2 V ≃ ⋀^(k+2−2) V = ⋀^k V`
(Phase 21a, `Molecular/Meet.lean`) carries it into `ScrewSpace k`.

This is the leaf the whole panel layer rests on: it produces the supporting extensor of a
panel hinge directly from the per-vertex normals, with the only general-position condition —
the two panels meeting transversally — being exactly the linear independence of the two
normals (`panelSupportExtensor_ne_zero_iff`). So coplanarity (both hinges at `v` lie in
`panel(v)` by construction) and transversality both live in the extensor algebra, and the
panel framework `PanelHingeFramework` (subsequent commit) carries only the per-vertex normals
with no affine-subspace-intersection plumbing. -/

/-- **The grade-2 join of two panel normals** (`def:panel-support-extensor`): the wedge
`n₁ ∧ n₂` of two normal vectors of `ℝ^(k+2)`, landing in the grade-2 piece
`⋀^2 ℝ^(k+2)`. The join of the two panels' poles, dual to the codimension-2 intersection of
the panels themselves; the `complementIso` of this is the panel hinge's supporting extensor
(`panelSupportExtensor`). -/

the grade-2 join `normalsJoin n₁ n₂` is the `2 × 2` minor
`n₁(i)·n₂(j) − n₁(j)·n₂(i)`, where `i < j` are the two ordered elements of `s`. This is the
exterior-power duality pairing `ιMultiDual` against the standard dual basis
(`exteriorPower.basis_repr_apply` + `ιMultiDual_apply_ιMulti`), whose value is the determinant of
the `2 × 2` matrix of the normals' coordinates at the columns picked out by `s`
(`Matrix.det_fin_two`). It is *bilinear* in the two normals — degree-2 in their entries — which is
the analytic fact the genericity device (`lem:genericity-device`) rests on: the panel-support
extensor `complementIso (normalsJoin n₁ n₂)` is a fixed linear image, so every rigidity-row
coordinate is a degree-2 polynomial in the panel normals, and a rank attained at one realization is
attained generically. -/

(Claim 6.4/6.9): the existence of an infinitesimally rigid panel-cycle realization
(`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4) needs `m ≤ D` panel hinges whose supporting extensors are
independent, and this lemma turns that screw-space-independence question into an independence
question on the grade-2 joins of the panel normals — a concrete exterior-power statement that a
basis choice on `⋀²` (the panel-normal analogue of a generic point, bottoming on the

/-- **The panel-support-extensor coordinate polynomial evaluates to the actual `⋀^k`-coordinate**
(B0, `lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`, sub-commit 2): the eval identity carrying
`panelSupportPoly`. Evaluating `panelSupportPoly u v t` at a panel-coordinate point
`q : α × Fin (k+2) → ℝ` gives the `t`-th coordinate (in the standard `⋀^k`-basis) of the panel
support extensor `panelSupportExtensor (q (u, ·)) (q (v, ·))`. The proof expands
`panelSupportExtensor = complementIso ∘ normalsJoin`, writes the grade-2 join in the `⋀²`-basis
(`Basis.sum_repr`), and pushes the fixed linear `complementIso` and the basis `repr` through the
sum (as the `ℝ`-valued composite `Finsupp.lapply t ∘ₗ repr ∘ₗ complementIso`, via `map_sum`),
reducing the per-`s` coordinate to `eval q (normalsJoinPoly u v s)` (`normalsJoinPoly_eval`). This
is the eval half of the `complementIso`-staging of B0: the panel rows' `ScrewSpace`-coordinates
are `eval`-of-a-fixed-degree-2-polynomial. -/

/-! ## The per-edge annihilator family (B0, `lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`, sub-commit 3)

The hinge-row block at an edge is the dual annihilator `(span {C})^⊥` of the supporting extensor
`C = panelSupportExtensor n_u n_v ∈ ScrewSpace k` (`def:hinge-row-block`). To feed it into the
genericity device the rows must be presented as a *spanning family* of functionals whose
coordinates are polynomials in the panel normals. The standard spanning family of `(span {C})^⊥`
is `{C_{t₁} e_{t₂}^{*} − C_{t₂} e_{t₁}^{*}}` over pairs of basis indices `(t₁, t₂)`, where `C_t` is
the `t`-th coordinate of `C` in the standard `⋀^k` basis and `e_t^{*}` the dual basis functional:
each member annihilates `C` (its value at `C` is `C_{t₁} C_{t₂} − C_{t₂} C_{t₁} = 0`), and together
they span the whole `(D−1)`-dimensional annihilator. Crucially each member is *linear in `C`*, so
substituting the degree-2 panel-coordinate polynomials `panelSupportPoly` for `C`'s coordinates
keeps the rigidity rows degree-2 in the panel normals — the device's polynomiality input. -/

/-- The **standard exterior-power basis of the screw space** `ScrewSpace k = ⋀^k ℝ^(k+2)`
(`def:rigidity-matrix`): the exterior power of the standard basis `Pi.basisFun ℝ (Fin (k+2))` of
`ℝ^(k+2)`, indexed by the `k`-element subsets `t ⊆ Fin (k+2)` (`Set.powersetCard (Fin (k+2)) k`).
Its coordinate functionals `screwBasis.repr (·) t` are the `⋀^k`-coordinates the panel-support
polynomial `panelSupportPoly` evaluates to (`panelSupportPoly_eval`); abbreviated here so the
annihilator family below reads cleanly. -/

`t`-th coordinate of `C` (`screwBasis k |>.repr C t`) and `e_t^{*} = screwBasis k |>.coord t` the
dual basis functional. It annihilates `C` (`annihRow_apply_self`) and the whole family spans the
dual annihilator `(span {C})^⊥` (`span_annihRow_eq_dualAnnihilator`); each functional is *linear in
`C`*, which is what keeps the panel-coordinatized rigidity rows degree-2. -/

/-- The annihilator functional vanishes at the screw vector it is built from (B0): `annihRow C t₁ t₂

/-- **The annihilator family spans the hinge-row block** (B0, `lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`,
the device-input span identity): for a nonzero screw vector `C`, the span of the per-pair
annihilator functionals `annihRow C t₁ t₂` is the dual annihilator `(span {C})^⊥` — exactly the
hinge-row block `r(p(e))` of an edge with supporting extensor `C` (`def:hinge-row-block`).

The containment `⊆` is `annihRow_apply_self` (each member annihilates `C`). For `⊇`, fix a
coordinate `t₀` with `C_{t₀} ≠ 0` (it exists since `C ≠ 0`). Any `f` annihilating `C` is the
explicit combination `f = ∑_t (f(b t) / C_{t₀}) • annihRow C t₀ t`: checking it on each basis
vector `b_s`, the `s ≠ t₀` coordinate is `f(b_s)` directly, and the `s = t₀` coordinate collapses
to `f(b_{t₀})` precisely because `∑_t C_t f(b_t) = f C = 0`. So `f`
lies in the span of the family. This is the spanning brick that turns the
panel-coordinatized `annihRow` family into a finite family whose span is the rigidity-row space —
the device's `hcoord` input through `infinitesimalMotions_eq_dualCoannihilator`. -/

explicit annihilator-row family `panelRow` equals the span of the (a-priori-infinite) rigidity-row
set `rigidityRows`. The `⊆` is by membership: each `annihRow C t₁ t₂` lies in the hinge-row block
`(span {C})^⊥` (`annihRow_apply_self`), so its `hingeRow` image is a rigidity row. The `⊇` uses the
spanning identity `span_annihRow_eq_dualAnnihilator` (the family spans the *whole* block for
`C ≠ 0`): any rigidity row `hingeRow u v r` with `r ∈ r(p(e))` has, by edge-uniqueness
(`IsLink.eq_and_eq_or_eq_and_eq`), endpoints `(u,v) = ends e` or its reverse; in either orientation
`hingeRow u v r` is a (signed) combination of the `panelRow` family, since `r` is in the span of

*actual* panel rows** (`lem:case-II-placement-new-rows`, the honesty-gate bridge to
`lem:realization-of-independent-rows`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.3, eq. (6.12)). The strengthening of
`exists_independent_panelRow_of_edge` (N7b-1) that the Case-II placement assembly (N7b) consumes.
Where N7b-1 produces a `D − 1` independent family of rows that are merely *members of* the per-edge
panel-row span, the device-closure glue `hasFullRankRealization_of_independent_panelRow` (N7a) needs
a `LinearIndependent` of a literal `panelRow ends`-subfamily indexed by a `Set` of panel-row
indices. This lemma bridges that gap: for a transversal hinge `e = uv` (distinct endpoints, nonzero
supporting extensor `he`), there is an *index subset* `s ⊆ {e} × ⋀^k-pairs` — every index using the
edge `e` — of size `Nat.card s = D − 1` whose actual `panelRow ends`-subfamily
`fun i : s ↦ F.panelRow ends i` is linearly independent.

The construction is the honest extraction: the per-edge panel-row family
`(t₁, t₂) ↦ F.panelRow ends (e, t₁, t₂)` spans a `(D − 1)`-dimensional space — its span is the
`hingeRow u v` image of the `(D − 1)`-dimensional hinge-row block `r(p(e))` (`span_panelRow_edge_eq`
+ `finrank_hingeRowBlock`, equal `finrank` through the injective dual map
`Submodule.equivMapOfInjective`). `Submodule.exists_fun_fin_finrank_span_eq` then extracts a
`Fin (D − 1)`-indexed *independent* subfamily of *actual* panel rows from that span's generators;
re-indexing each chosen row by its `⋀^k`-pair `idx i` (so `j i := (e, idx i)`, injective since the
panel rows are independent) packages them as the genuine `panelRow`-index subset `s := range j`.
This is the index-subfamily the genericity device varies over (`exists_good_realization_ofParam`'s
`hindep`), so it is the honest input N7a consumes — no functional-vs-`panelRow` laundering. -/

/-- **Theorem 5.5, base case (`|V| = 2`)** (`lem:theorem-55-base`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §5):
the two-vertex double edge realizes the target rank `D(|V(G)|−1) − k = D − 0 = D` of the minimal
`0`-dof case, in the `V(G)`-relative motive (`def:rank-hypothesis`, `IsInfinitesimallyRigidOn`).
Concretely, if a body-hinge framework `F` has two edges `e₁, e₂` joining two distinct bodies
`u v` whose supporting extensors `C(p(e₁)), C(p(e₂))` are linearly independent (the
non-parallel-hinges, *general-position* hypothesis), then `F` is infinitesimally rigid *on the
two bodies* `{u, v} = V(G)` — every infinitesimal motion is constant on `{u, v}`.

This is the parallel-hinges-full Lemma 5.3 (`eq_of_hingeConstraint_two_parallel`, Phase 18
green) specialized to the two bodies: the two `(D−1) × D` hinge-row blocks together have full
rank `D`, so the combined kernel on the relative screw is `{0}` and every infinitesimal motion
carries `S u = S v`, i.e. is constant on `{u, v}`. **`V(G)`-relative re-statement (Phase 21b):**
the prior version concluded the *absolute* `F.RankHypothesis 0` (`F.IsInfinitesimallyRigid`,
constancy on all of `α`) under the extra hypothesis `hcover : ∀ w, w = u ∨ w = v` ("`α = {u, v}`",
the absolute-motive artefact, unsatisfiable for the non-spanning inductive subgraphs); the
relative conclusion needs no condition on bodies outside `{u, v}`, so `hcover` is dropped. -/

/-! ## The `m`-body cycle base (`lem:cycle-realization`, KT Lemma 5.4)

The general (`m`-body) panel-cycle realization. A cycle of `m` bodies `0, 1, …, m−1` (carried as
`Fin m`) and `m` hinges, the `i`-th joining body `i` to body `i + 1` (cyclically, `Graph.IsLink
(e i) i (i + 1)`), is infinitesimally rigid exactly when its `m` supporting extensors are
linearly independent. The argument propagates `S u = S v` around the cycle: each hinge constraint
puts the relative screw `S i − S (i + 1)` in the one-dimensional span of `C(p(e i))`, and these
`m` differences telescope around the cycle to `∑ᵢ (S i − S (i+1)) = 0` (the rotation `i ↦ i + 1`
is a bijection of `Fin m`). Independence of the `m` extensors then forces every difference to
vanish (`eq_zero_of_mem_span_singleton_of_sum_eq_zero`, the `m`-edge generalization of the
parallel-hinges-full Lemma 5.3), so `S` is constant on the connected cycle — a trivial motion.
This is the `m`-body generalization of the two-body base case `theorem_55_base`; together with the
dimension bound `card_le_screwDim_of_linearIndependent` (`3 ≤ m ≤ D`) it is the cycle realization
of KT Lemma 5.4 (the genericity-supplied independent extensors come from
`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`). -/

edge `e i` links bodies `i` and `i + 1` (cyclically), if the `m` supporting extensors are linearly
independent then consecutive bodies carry the same screw, `S i = S (i + 1)`. Each hinge puts the
difference `S i − S (i + 1)` in `span C(p(e i))`, and the `m` differences telescope around the
cycle to `∑ᵢ (S i − S (i+1)) = 0` (the shift `i ↦ i + 1` is a bijection of `Fin m`,
`Equiv.addRight`); independence then forces each to vanish
(`eq_zero_of_mem_span_singleton_of_sum_eq_zero`). The `m`-edge generalization of the

the target rank at `k'` (`RankHypothesis F k'`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D + k'`) exactly when its

/-! ## The framework-construction op (`def:framework-with-graph`)

Both inductive cases of Theorem 5.5 build a realization of `G` from a realization of a
*different* graph: Case I from the contraction `G/E(H)`, Case II from the splitting-off
`G_v^{ab}`. The shared, citation-free primitive both need is the ability to keep a hinge
assignment fixed while changing the underlying multigraph. We package this as `withGraph`:
the framework on a new graph `G'` carrying the same hinge map (hence the same supporting
extensors and hinge-row blocks).

The one fact this phase needs from it is the *graph-monotonicity* of the motion space: adding
edges (passing to a supergraph) can only shrink the null space `Z(G,p)`, since each new link
imposes another hinge constraint. Dually, deleting edges — the direction Cases I/II travel,
toward the smaller inductive graph — can only enlarge it. This is the combinatorial companion
to the span-monotonicity Lemma 5.2 (`infinitesimalMotions_mono_of_span_le`, fixed graph,
refining spans); together they bound how `rank R(G,p)` moves under the two ways a realization's
data can change. The base identity `withGraph_supportExtensor` (the hinge data, hence every
extensor, is untouched) is what lets the two compose. -/

/-- **The framework on a new graph** (`def:framework-with-graph`): replace the underlying
multigraph of `F` by `G'`, keeping the hinge assignment — hence every supporting extensor
`C(p(e))`, hinge-row block `r(p(e))`, and per-edge constraint. This is the carrier for the
inductive constructions of Cases I and II, which realize a *different* graph (the contraction
`G/E(H)`, the splitting-off `G_v^{ab}`) on the same hinge data of the parent framework. -/

/-- **Graph monotonicity of the motion space** (`lem:motions-mono-of-graph-le`): a supergraph
imposes more hinge constraints, so its null space is contained in the subgraph's. If
`F'.graph ≤ F.graph` and `F'` carries the same hinge data as `F` (the supporting extensors
agree), then every infinitesimal motion of `F` is one of `F'`:
`F.infinitesimalMotions ≤ F'.infinitesimalMotions`. A motion of `F` meets the constraint at
every link of `F.graph`; each link of the smaller `F'.graph` is one of `F.graph`
(`Graph.IsLink.mono`), and the matching extensors carry the same constraint, so it meets every
constraint of `F'`.

The phase reaches this through `withGraph`: `F.infinitesimalMotions ≤ (F.withGraph G').
infinitesimalMotions` whenever `G' ≤ F.graph` (`infinitesimalMotions_le_withGraph_of_le`), the
"deleting edges enlarges the null space" half that Cases I/II use to pass to the smaller
inductive graph. -/

enter the constraint family, so an extensor change at a non-linking edge — the situation Case II's
`withNormal` creates when the re-inserted body `v` carries no incident edges yet — leaves the
motions untouched. The two inclusions are `infinitesimalMotions_mono_of_graph_le` (with `≤ = rfl`)

parent graph `G` toward the smaller inductive graph (the contraction `G/E(H)` or splitting-off
`G_v^{ab}`), where the realization count is supplied by the induction hypothesis. The supporting
extensors are untouched (`withGraph_supportExtensor`), so this is
`infinitesimalMotions_mono_of_graph_le` specialized to the `withGraph` carrier. -/

/-! ## Block-pinning a rigid subgraph (`def:pinned-motions-on`, Case I infra)

Case I of Theorem 5.5 contracts a *proper rigid subgraph* `H`: every body of `V(H)` collapses
to a single body of the contraction `G/E(H)`. The framework-side carrier of that move is
**block-pinning** — fixing the screws of *all* bodies of `V(H)` to zero, the set-level analogue
of `pinnedMotions v`. We package it as `pinnedMotionsOn s`, the infinitesimal motions vanishing
on every body of `s`; pinning a single body is the special case `s = {v}`
(`pinnedMotionsOn_singleton`), and the block pin is the infimum of the single-body pins over
`s` (`pinnedMotionsOn_eq_iInf`). This is the framework primitive Case I's block-triangular
gluing runs on; its `+D·|V(H)|`-style rank accounting (the generalization of the pin-a-body
identity `finrank_pinnedMotions_add_screwDim`) lands with the contraction realization once the
rigid block is placed. -/

/-- **Block-pinning at a set of bodies** (`def:pinned-motions-on`): the infinitesimal motions
`S` vanishing on *every* body of `s ⊆ α`, `∀ v ∈ s, S v = 0`. Fixing a whole block of bodies to
the zero screw is the algebraic effect of contracting them to one pinned body — the move Case I
makes on a rigid subgraph `H` (pin all of `V(H)`). Generalizes the single-body pin
`pinnedMotions v` (`pinnedMotionsOn_singleton`); carried as the submodule of
`infinitesimalMotions` cut out by the conjunction of vanishing conditions. -/

`lem:rank-delete-vertex`): pinning a whole block in particular pins one of its bodies `v ∈ s`
(`pinnedMotionsOn_le_pinnedMotions`), so the block intersection sits inside the single-body one,
which is already `⊥`. It is the disjointness half of Case I's block-triangular rank

(`finrank_trivialMotions`) and the block-pinned motions are disjoint
(`trivialMotions_inf_pinnedMotionsOn_eq_bot`) submodules of `Z(G,p)` (the block pin lies in
`infinitesimalMotions` by construction), so their dimensions add to at most `finrank Z(G,p)`.
This is the block analogue of the single-body equality `finrank_pinnedMotions_add_screwDim`
(Phase 18, `lem:rank-delete-vertex`) in inequality form: a single body pin is an exact `+D`
direct-sum split, whereas a block pin of a *rigid* `H` collapses `V(H)` to one effective body
and the residual `D(|V(H)|-1)` constraints make the bound an inequality (the contraction's
rank, supplied by the induction hypothesis, recovers the exact count). It is the lower-bound

/-- **Pinning the whole vertex set leaves only the free isolated bodies** (`def:pinned-motions-on`,
the relative-split core of `lem:relative-screw-split`, N1; Phase 21b). The block pin on the *entire*
vertex set `V(G)` is the submodule of all screw assignments vanishing on `V(G)`: a body in
`α ∖ V(G)` is incident to no edge of `G`, so it carries no hinge constraint, and an assignment
vanishing on `V(G)` automatically satisfies every constraint `S u − S v = 0 ∈ span C(p(e))` (both
endpoints `u v ∈ V(G)`). Thus the `IsInfinitesimalMotion` half of `pinnedMotionsOn V(G)` is free,
and the block pin reduces to the kernel of the projection onto the `V(G)` coordinates,
`⨅ i ∈ V(G), ker (proj i)`. This identifies the residual freedom after pinning the whole graph

/-- **The relative split** (`lem:relative-screw-split`, N1; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §5–6, Phase 21b).
The dimension of the block pin on the entire vertex set `V(G)` is `D` times the number of bodies
*outside* `V(G)`: `finrank (pinnedMotionsOn V(G)) = D · |α ∖ V(G)|`. These are exactly the free
isolated bodies — each contributes its full `D = screwDim k` screw freedoms, none of which any
hinge constraint touches. Combined with the block-pin lower bound
`screwDim_add_finrank_pinnedMotionsOn_le`, this is the bridge that strips the ambient
`D(|α| − |V(G)|)` free dimensions out of the device's *absolute* codimension count
(`#s + dim Z ≤ D|α|`), leaving the `V(G)`-relative count `#s + dim Z_{V(G)} ≤ D(|V(G)| − 1)` the
producers consume (`lem:isInfRigidOn-of-relative-count`, N3). The proof identifies
`pinnedMotionsOn V(G)` with `⨅ i ∈ V(G), ker (proj i)`
(`pinnedMotionsOn_vertexSet_eq_iInf_ker_proj`), then transports the dimension across mathlib's

/-- **A rigid framework, pinned at any nonempty block, has no residual motion**
(`lem:case-I`, the block-pin ↔ contraction-realization bridge, dimension form; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
§6.2/6.5). If the framework `F` is infinitesimally rigid (`IsInfinitesimallyRigid` — every
infinitesimal motion is trivial, i.e. `F` realizes its full rank `RankHypothesis 0`) then block-
pinning any *nonempty* body set `s` leaves nothing, `pinnedMotionsOn s = ⊥`. A block-pinned motion
`S` is an infinitesimal motion, so rigidity makes it a *trivial* (constant) motion; vanishing at
even one body `v ∈ s` then forces the constant to be `0`, so `S` is identically `0`.

This is the geometric heart of Case I in dimension form: a full-rank realization of the parent
graph `G` is rigid, hence pinning the rigid block `H` on `s = V(H)` carries no residual freedom —
the framework-side statement that the contraction `G/E(H)`, realized at its own full rank, makes
the block pin vanish. It feeds the block-pin `finrank` form

contraction-realization bridge, *converse* / rigidity-producing direction; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
§6.2/6.5). This is the framework-side core of Case I's block-triangular glue, the converse of
`pinnedMotionsOn_eq_bot_of_isInfinitesimallyRigid`: from the *two* block hypotheses Case I supplies
— `hblock`, every infinitesimal motion is *constant on the block* `s` (the rigid subgraph `H`,
placed rigidly, pins every motion to agree with a trivial motion across `V(H)`), and `hpin`, the
residual block pin vanishes `pinnedMotionsOn s = ⊥` (the contraction `G/E(H)`, realized at *its*
inductive full rank, leaves no freedom once the block is pinned) — the framework `F` is
infinitesimally rigid.

The algebra is the block-triangular split made one line: given a motion `S` and a body `v ∈ s`,
the constant assignment `T = fun _ => S v` is a trivial motion (hence a motion,
`isInfinitesimalMotion_of_isTrivialMotion`); their difference `S - T` is a motion that *vanishes on
every body of `s`* (on `s`, `hblock` makes `S` the constant `S v`, which `T` cancels), so
`S - T ∈ pinnedMotionsOn s = ⊥` by `hpin`, forcing `S = T`, a trivial motion. This is the
rigidity-producing brick the genuinely-geometric Case-I assembly (KT §6.2/6.5) feeds: the rigid
block placement supplies `hblock` and the contraction realization supplies `hpin`, and this lemma
turns the pair into rigidity of the glued framework. It is a genuine, reusable brick under the
`V(G)`-relative realization motive (`def:rank-hypothesis`); the prior absolute-motive Case-I

/-- **Case I, relativized rigidity bridge** (`lem:case-I`, the `V(G)`-relative rank-side
restatement; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.2/6.3/6.5). The `α`-independent form of the Case-I accounting:
given that every infinitesimal motion is constant on the rigid block `s` (`hblock` — supplied by
the rigidly-placed subgraph `H`, with `s = V(H)`), the framework is infinitesimally rigid on the
larger body set `t` (`s ⊆ t`, the relative motive `IsInfinitesimallyRigidOn t` at `t = V(G)`)
**iff** the block pin on `s` sits inside the block pin on `t` — i.e. every motion that vanishes on
the block already vanishes on all of `t`.

This re-states the absolute nullity bridge
(`pinnedMotionsOn_eq_bot_of_isInfinitesimallyRigid` /
`isInfinitesimallyRigid_of_block_of_pinnedMotionsOn_eq_bot`) `V(G)`-relative: both lemmas
concluded the *absolute* `IsInfinitesimallyRigid` (constancy on all of `α`) from
`pinnedMotionsOn s = ⊥`, which is unsatisfiable for a non-spanning subgraph (a free body in
`α ∖ V(G)` keeps the block pin from being `⊥`). The relative form references only `s, t ⊆ V(G)`
and so composes through the vertex-reducing induction. Since `s ⊆ t` already gives
`pinnedMotionsOn t ≤ pinnedMotionsOn s` (`pinnedMotionsOn_mono`), the inclusion is equivalently the
equality `pinnedMotionsOn s = pinnedMotionsOn t`: the rigid block carries no residual freedom
beyond what `t` pins.

The forward direction: a motion in `pinnedMotionsOn s` is constant on `t` (rigidity) and vanishes
at the witness `v ∈ s`, so it vanishes on `t`. The converse: subtracting the constant trivial
motion `T = S v` lands `S − T` in `pinnedMotionsOn s` (it vanishes on `s` by `hblock`), hence in
`pinnedMotionsOn t`, so `S` agrees with the constant `S v` across `t`. This is the rank-side leg
the Case-I producer (`lem:case-I-realization`) consumes to convert the block-triangular splice

/-- **Relative full count ⇒ the `V(G)`-relative motive** (`lem:isInfRigidOn-of-relative-count`,
N3; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §5–6, Phase 21b). The adapter that turns the genericity device's
*absolute* codimension count into the `V(G)`-relative motive. The device produces a realization
whose null space attains the relative full count, which after the relative split
(`lem:relative-screw-split`, N1, `finrank_pinnedMotionsOn_vertexSet`) reads
`dim Z(G,p) ≤ D·(|α ∖ V(G)| + 1)` --- the ambient free dimensions `D·|α ∖ V(G)|` plus the
`D` trivial-motion dimensions, with *no* residual relative corank. From this single inequality
the framework is infinitesimally rigid on `V(G)`.

The proof picks any body `v₀ ∈ V(G)` and reads rigidity-on-`V(G)` off the relativized Case-I
bridge `isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_iff_pinnedMotionsOn_le` at the trivially-rigid singleton block
`{v₀}`: it reduces to `pinnedMotionsOn {v₀} ≤ pinnedMotionsOn V(G)`. The reverse containment is
automatic (`pinnedMotionsOn_mono`, `{v₀} ⊆ V(G)`), so it suffices to match dimensions. The single-
body pin has `finrank (pinnedMotions v₀) = dim Z − D` (`finrank_pinnedMotions_add_screwDim`), which
the hypothesis caps at `D·|α ∖ V(G)|`; the block pin on `V(G)` has exactly that dimension by N1
(`finrank_pinnedMotionsOn_vertexSet`). Equal dimensions on a containment force equality, giving the
needed inclusion. -/

(6.6)). The genuine geometric content of Case I, `V(G)`-relative: from the two inductive
sub-realizations transported onto a *single* parent placement `F` on `G`, the parent realizes the
target rank on `V(G)`. Let `H` (on `sH = V(H)`) be the proper rigid subgraph and `G/E(H)` (on
`sc = V(G/E(H))`) the contraction — both subgraphs of `F.graph = G` via `withGraph`, sharing the
contracted body `c ∈ sH ∩ sc` and covering `V(G) ⊆ sH ∪ sc`. If `F` realizes the rigid block
(`hblock`, `(F.withGraph H)` rigid on `sH`) and the contraction
(`hcontract`, `(F.withGraph (G/E(H)))` rigid on `sc`) — each its own inductive `RankHypothesis`,
transported to the common placement `F` —
then `F` is infinitesimally rigid on `V(G)`, i.e. `R(G,p)` has `D(|V(G)|−1)` independent rows.

This is the block-triangular splice of KT~(6.3): each leg transports to the parent by the
"re-adding edges only shrinks motions" monotonicity (`isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_of_withGraph_of_le`,
since `H, G/E(H) ≤ G`), and the two relatively-rigid pieces glue along the shared contracted body
to rigidity on their union (`isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_union_of_inter`), restricted to `V(G)` by
`IsInfinitesimallyRigidOn.mono`. It is **genericity-free**: the device (`lem:genericity-device`)
enters only at the producer `lem:case-I-realization`, where the two legs must be realized at one
*generic* placement (the witness-transfer step — the intersection of the two legs' Zariski-open
rigid loci). The hypotheses here are the *satisfiable* inductive facts (relative rigidity of each
piece on a common `F`), not the parent rank they conclude — so the seed is honest, not a producer
that smuggles its deliverable. -/

restatement; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.3 Lemmas 6.7/6.8). The `α`-independent form of the Case-II
accounting: re-inserting a single body `v` to the splitting-off vertex set `t` (so
`V(G) = insert v t`), the framework is infinitesimally rigid on `V(G)`
(`IsInfinitesimallyRigidOn (insert v t)`, the relative motive at the parent) **iff** it is
infinitesimally rigid on the splitting-off body set `t` (the inductive realization of `G_v^{ab}`)
*and* every infinitesimal motion pins `v`'s screw to the rest of `V(G)`, `S v = S w` for `w ∈ t`.

This is the rank-side `+(D−1)` 1-extension count read off the relative motive: the inductive
realization handles `t`, and the two new `v`-incident hinges contribute exactly the constraint that
`v` move with the body it joins. The `S v = S w` condition is the honest geometric content of
Claim 6.9's general position (the span-membership `S a ∈ span C(e_a)`, `S b ∈ span C(e_b)` the
genericity device supplies); the existing nullity-side rank-lift
(`rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions`, the pin-a-body `+D` accounting) is its `α`-dependent
sibling, retained for the deficiency/Prop 1.1 path. The forward direction restricts rigidity to the
subset `t` (`IsInfinitesimallyRigidOn.mono`) and to the `v`-to-`t` pairs; the converse case-splits a
pair in `insert v t` on whether each endpoint is `v`. This is the leg the Case-II producer

§6.2/6.3/6.5 Lemmas 6.2, 6.3, 6.5; GREEN-modulo the Phase-21b genericity device). Let `F` be a
body-hinge framework on the parent graph `G = F.graph` carrying a proper rigid subgraph `H` on the
(nonempty) body set `s = V(H)`. Contracting `H` to a single pinned body is the block pin
`pinnedMotionsOn s`, and Case I builds the realization of `G` from a realization of the contraction
`G/E(H)` (a smaller minimal `k`-dof-graph, `lem:contraction-minimality`, green) glued
block-triangularly with the pinned rigid block. Then `F` realizes the target rank at `k'`
(`RankHypothesis k'`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D + k'`) **iff** the block pin has dimension `k'` — the
contraction's inductive rank.

This is the genericity-free assembly of Case I, the parallel of the Case II 1-extension
`rankHypothesis_withNormal_withGraph_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions`. The genericity-free skeleton is
the block-pin lower bound `screwDim_add_finrank_pinnedMotionsOn_le` (the `D`-dimensional trivial
motions and the block pin are disjoint inside `Z(G,p)`, so `D + dim Z_s ≤ dim Z`, always). The
**one** input from the Phase-21b device is `hglue`: the block-triangular gluing closes that slack
to an equality, `dim Z(G,p) ≤ D + dim Z_s(G,p)` (the reverse inequality — KT's Claim 6.4 that the
combined rigidity matrix attains the sum of the two block ranks, the generic-position step lifting
a single good realization to a generic one). That is *not* automatic: it holds only at the generic
point the Claim 6.4 rank/dimension count selects. Taking `hglue` as an explicit hypothesis makes
`lem:case-I` GREEN-modulo-21b: combined with the green lower bound it pins
`dim Z(G,p) = D + dim Z_s`, so the realization count is exactly the contraction's block-pinned
dimension. -/

/-- **Deleting edges enlarges the block-pinned motion space** (`def:pinned-motions-on`, Case I
infra): replacing `F.graph` by any subgraph `G' ≤ F.graph` (keeping the hinge data via
`withGraph`) can only grow the block pin — `F.pinnedMotionsOn s ≤ (F.withGraph G').pinnedMotionsOn
s`. The block pin is the motion space cut by the (graph-independent) vanishing conditions
`∀ v ∈ s, S v = 0`, so the inclusion is the motion-space monotonicity
`infinitesimalMotions_le_withGraph_of_le` on the first conjunct, with the vanishing conditions
carried unchanged. This is the block-pin analogue of `infinitesimalMotions_le_withGraph_of_le`
and the direction Case I's block-triangular gluing travels: placing the contraction realization
on the smaller inductive graph `G/E(H)` and re-adding the edges `E(H)` only grows the block-pinned
rank, the slack in `screwDim_add_finrank_pinnedMotionsOn_le` being filled by the contraction. -/

/-- **Deleting block-internal edges does not change the block pin** (`def:pinned-motions-on`,
Case I infra; the contraction reduction of the block pin). If a subgraph `G' ≤ F.graph` drops only
edges *internal to the pinned block* `s` — every link `e = uv` of the parent `F.graph` that `G'`
omits has *both* endpoints `u, v ∈ s` — then the block pin is unchanged:
`(F.withGraph G').pinnedMotionsOn s = F.pinnedMotionsOn s`.

This is the framework primitive behind the Case-I contraction reduction (Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
§6.2/6.5): writing the contraction `G/E(H)` as the parent with the block edges `E(H) ⊆ V(H)×V(H)`
deleted (all internal to the pinned block `s = V(H)`), pinning `s` makes those deleted hinge
constraints *vacuous* — at an internal edge `e = uv` both `S u = S v = 0`, so `S u − S v = 0` lies
in any extensor span automatically. Hence a `G'`-motion pinned on `s` is already a parent motion,
and the two block pins coincide. The `≤` direction is the unconditional graph-monotone
`pinnedMotionsOn_le_withGraph_of_le`; the reverse uses the block-internality of the dropped edges.

It lets the residual block-pin obligation `hpin` (`pinnedMotionsOn s = ⊥` for the parent) be read
off the *contraction* `G/E(H)` directly: `F.pinnedMotionsOn s = (F.withGraph (G/E(H))).

*equal* those on the smaller graph `G'` — `F.pinnedMotions v = (F.withGraph G').pinnedMotions v` —

each *re-added* edge (every link `e u w` of `F.graph` that is not a link of `G'`), the hypothesis
`hnew`. The `≤` direction is the unconditional `pinnedMotions_le_withGraph` (re-adding edges only
shrinks the pin); the reverse `≥` is exactly `hnew` — a base-pinned motion `S` (with `S v = 0`) is
parent-pinned iff it meets the two new `v`-incident constraints `S a ∈ span C(e_a)`,
`S b ∈ span C(e_b)`. That is the honest content of Claim 6.9's general position: the splitting-off
`G_v^{ab} = G'` carries `v`'s two new hinge edges `e_a, e_b` (the only links of `F.graph` outside

downstream by placing the two new supporting extensors in general position
(`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`). The constraints of edges already in `G'` are met

/-- **Case II's `hnew` reduces to a single span-membership per re-added edge** (`lem:case-II`,
the genericity-gated equality). In the splitting-off 1-extension the only links of `F.graph`
outside the smaller graph `G'` are the two new hinge edges *incident to* `v` (KT 2011 §6.3:
splitting-off at a degree-2 vertex `v` re-adds exactly the edges `v–a` and `v–b`). For a
base-`v`-pinned motion `S` (so `S v = 0`), the hinge constraint of such a `v`-incident edge
`e` linking `v w` is `S v − S w = −S w ∈ span C(e)`, i.e. just `S w ∈ span C(e)` — the
difference collapses because the pinned body contributes zero. So the full `hnew` hypothesis
of `pinnedMotions_withGraph_eq` follows from: (a) every out-of-`G'` link of `F.graph` is
incident to `v` (`hinc`), and (b) for each such link `e v w` the non-`v` endpoint `w` already
lands in the new edge's hinge span (`hspan`). This is the brick that turns the abstract
`hnew` into the concrete two-edge condition the genericity device (Claim 6.9, supplied by
`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`) discharges: it isolates the *single* span-membership
per new edge that general position must achieve, stripping the relative-screw difference. The
`hingeConstraint_comm` orients each link so `v` sits on the left, then `S v = 0` and

/-! ## The panel-hinge framework (`def:panel-hinge-framework`)

Katoh–Tanigawa's *panel-hinge* framework is a **hinge-coplanar** body-hinge framework: at each
body `v`, all incident hinges lie in a common hyperplane `panel(v)` (KT 2011 p.647). We carry
the panel-data form (`DESIGN.md` *Panel-hinge = hinge-coplanar body-hinge*): a
`PanelHingeFramework` assigns each body `v` a hyperplane *normal* `normal v ∈ ℝ^(k+2)`, and the
hinge at an edge `e = uv` is the codimension-2 intersection `panel(u) ∩ panel(v)`, whose
supporting `k`-extensor is the Grassmann–Cayley meet `panelSupportExtensor (normal u) (normal v)`
(`def:panel-support-extensor`). Because each edge's two endpoints are not a function of the edge
alone in mathlib's relational `Graph`, the structure also carries an explicit endpoint selector
`ends : β → α × α`; the supporting extensor of `e` is the meet of the two normals at `ends e`.

The body-hinge interpretation `toBodyHinge` (`def:panel-hinge-framework`) feeds this support
extensor into the Phase-18 rigidity-matrix rank theory verbatim: it is the `BodyHingeFramework`
with `supportExtensor e = panelSupportExtensor (normal u) (normal v)` at `(u,v) = ends e`. Every
incident hinge at `v` is then a meet whose join factor includes `normal v`, so it lies in the
panel `panel(v) = {normal v}^⊥` by construction — coplanarity is structural, with no
affine-intersection plumbing. The coplanarity *spec* `IsHingeCoplanar` on a bare
`BodyHingeFramework` is exactly "arises as a `toBodyHinge`", automatic for the panel
constructions of Theorem 5.5 (`isHingeCoplanar_toBodyHinge`). -/

/-- A **`d = k+1`-dimensional panel-hinge framework** (`def:panel-hinge-framework`;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011): a multigraph `G : Graph α β` together with a per-body *panel normal*
`normal v ∈ ℝ^(k+2)` (the pole of body `v`'s hyperplane `panel(v)`) and an endpoint selector
`ends : β → α × α` for the edges. The hinge at edge `e` is the codimension-2 intersection of the
two panels at `ends e`; its supporting `k`-extensor is the meet `panelSupportExtensor` of the two
normals (`def:panel-support-extensor`). Unlike `BodyHingeFramework`'s free hinges, every hinge
incident to `v` lies in the single panel `panel(v)` — the hinge-coplanarity that *defines* the
panel-hinge (molecular) model. -/

Katoh–Tanigawa's Lemma 5.4 (the geometric content of Crapo–Whiteley 1982 Prop 3.4 / Whiteley
1999 Kluwer Prop 3): a cycle graph `G = (V, E)` with `3 ≤ |V| ≤ D` has an infinitesimally rigid,
nonparallel *panel*-hinge realization `(G, p)` — equivalently a realization at the full rank
`D(|V|−1)`, the target rank of the minimal `0`-dof case (`RankHypothesis 0`). Geometrically a
cycle of `m` panels and `m` hinges is rigid exactly when its `m` supporting `k`-extensors are
linearly independent in the `D`-dimensional screw space `ScrewSpace k`, which a generic choice of
the `m` panel normals achieves whenever `m ≤ D` (the dimension bound `3 ≤ |V| ≤ D`).

This file lands the **short-cycle base** of that statement: the panel analogue of the two-body
base case `theorem_55_base`, lifted through `toBodyHinge`. A `PanelHingeFramework` on a two-body
cover whose two edges' panel support extensors are independent has an infinitesimally rigid
body-hinge interpretation, i.e. realizes `RankHypothesis 0` at the full rank `D`. The general
cycle (`|V| ≥ 3`) and the generic-panel independence argument that supplies the linearly
independent supporting extensors (bottoming on the extensor-independence Lemma 2.1, Phase 17)
remain red — that is the genericity device (Claim 6.4/6.9) shared with Cases I/II. -/

/-! ## Setting the panel normal at one body (`def:panel-hinge-framework`, Case II infra)

Case II of Theorem 5.5 re-inserts a reducible degree-2 body `v` into the splitting-off
`G_v^{ab}`: it builds a panel realization of the larger graph `G` from one of `G_v^{ab}` by
*choosing a panel normal for `v`* (the two new hinges at `v` are the meets of `panel(v)` with
the panels of its two neighbours `a, b`). The framework-side carrier of that move is
`withNormal v n`: override the panel normal at the single body `v` by `n`, leaving the
multigraph, the endpoint selector, and every other body's normal fixed. This is the per-body
analogue of `withGraph` (which swaps the whole graph) and the panel-data primitive the
1-extension is assembled from; combined with `withGraph` (to enlarge the graph by `v`'s two new
edges) it produces the extended panel realization whose rank Case II accounts for via the `+D`
rank-lift `rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions`. -/

Lemma 6.8): the panel-hinge $1$-extension realizes the target rank at `k'` exactly when the
splitting-off carries pinned-motion dimension `k'`. Building the extended panel framework on `G`
by choosing a panel normal `n` for the re-inserted body `v` (`withNormal v n`), the extended
framework realizes the rank hypothesis at `k'` (`RankHypothesis k'`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D + k'`)
exactly when the *original* framework's body-`v`-pinned motions have dimension `k'` —
`(P.withNormal v n).toBodyHinge.RankHypothesis k' ↔ finrank (P.toBodyHinge.pinnedMotions v) = k'` —
provided `v` is yet unhinged in `P.graph` (no linking edge has `v` among its endpoints, `hv`). The
$+D$ rank-lift `rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions` re-inserts `v`'s `D` screw freedoms, and
the choice of `v`'s panel does not disturb the inductive null space when `v` is unhinged

its inductive count — measured by its `v`-pinned dimension `k'` — lifts to a realization of `G` at

Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.3 Lemmas 6.7/6.8; GREEN-modulo the Phase-21b genericity device). Let `P`
be a panel-hinge framework on the splitting-off graph `G_v^{ab} = P.graph`, in which the
re-inserted body `v` is *yet unhinged* (no linking edge has `v` among its endpoints, `hv`), and
let `G` be the parent graph with `P.graph ≤ G`. Choosing a panel normal `n` for `v` and enlarging
the graph to `G` produces the extended panel framework `(P.withNormal v n).withGraph G` — the
panel-hinge analogue of Whiteley's bar-joint `1`-extension. Then the extended framework realizes
the target rank at `k'` (`RankHypothesis k'`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D + k'`) **iff** the original
splitting-off framework `P` carries body-`v`-pinned-motion dimension `k'` — so the inductive
realization of `G_v^{ab}` lifts to `G`, the two new hinge-row blocks accounting for the `+D`
(`rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions`, the pin-a-body Lemma 5.1).

This is the genericity-free assembly of Case II: it wires the vertex-level splitting-off
op `G_v^{ab}` (green in Phase 20) into the panel `withNormal`/`withGraph` carriers through the
rank-lift accounting (`rankHypothesis_withNormal_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions` via the unhinged-`v`
invariance `toBodyHinge_withNormal_pinnedMotions_eq`) and the genericity-gated tightness
(`toBodyHinge_pinnedMotions_withGraph_eq`, the `≥` half). The two graph-side hypotheses are
genericity-free: `hv` (`v` unhinged in `G_v^{ab}`, true before its two new edges are added) and
`hinc` (every link of `G` lost on passing to `G_v^{ab}` is `v`-incident — the
`isLink_incident_of_not_removeVertex` brick at the common lower bound, here `G_v^{ab}` itself). The
**one** input from the Phase-21b device is `hspan`: each base-`v`-pinned motion lands in the two
new edges' panel-support spans (`S a ∈ span C(e_a)`, `S b ∈ span C(e_b)`). That is *false
pointwise* — it holds only for the general-position normals the genericity rank/dimension count
(Claim 6.9) selects, supplied by `exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`. Taking `hspan` as an
explicit hypothesis makes `lem:case-II` GREEN-modulo-21b. The `S w ∈ span C(e)` form (rather than
the full hinge constraint `S v − S w ∈ span C(e)`) is the collapse a base-pinned `S v = 0` already

/-! ## Theorem 5.5: realization at the target rank (`thm:theorem-55`)

The capstone of Phase 21. Where the combinatorial induction (Phase 20,
`Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction`, KT Theorem 4.9) reduced every minimal `0`-dof-graph to the
two-vertex double edge, this theorem *realizes* that reduction at the rigidity-matrix rank:
every minimal `0`-dof-graph `G` with `|V| ≥ 2` carries a panel-hinge realization of the full
rank `D(|V|−1)`, i.e. an infinitesimally rigid panel-hinge framework `(G,p)` (Katoh–Tanigawa
2011 §5, Theorem 5.5, at `k = 0`).

The proof is the genericity-free assembly over the Phase-20 reduction dichotomy: it runs the
well-founded induction principle `Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction` against the *realization*
motive `HasFullRankRealization` (`∃ Q, Q.graph = G ∧ Q.toBodyHinge.IsInfinitesimallyRigidOn V(G)`,
the `V(G)`-relative rank form `rank R(G,p) = D(|V(G)|−1)`; the absolute null-space form is
unsatisfiable for the non-spanning inductive subgraphs — Phase-21b re-plan, `def:rank-hypothesis`),
discharging its three premises with the base case (`lem:theorem-55-base`), the splitting-off
1-extension (Case II, `lem:case-II`), and the rigid-subgraph contraction (Case I, `lem:case-I`).
The two inductive cases are GREEN-modulo-21b — each lands the iff-realization `RankHypothesis ↔
pinned dimension` taking its genericity input (the general-position panel normals of Claim
6.9/6.4) as an explicit hypothesis — so the induction *itself* is genericity-free and inherits
the Phase-21b citation transitively through the cases. The per-case realization steps are taken
here as hypotheses (`hbase`/`hsplit`/`hcontract`), the shape the consumer assembles from the
panel capstones `toBodyHinge_rankHypothesis_zero_cycle` (base), the Case II
`rankHypothesis_withNormal_withGraph_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions`, and the Case I
`toBodyHinge_rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotionsOn` once the genericity device supplies the
general-position normals; Case III (`k = 0`, no proper rigid subgraph) closes the dichotomy and
is deferred to Phases 22–23. -/

(`thm:theorem-55`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §5, Theorem 5.5, at `k = 0`). For the molecular regime
`D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 3` (so `n ≥ 2`) and a freshness supply of edge labels (`hfresh`), every
minimal `0`-dof-graph `G` with `2 ≤ |V(G)|` admits a panel-hinge framework `Q` on `G` whose
body-hinge interpretation is infinitesimally rigid
(`PanelHingeFramework.HasFullRankRealization k G` — full rank `D(|V|−1)`).

This is the genericity-free assembly over Phase 20's reduction dichotomy
(`Graph.minimal_kdof_reduction`): the realization motive `HasFullRankRealization k` is closed
under the two-vertex base case (`hbase`, `lem:theorem-55-base`), splitting off a reducible
degree-2 vertex (`hsplit`, Case II `lem:case-II`), and contracting a proper rigid subgraph
(`hcontract`, Case I `lem:case-I`). Each inductive case is GREEN-modulo-21b — its iff-realization
(`PanelHingeFramework.rankHypothesis_withNormal_withGraph_iff_finrank_pinnedMotions` for Case II,
`PanelHingeFramework.toBodyHinge_rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_pinnedMotionsOn` for Case I) takes the
general-position panel normals of Claim 6.9/6.4 (the Phase-21b genericity device) as an explicit
hypothesis — so the three realization steps are taken here as hypotheses and the induction itself
is genericity-free, inheriting the Phase-21b citation transitively. Case III (`k = 0`, no proper
rigid subgraph) closes the dichotomy combinatorially inside `minimal_kdof_reduction` and is

/-! ## Proposition 1.1, analytic half: generic rank `= D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`
(`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11`)

The last red node of Phase 21. Katoh–Tanigawa's Proposition 1.1 reconciles the *honest*
panel-hinge rigidity-matrix rank `R(G,p)` of `Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean` (Phase 18) with the
combinatorial deficiency `def(G̃)` of `Molecular/Deficiency.lean` (Phase 19): for a generic
panel-hinge realization `(G,p)`,
`rank R(G,p) = D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)` (Jackson–Jordán 2009 Thm 6.1, geometric side).

The **matroidal half** — `def(G̃) = corank M(G̃)`, equivalently `|B| + def(G̃) = D(|V|−1)` for
any base `B` of `M(G̃)` — landed green in Phase 19 (`Graph.rank_add_deficiency_eq`,
`Graph.isBase_ncard_add_deficiency_eq`). This file lands the **analytic half**, the bridge from
the rank `R(G,p)` to the deficiency, in the basis-free codimension convention of Phase 18: `rank
R(G,p) = D|V| − dim Z(G,p)` (`finrank_screwAssignment`), so the target equality `rank R(G,p) =
D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)` is precisely `dim Z(G,p) = D + def(G̃)`, i.e. `F.RankHypothesis (def(G̃))`
(`def:rank-hypothesis`, at `k' = def`).

It is **GREEN-modulo the Phase-21b genericity device**, assembled from the two inequalities that
pin the equality, in the established idiom of Cases I/II (`hglue`, `hspan`):

* *Genericity-free upper bound* `hub` (`rank R(G,p) ≤ D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`, equivalently `D +
  def(G̃) ≤ dim Z(G,p)`): the codimension form `lem:trivial-motions-rank-bound` together with the
  deficiency count. A vertex partition `P` attaining `def(G̃)` contracts each part to one effective
  body, leaving `D(|P|−1) − (D−1)·d_G(P) = partitionDef` independent screw freedoms in the null
  space beyond the `D` trivial motions; maximizing over `P` gives `def(G̃)` extra motions. This is
  genuine genericity-free content (no max-rank assumption — *every* realization has at least this
  many motions), still to be bricked from the Phase-19 partition machinery; carried here as an
  explicit hypothesis so the node is not blocked on it.
* *From Phase 21b (cited)* `hgen` (`rank R(G,p) ≥ D(|V|−1) − def(G̃)`, equivalently `dim Z(G,p) ≤ D
  + def(G̃)`): the generic max-rank lower bound — Theorem 5.5 (`theorem_55`) pushed from minimal
  `k`-dof-graphs to all multigraphs by deleting down to a minimal `k`-dof spanning subgraph and
  observing that re-adding edges only grows the rank (`lem:motions-mono-of-graph-le`). The
  generic-rank argument (Claim 6.4) selects the point attaining this max; that is the Phase-21b
  device. -/

/-! ## The genericity device (Claim 6.4/6.9) (`lem:genericity-device`, Phase 21b)

The shared analytic crux of Cases I/II, Theorem 5.5, Proposition 1.1, and the cycle-realization
assembly — Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.1 Claim 6.4 / §6.3 Claim 6.9. The entries of the panel-hinge
rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` are polynomials in the panel coordinates (the per-vertex normals), so
`rank R(G,p)` is lower semicontinuous and attains its maximum on a Zariski-open (generic) set:
a single realization `(G,p₀)` at a given rank lifts to *at least* that rank at the generic
realization. In the codimension convention of Phase 18 this is the dual statement — `dim Z(G,p)`
is upper semicontinuous, attaining its *minimum* generically.

This file lands the device in the **framework-facing codimension shape** the four consumers
carry (each is a `dim Z(G,p) ≤ target` upper bound, the codimension reading of `rank R ≥ …`),
assembled from the two Phase-21b bricks already in place:

* the analytic engine `LinearIndependent.finrank_dualCoannihilator_along_affine_path_cofinite`
  (`Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/Rank.lean`): along an affine path `t ↦ a i + t • b i` of
  *functionals* on a finite-dimensional space, a corank witnessed once at `t₀` (the subfamily
  indexed by `s` independent there) bounds the common kernel's `finrank` cofinitely above by
  `finrank V − #s`;
* the coordinatization `RigidityMatrix.infinitesimalMotions_eq_dualCoannihilator`:
  `Z(G,p) = (span (rigidityRows F)).dualCoannihilator`, the exact `dualCoannihilator`-of-a-span
  shape the engine consumes.

Composing them: if a panel-hinge realization is presented through an affine family of
rigidity-row functionals `t ↦ a i + t • b i` on the screw-assignment space `α → ScrewSpace k`
(with `(F t).infinitesimalMotions` the span's coannihilator at every `t`, the per-framework
coordinatization), and the subfamily `s` is independent at one realization `t₀`, then for
cofinitely many `t` the null space has `dim Z(F t) ≤ D|V| − #s`. The witnessed independent
subfamily `s` is supplied by the existence half `exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor`
(`lem:exists-independent-panel-extensor`, Phase 21 green), and `D|V| − #s` is the consumer's
target codimension. The conclusion is stated additively (`D|V| < #s + dim Z`) to sidestep
`ℕ`-subtraction, matching the engine's shape.

The remaining gap to per-consumer wiring (deferred to the next Phase-21b commits) is that the
panel rows are *affine* in this device's single scalar `t`, whereas the supporting extensor
`panelSupportExtensor n_u n_v = complementIso (n_u ∧ n_v)` is *bilinear* in the normals — so a
generic line through panel-coordinate space gives a row family that is quadratic, not affine, in
`t`. Each consumer must therefore present its rows as an affine family along a *chosen* path (the
single-scalar restriction route that worked for Phase 8's uniform-generic placement
`exists_uniform_rowIndependent_placement`), or the engine must be generalized to a multivariate
Zariski-open form; this device fixes the
framework-facing target shape that wiring lands into. -/

/-- **Genericity device, codimension form** (`lem:genericity-device`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
Claim 6.4 / Claim 6.9, Phase 21b). The genuine *multivariate* device: regard a panel-hinge
realization as a point `p : σ → ℝ` of the panel-coordinate space (the per-vertex normals), and
let `F : (σ → ℝ) → BodyHingeFramework k α β` be the resulting family of frameworks on fixed
bodies. The entries of the rigidity matrix `R(G,p)` are polynomials in `p` (degree two, bilinear
in the normals), so its null space is coordinatized by a *polynomial* family of rigidity-row
functionals: there is a fixed `c : ι → Fin (finrank (Dual (α → ScrewSpace k))) → MvPolynomial σ ℝ`
and a basis identification `φ` with the per-realization rows `g p i` satisfying
`φ (g p i) j = eval p (c i j)` (`hg`), and `(F p).infinitesimalMotions ≤
(span (range (g p))).dualCoannihilator` at every `p` (`hcoord`, the per-framework
`infinitesimalMotions_eq_dualCoannihilator` re-indexed; a *containment* rather than equality, so
the coordinate family `g p` is allowed to *under*-span the rigidity rows at degenerate `p` — which
only makes the null space larger and the codimension bound easier). If the subfamily indexed by
`s : Set ι`
is linearly independent at *one* realization `p₀` — the witnessed rank, supplied by
`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor` — then there is a point `p : σ → ℝ` at which the null
space attains the codimension bound `dim Z(F p) ≤ D|V| − #s`, stated additively as
`#s + dim Z(F p) ≤ D|V|` to sidestep `ℕ`-subtraction.

This is the "a rank attained at one realization is attained generically" mechanism the device
supplies to its consumers, re-read as the codimension upper bound `dim Z(G,p) ≤ target` each
carries (`hglue` for Case I, `hspan` for Case II, `hgen` for Proposition 1.1). It is a thin
composition of the multivariate analytic engine `exists_finrank_dualCoannihilator_polynomial`
with the coannihilator coordinatization, with `finrank (α → ScrewSpace k) = D|V|`
(`finrank_screwAssignment`) substituted for the engine's `finrank V`. Unlike the univariate
predecessor (a single affine line, `{bad}.Finite`), the parameter ranges over all of `σ → ℝ`:
the panel rows are bilinear in the normals, so the consumers' realizations are *not* reached
along any affine line, and the genuine engine produces a single good multivariate point. -/

panel-coordinate identification `φ` against an *arbitrary* finite basis index `ν` (with the
cardinality bridge `e : Fin (finrank (Dual ℝ (α → ScrewSpace k))) ≃ ν`) rather than the canonical

rigidity rows against the *concrete* standard basis `Pi.basis (fun _ => screwBasis k)` of
`α → ScrewSpace k` — indexed by `Σ _ : α, ⋀^k`-indices — at which each row coordinate
`(B.dualBasis.equivFun (g p i)) ⟨a, t⟩ = (g p i) (B ⟨a, t⟩)` is a degree-2 panel polynomial

/-- **B0 keystone: the genericity device applied to a varying panel realization**
(`lem:rows-polynomial-in-normals`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Claim 6.4/6.9, Phase 21b). The device
closure: it coordinatizes the rigidity rows of a *family* of panel-hinge frameworks `ofNormals G
ends q` — one per free normal assignment `q : α × Fin (k+2) → ℝ` — as degree-2 polynomials in `q`,
and runs the genericity device on the varying family. Given a fixed graph `G` whose endpoint
selector `ends` records each edge's link (`hends`) and all of whose hinges are transversal at the
seed (`hne`, e.g. moment-curve general position `isGeneralPosition_ofParam`), if at *one* normal
assignment `q₀` the rigidity rows indexed by `s` are linearly independent (`hindep`, the witnessed
corank, supplied by `exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor` through the hinge-row block), then
there is a normal assignment `q` at which the null space attains the codimension bound
`#s + dim Z(G,q) ≤ D|V|`.

This is the keystone the prior phase could only invoke on a *constant* family
(`exists_good_realization_const`): here the realization genuinely varies over panel-coordinate
space. The device inputs are assembled from the landed B0 bricks: the row family is the explicit
`panelRow` (`hingeRow` of the `annihRow` annihilator family); its `⋀^k`-coordinates against the
standard basis `Pi.basis (fun _ => screwBasis k)` are the degree-2 polynomials
`annihRowPoly` scaled by the body-incidence sign `[u=a] − [v=a]` (`hg`, via `dualBasis_equivFun` +
`annihRowPoly_eval` + `Pi.single_apply`); and the span identity `hcoord` is
`span_panelRow_eq_rigidityRows` composed with `infinitesimalMotions_eq_dualCoannihilator`. The
seed `q₀`'s general position is the moment-curve assignment, so this discharges the
device-application leg of the Case-I / Case-II producers. -/

realization` / `lem:case-I-realization`, the genericity-device closure; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §5–6,
Phase 21b). The honest *glue* both case producers reduce to once their geometry is placed: given a
free-normal panel family `ofNormals G ends q` (with `ends` recording each edge's link, `hends`) over
a nonempty body set `V(G)`, if at *one* normal assignment `q₀` the rigidity rows indexed by `s` are
linearly independent (`hindep`) and `s` meets the relative target count `#s ≥ D(|V(G)|−1)` (`hcard`,
the witnessed corank — the genuine geometric input), then `G` has a full-rank panel realization
`HasFullRankRealization k G`.

This is the device-direct composition `N2 ∘ N3`: the genericity device closure
`exists_relative_full_count_ofParam` (N2) lifts the witnessed corank at the seed `q₀` to a generic
normal assignment `q` at which `dim Z(G,q) ≤ D·(|α ∖ V(G)| + 1)`, and the relative-count adapter
`isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_vertexSet_of_finrank_le` (N3) turns that into rigidity on `V(G) =
V(ofNormals G ends q)`, the realization motive. The witness `(q₀, s)` is the *satisfiable* geometric
data — exactly what each case producer constructs: Case II places the re-inserted body's normal so
the `+(D−1)` new rows are independent (KT 6.12, `lem:case-II-realization-placement`), Case I places
the two splice legs on one framework with a block-triangular-independent forest of rows
(`lem:case-I-splice-placement`). It carries no laundered deliverable — `hindep`/`hcard` is the
witnessed-rank input the placement supplies, not the rank the lemma concludes, matching the honesty
split of the Case-I splice `glue`/`placement`. -/

/-- **N7b-2: the inductive rows transport through the common subgraph `G − v`**
(`lem:case-II-placement-old-rows`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.3, Lemma 6.8). The inductive realization
of the splitting-off `G_v^{ab}` is rigid on `V(G) ∖ {v}`, hence carries `D(|V(G)|−2)` linearly
independent rigidity rows of `ofNormals G_v^{ab} ends₁ q₁`. This lemma transports such an
independent family onto the parent `G`: along an *injective* reindex `f : s₂ → s₁` selecting the
`e₀`-free subfamily (the short-circuit edge `e₀` of `G_v^{ab}` is dropped; the remaining indices
are edges of the common subgraph `G − v`), with each selected row matching across the graph swap
(`hrow`: `panelRow` of `ofNormals G₂ ends₂ q₂` at `i` equals `panelRow` of `ofNormals G₁ ends₁ q₁`
at `f i`), the family is again linearly independent as rows of `ofNormals G₂ ends₂ q₂`.

The transport is **not** along an inclusion — neither `G_v^{ab}` nor `G` is a subgraph of the
other (the edge substitution adds `e₀`, deletes `v`'s two edges) — but both sit above `G − v`
(`Graph.removeVertex_le` and `Graph.removeVertex_le_splitOff`, green), and the `e₀`-free rows are
exactly the rows of `G − v`, which survive into `G`. The per-row match `hrow` is where the common
subgraph enters: when the assembly (`lem:case-II-realization-placement`, N7b) picks `q₀` extending
the inductive normals and `ends` agreeing on `G − v`'s edges, each `hrow i` is `rfl` (the panel
support extensor `(ofNormals · ends q).toBodyHinge.supportExtensor` reads only `ends` and `q`, not
the graph — `toBodyHinge_supportExtensor`). Independence is inherited as a subfamily of an
independent family (`LinearIndependent.comp` along the injective reindex). The short-circuit edge
`e₀`'s constraint is **not** transported here; it is recovered from `v`'s two new edges in N7b-1
(`exists_independent_panelRow_of_edge`). -/

(`lem:case-II-placement-old-rows-extract`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.3, Lemma 6.8). The *producer* of
the old block that the transport `exists_independent_panelRow_transport` (N7b-2) consumes: from the
inductive realization of `G_v^{ab}` — a panel-hinge framework infinitesimally rigid on its own
vertex set `V(F.graph)` (`hrig`, the realization motive `IsInfinitesimallyRigidOn`), all of whose
hinges are transversal (`hne`) — extract an *index subset* `s ⊆ E × ⋀^k-pairs` of size
`Nat.card s = D(|V(F.graph)|−1)` whose *actual* `panelRow ends`-subfamily is linearly independent,
in the honest index-subfamily form `exists_independent_panelRow_subfamily_of_edge` supplies for the
new block.

This is the **forward converse** of the relative-count adapter
`isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_vertexSet_of_finrank_le` (N3): that node turns a witnessed corank
`#s ≥ D(|V|−1)` *into* rigidity on `V(G)`; this node runs the implication backward — rigidity on
`V(F.graph)` forces `dim Z(G,p) = D·(|V(G)ᶜ| + 1)`
(`finrank_infinitesimalMotions_of_isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_vertexSet`), so the rigidity-row span,
the kernel-complement of `Z` (`infinitesimalMotions_eq_dualCoannihilator` + the complementary-
dimension identity `Subspace.finrank_dualCoannihilator_eq`), has dimension `D|V| − dim Z =
D(|V|−1)`. Under transversal hinges the panel rows span that whole space
(`span_panelRow_eq_rigidityRows`), so `Submodule.exists_fun_fin_finrank_span_eq` extracts an
independent subfamily of that many *actual* panel rows; re-indexing each by its
`(edge, ⋀^k-pair)` packages them as a genuine `panelRow`-index subset (injective since independent),
exactly as `exists_independent_panelRow_subfamily_of_edge`'s honest form does per edge.

It is **not** discharged by the transport `exists_independent_panelRow_transport` (which only
carries an *already-witnessed* family across the graph swap) nor by the forest-existence
`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_forest` (forest-count rows, bounded below the full `D(|V|−1)`
unless the block is rigid). This rank-equals-codimension forward direction is the genuine deficit
between "rigid on a set" and "carries that many independent rows". -/

/-- **Case I splice producer: two legs rigid on one parent placement give a full-rank realization**
(`lem:case-I-splice-placement` / `lem:case-I-realization`, the device-direct closure once the common
placement is named; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.2/6.5, eqs.\ (6.2), (6.3), (6.6), Phase 22). The honest
*glue* the Case-I producer reduces to once its geometry is placed on a single parent framework: a
seed normal assignment `q₀` (e.g.\ the moment-curve assignment, general position by
`isGeneralPosition_ofParam`) realizes the parent panel framework `ofNormals G ends q₀` on the whole
parent graph `G`, and *both* inductive legs — the proper rigid subgraph `GH` on `V(GH)` and the
contraction `Gc` on `V(Gc)`, each a subgraph of `G` carried on the *same* parent placement via
`withGraph` — are infinitesimally rigid on their own vertex sets. If the two legs share the
contracted body `c` (`hcH`, `hcc`) and together cover `V(G)` (`hcover`), then `G` has a full-rank
panel realization `HasFullRankRealization k G`.

This composes three green pieces into the device closure, isolating the remaining genuine geometric
obstruction (producing the common placement realizing both legs — the multivariate witness-transfer
of `lem:case-I-splice-placement`) into the two *satisfiable* leg hypotheses, not the parent rank it
concludes: (i) the block-triangular splice seed `isInfinitesimallyRigidOn_of_splice` glues the two
relatively-rigid legs along the shared body to rigidity of the parent on `V(G)`; (ii) the rigid
parent then carries `D(|V(G)|−1)` independent panel rows
(`exists_independent_panelRow_subfamily_of_rigidOn`, N7b-0 — every hinge transversal under the
general position of `q₀` and the distinct-endpoint hypothesis `hne_ends`); (iii) the genericity
device closure `hasFullRankRealization_of_independent_panelRow` lifts that witnessed corank at the
seed to a generic placement at the same rank. The deliverable rank is concluded, not assumed, so the
node is honest (the deferred obstruction is *exhibiting* `q₀` with both legs rigid, the genuine
content of `lem:case-I-splice-placement`). -/

isolating the single-seed witness-transfer; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.2/6.5, eqs.\ (6.2), (6.6),
Phase 22). The leg-native restatement of `hasFullRankRealization_of_splice`: rather than the two
legs phrased as `withGraph` of the *parent* framework `ofNormals G ends q₀`, the legs are stated
directly as the
leg-native frameworks `(ofNormals GH ends q₀).toBodyHinge` and `(ofNormals Gc ends q₀).toBodyHinge`
rigid on `V(GH)` resp.\ `V(Gc)` — *at the same seed* `q₀`. By `ofNormals_withGraph`
(`(ofNormals G ends q₀).withGraph G' = ofNormals G' ends q₀`) and `toBodyHinge_withGraph` the two
forms coincide, so this is a direct corollary of `hasFullRankRealization_of_splice`.

This is the shape the genuine remaining Case-I obligation reduces to: the seed witness-transfer must
produce *one* normal assignment `q₀` at which *both* leg graphs carry a rigid `ofNormals`
realization on their own vertex sets (the panel-intersection construction, eq.\ (6.6)). Building
each leg independently gives a leg-native rigid `ofNormals`; coupling them onto a single `q₀` is the
research-shaped step (`lem:case-I-splice-placement`, red). With that seed in hand, this lemma closes
`lem:case-I-realization` / `theorem_55.hcontract`. The deliverable rank is concluded, not assumed —

moment-curve general-position assignment; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.2/6.5, eqs.\ (6.2), (6.6),
Phase 22). The moment-curve specialization of `hasFullRankRealization_of_splice_ofNormals`: rather
than a free seed `q₀` carrying its own general-position hypothesis `hgp`, the seed is the
moment-curve assignment `q₀ = fun p ↦ momentCurve (param p.1) p.2` at an *injective* parameter map
`param : α → ℝ`. Then general position is automatic
(`isGeneralPosition_ofParam` — distinct bodies get distinct parameters, distinct-parameter
moment-curve points are independent), so `hgp` drops out of the consumer's obligation, and the two
leg hypotheses are stated at the explicit moment-curve seed `ofNormals · ends (fun p ↦ momentCurve
(param p.1) p.2)` — the value `ofParam · ends param` reduces to (`ofParam_eq_ofNormals_momentCurve`,
a `rfl`), kept in the `ofNormals` form so the leg framework terms match the parent brick
syntactically (the deep framework defeq is too costly to discharge by `rw` on the rigidity goal).

This is the shape the genuine remaining Case-I obligation reduces to once the genericity is fixed
to a single injective real assignment (the dimension-free general-position witness the rigid block
needs, where standard-basis normals cover only `|α| ≤ k + 2`): the seed witness-transfer must
produce *one* parameter map `param` at which *both* leg graphs carry a rigid `ofParam` realization
on their own vertex sets (the boundary-panel intersection of eq.\ (6.6) read off the moment curve).
With both legs rigid at one `param`, this lemma closes `lem:case-I-realization` /

/-- **Case I H-leg witness: a rigid leg rigid at one seed has a full-rank realization**
(`lem:case-I-splice-placement` / `lem:case-I-realization`, the single-leg specialization isolating
the *seed* obligation; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.2/6.5, eqs.\ (6.2), (6.6), Phase 22). The single-leg
analogue of `hasFullRankRealization_of_splice_ofNormals`: where the splice needs *both* legs rigid
at one shared seed, this packages just one leg — the rigid block `H` (= `G` here). From a
free-normal seed `q₀` at which the leg-native framework `ofNormals G ends q₀` is *itself* rigid
on `V(G)` (`hrig`, the satisfiable single-seed witness the transfer constructs), distinct hinge
endpoints (`hne_ends`), and general position of the seed (`hgp`, automatic at a moment-curve seed),
the leg has a full-rank panel realization `HasFullRankRealization k G`.

This is pieces (ii)+(iii) of `hasFullRankRealization_of_splice` run on the single leg, with the
block-triangular gluing (piece (i)) dropped — there is no second leg to glue. The rigid parent
carries `D(|V(G)|−1)` independent panel rows
(`exists_independent_panelRow_subfamily_of_rigidOn`, N7b-0 — every hinge transversal under general
position + `hne_ends`), and the genericity device closure
`hasFullRankRealization_of_independent_panelRow` lifts that witnessed corank at the seed to a
generic placement at the same rank. The deliverable rank is *concluded*, not assumed (honesty gate):
input `hrig` is the satisfiable single-seed rigidity of the leg, not the generic realization the
lemma produces.

This is the H-leg's non-empty rigidity-witness packaging the splice's witness-transfer
(`lem:case-I-splice-placement`, red) consumes: each leg's IH supplies *its own* full-rank
realization `HasFullRankRealization k GH` (resp.\ `k Gc`), i.e. some seed at which the leg is rigid;
this lemma is the bridge from that single-seed rigidity back up to the full-rank realization motive,
and the
genuine remaining obstruction is exhibiting *one shared* seed realizing *both* legs at once (the
multivariate non-zero-product / `MvPolynomial.funext` step). It carries no laundered deliverable —

lemma concludes. -/

(`lem:case-I-splice-placement` infra, the prerequisite of the single-seed witness-transfer;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.2/6.5,
Phase 22). The bridge from the realization motive `HasFullRankRealization k G` (the form the
inductive hypothesis supplies, an *arbitrary*-normal rigid framework `Q` on `G`) to the *`ofNormals`
shape* the seed witness-transfer must couple across the two legs: there exist an endpoint selector
`ends` and a free normal assignment `q : α × Fin (k+2) → ℝ` at which the leg-native framework
`ofNormals G ends q` is itself infinitesimally rigid on `V(G)`.

This is the first decomposable brick of the witness-transfer (`lem:case-I-splice-placement`, red):
each leg's IH gives *some* rigid framework `Q`, which is *literally* an `ofNormals` — set
`ends := Q.ends` and `q (a, i) := Q.normal a i`, and `ofNormals Q.graph Q.ends q = Q` definitionally
(`ofNormals` writes exactly `Q`'s three fields). `subst`-ing the conjunct `Q.graph = G` then lines
up both the framework equality and the `V(G)`-vs-`V(Q.graph)` rigidity argument by defeq. It carries
**no** rank assumption —
its sole input is the existence statement `HasFullRankRealization k G` the IH proves, so it is
honest (the rigid locus it witnesses *is* the realization the IH supplies, repackaged, not the rank
a producer would conclude). The genuine remaining content is to put *both* legs' rigid loci — each
non-empty by this brick — onto **one** shared `q₀` (the multivariate non-zero-product /

/-- **The device's coordinatization from a spanning enumeration of one realization's rigidity
rows** (`lem:genericity-device`, the route-(a) closure for Case I; Phase 21b). The route-(a)
resolution the hand-off flagged: the witness realization Case I needs is *constructed directly* by
the exterior-algebra existence lemma `exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor` (a basis choice on
`⋀²`, Phase 21/17), not found by perturbing along a path through panel-coordinate space. So the
multivariate family the device consumes can be the **constant** family `F p = F₀`, with `g p = a`
any family **spanning** the rigidity rows of the single good realization `F₀` (`hspanrows`); the
bilinearity obstruction (the panel rows are quadratic along a real line through normal-space) never
bites, because no path is traversed — the device reads off the corank `#s` at the one hand-built
realization, which is all Case I's block-triangular gluing needs.

This packages the constant family into the multivariate `exists_good_realization`: the
panel-coordinate variables `σ := Unit` are vacuous (the framework does not vary), the polynomial
coordinates are the constants `c i j = C (φ (a i) j)` (so `hg` is `eval_C`), and the
coordinatization `hcoord` is the per-framework `infinitesimalMotions_eq_dualCoannihilator` rewritten
under `hspanrows`. The basis identification `φ` is taken from any finite basis of the
finite-dimensional dual `α → ScrewSpace k` (`Module.finBasis … |>.equivFun`). The output is the
unquantified codimension bound `#s + dim Z(F₀) ≤ D|V|` at `F₀` itself — the form
`hglue_of_realization` consumes. The independent subfamily `s` (the engine's `hindep`) is supplied

for Case I: given a single body-hinge realization `F₀`, a finite family `a` of functionals
**spanning** its rigidity rows (`hspanrows`), a linearly independent subfamily indexed by `s`
(`hindep`, the witnessed corank, supplied by `exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor` through the
hinge-row block), and the **rank-match** `hmatch` — the witnessed corank `#s` equals the
contraction's inductive rank `D(|V|−1) − dim Z_s` — the block-triangular gluing inequality
`hglue : dim Z(G,p) ≤ D + dim Z_s` holds at `F₀` itself.

This is the route-(a) resolution promised in the hand-off: the bilinearity obstruction (panel rows
quadratic along a real line) is sidestepped because the witness realization `F₀` is *constructed*
by the exterior-algebra existence lemma rather than reached by perturbation, so the device runs on
the **constant** multivariate family `F p = F₀` (`exists_good_realization_const`), reading off the
corank `#s` at `F₀`. The arithmetic then substitutes `#s = D(|V|−1) − dim Z_s` (`hmatch`) into the
device's `#s + dim Z(F₀) ≤ D|V|`, collapsing `D|V| − (D(|V|−1) − dim Z_s)` to `D + dim Z_s` via

capstone in its consumer-ready form; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.1 Claim 6.4, Phase 21b). The bridge
that feeds the **assembled** independent rigidity-row family of
`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_forest` directly into the block-triangular gluing inequality,
discharging `hglue_of_realization`'s finite-spanning-family `a` and its independent-subfamily index
`s` once and for all.

`hglue_of_realization` is stated against a single finite family `a` that *spans* `F₀.rigidityRows`
together with an independent subfamily indexed by `s ⊆ ι` of `a` itself. The Case-I assembly,
however, produces its independent family `r : κ → Dual` (the `(D−1)·|J|` rows of a rigid block's
spanning forest of transversal hinges) as members of `F₀.rigidityRows` — *not* as a syntactic
subfamily of any pre-chosen spanning enumeration. This lemma closes that index gap with the
**concatenation** `a := Sum.elim r a₀`, where `a₀` is any finite family spanning the rigidity rows
(`exists_finite_spanning_rigidityRows`): its range is `range r ∪ range a₀`, and since `range r ⊆
span F₀.rigidityRows = span (range a₀)`, the concatenated family still spans the rigidity rows
(`hspanrows`); the subfamily indexed by `s := range Sum.inl` is exactly `r` (independent by
`hr`, transported across the `Sum.inl` reindexing). The corank then matches `Nat.card κ` (the
forest's `(D−1)·|J|`), so the route-(a) capstone fires with `hmatch` keyed to `κ` rather than to a
hand-chosen subset of an enumeration.

The residual per-consumer obligations are now exactly two and *both purely geometric*: (i) exhibit
the realization `F₀` (a `PanelHingeFramework`-via-`toBodyHinge` from the contraction realization
plus the rigidly placed block `V(H)`), supplying the forest data `r` via
`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_forest`; and (ii) the count match `hmatch`
(`Nat.card κ = D(|V|−1) − dim Z_s`) against the contraction's inductive `RankHypothesis`. No
spanning-family construction, no subfamily-index bookkeeping, and no affine path remain. -/

in its fully geometry-facing form; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.1 Claim 6.4, §6.2/6.5, Phase 21b). The
last reduction of the route-(a) chain before the genuinely-geometric `F₀` exhibition: it composes
the assembled forest family `exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_forest` (the rigid block's
`(D−1)·|J|` independent rigidity rows, indexed by `Σ _ : J, Fin (screwDim k − 1)`) straight into
the consumer bridge `hglue_of_independent_rigidityRows`, so the only remaining consumer obligation
is the *forest data itself* plus the count.

Concretely: given a single body-hinge realization `F₀` whose rigid block `V(H) = s_blk` carries a
spanning forest of transversal hinges — each hinge `e j` oriented from a *private endpoint* `u j`
(the forest child, `u` injective) to an arbitrary `other j`, with the forest-separation hypothesis
`hsep : ∀ j j', other j ≠ u j'` and every hinge transversal (`he : F₀.supportExtensor (e j) ≠ 0`)
— the block-triangular gluing inequality `hglue : dim Z(G,p) ≤ D + dim Z_s` holds at `F₀`, provided
only the **count match** `hmatch`: the forest's row count `|J|·(D−1)` equals the contraction's
inductive rank `D(|V|−1) − dim Z_s`. The forest rows discharge `hglue_of_independent_rigidityRows`'s
independent family `r` (via `linearIndependent_hingeRow_forest`) and its membership obligation
(each row is in `F₀.rigidityRows` by the hinge link `hlink j`); the cardinality
`Nat.card (Σ _ : J, Fin (screwDim k − 1)) = |J|·(D−1)` (`Nat.card_sigma`) keys `hmatch` to the
forest size.

This is the last *generic* (graph-and-hinge-agnostic) reduction. The remaining consumer work — the
genuinely-geometric Case-I assembly (KT §6.2/6.5) — is to exhibit, from the contraction realization
`G/E(H)` at its inductive `RankHypothesis` plus the rigidly placed block `V(H)`, the single
realization `F₀` (a `PanelHingeFramework`-via-`toBodyHinge`), the private-endpoint spanning forest
`u`/`other`/`e` of `V(H)`'s transversal hinges (transversality from
`exists_independent_panelSupportExtensor` general position), and the count `hmatch` against the

/-- **Case I panel capstone: a general-position rigid block realizes the rank** (`lem:case-I`, the
route-(a) panel-layer iff-realization; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.1 Claim 6.4, §6.2/6.5, Phase 21b).
The packaging of `hglue_of_forest` against a *panel*-hinge framework `P` whose normals are in
general position (`P.IsGeneralPosition`, e.g. the moment-curve assignment
`isGeneralPosition_withMomentNormals`): it sources the per-hinge transversality input `he` of
`hglue_of_forest` from the general position via `supportExtensor_ne_zero_of_isGeneralPosition`,
leaving the consumer only the *graph* data of the rigid block's spanning forest and the count.

Concretely, for the body-hinge interpretation `P.toBodyHinge` on a (nonempty) rigid block
`s = sblk` carrying a spanning forest of hinges — each `e j` linking a *private endpoint* `u j`
(the forest child, `u` injective) to an arbitrary `other j`, with the forest-separation hypothesis
`hsep : ∀ j j', other j ≠ u j'` and each hinge's panel endpoints matching its forest orientation
(`hends : P.ends (e j) = (u j, other j)`) — the framework realizes the target rank at `k'`
(`RankHypothesis k'`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D + k'`) **iff** the block pin `pinnedMotionsOn s` has
dimension `k'`, the contraction's inductive rank, provided the **count match** `hmatch`: the
forest's row count `|J|·(D−1)` equals `D(|V|−1) − dim Z_s`. Endpoint distinctness of each forest
hinge — the input `supportExtensor_ne_zero_of_isGeneralPosition` needs — is read off the
forest separation at the diagonal (`(hsep j j) : other j ≠ u j`, so `(P.ends (e j)).1 = u j ≠
other j = (P.ends (e j)).2` through `hends`), so no extra transversality hypothesis is required:
general position of the panel normals discharges every forest hinge at once.

This is the last reduction of the Case-I route-(a) chain that still mentions the panel general
position: it composes `hglue_of_forest` (the rigid block's `(D−1)·|J|` independent rigidity rows
feeding the block-triangular gluing) with `supportExtensor_ne_zero_of_isGeneralPosition` (every
forest hinge transversal under general position) into `toBodyHinge_rankHypothesis_iff_finrank_
pinnedMotionsOn`. The remaining consumer work — the genuinely-geometric Case-I assembly (KT
§6.2/6.5) — is the *graph-and-realization* exhibition: build `P` (a `PanelHingeFramework`, its
normals from `withMomentNormals` on an injective parameter map, so `IsGeneralPosition` for free) on
the parent graph `G` from the contraction realization `G/E(H)` plus the rigidly placed block
`V(H)`, exhibit the block's spanning forest `u`/`other`/`e` (with `hends` by construction), and
discharge the count `hmatch` against the contraction's inductive `RankHypothesis`. -/

/-- **Case I from-scratch realization entry point: a moment-curve framework realizes the rank**
(`lem:case-I`, the route-(a) panel-layer iff-realization specialized to the `ofParam` constructor;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.1 Claim 6.4, §6.2/6.5, Phase 21b). The packaging of the general-position
capstone `toBodyHinge_rankHypothesis_iff_pinnedMotionsOn_of_generalPosition` against the
from-scratch framework `ofParam G ends param` built directly on the parent multigraph `G`, its
hinge-endpoint selector `ends`, and an *injective* real parameter map `param`. Because the
moment-curve normals at an injective `param` are automatically in general position
(`isGeneralPosition_ofParam`), the per-hinge transversality input is discharged for free, and the
endpoint hypothesis `hends` of the capstone reduces to a statement about `ends` *directly*
(`ofParam_ends` is definitional).

Concretely, for the body-hinge interpretation `(ofParam G ends param).toBodyHinge` on a (nonempty)
rigid block `s = sblk` carrying a spanning forest of hinges — each `e j` linking a *private
endpoint* `u j` (the forest child, `u` injective) to an arbitrary `other j`, with the
forest-separation `hsep : ∀ j j', other j ≠ u j'`, each hinge a genuine link of `G`
(`hlink : G.IsLink (e j) (u j) (other j)`), and the endpoint selector matching the forest
orientation (`hends : ∀ j, ends (e j) = (u j, other j)`) — the framework realizes the target rank
at `k'` (`RankHypothesis k'`, i.e. `dim Z(G,p) = D + k'`) **iff** the block pin `pinnedMotionsOn s`
has dimension `k'`, provided the **count match** `hmatch` (`|J|·(D−1) = D(|V|−1) − dim Z_s`). This
is the realization-side entry point of the genuinely-geometric Case-I assembly (KT §6.2/6.5):
combinatorial inputs `(G, ends)` carry the geometry of the rigid-subgraph contraction
`G/E(H) ⊔ V(H)`, the forest data `u`/`other`/`e` is read off the rigid block, and the genericity is
the single injective real assignment `param`. The remaining consumer obligation is purely
combinatorial — exhibit the parent graph `G`, its endpoint selector `ends`, the block's spanning
forest, and discharge the count `hmatch` against the contraction's inductive `RankHypothesis`. -/

/-! ### Retired absolute-motive Case-I producers (Phase 21b re-plan)

The four `HasFullRankRealization` producers that lived here —
`hasFullRankRealization_ofParam_of_pinnedMotionsOn`,
`hasFullRankRealization_ofParam_of_isInfinitesimallyRigid`,
`hasFullRankRealization_ofParam_of_contraction`, and
`hasFullRankRealization_of_pinnedMotionsOn` — produced the *absolute* realization motive
`RankHypothesis 0` (`IsInfinitesimallyRigid`, constancy on all of `α`). A 2026-06-04 spike found
that motive unsatisfiable for the non-spanning inductive subgraphs the realization induction
reduces to (a body in `α ∖ V(G)` is a free non-trivial motion), so the producers were green only
over unsatisfiable hypotheses (`hpin`/`hHrig`/`hcrig` over `withGraph`-subgraphs rigid on the whole
`α`). They are retired here as the realization motive (`HasFullRankRealization`) is relativized to
`IsInfinitesimallyRigidOn V(G)`; the genuine device-direct producers (`lem:case-I-realization`,
`lem:case-II-realization`, built on the splice seed + B0 + the green genericity device) replace
them and remain red — see `notes/Phase21b.md` *Hand-off*. The accounting iffs
(`ofParam_rankHypothesis_iff_pinnedMotionsOn` and the nullity `RankHypothesis` chain) are retained
above. -/
