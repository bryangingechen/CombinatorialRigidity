# The matroid `M(G̃)`, deficiency, and `k`-dof graphs (`sec:molecular-deficiency`)

Phase 19, the third phase of the molecular-conjecture program (Phases 17–26; see
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). Where `Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean` (Phase 18)
built the *analytic* side — the panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)`, its rank,
and the three rank lemmas — this file builds the *matroidal* side: the matroid
`M(G̃)`, the `D`-deficiency, the `k`-degree-of-freedom hierarchy, rigid subgraphs,
and the bridge `def(G̃) = corank M(G̃)` of Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
(*A proof of the molecular conjecture*, Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, §2.5, §3).

This file lands the `sec:molecular-deficiency` dep-graph in dependency order. The
leaf node landing here:

* `matroidMG` (`def:matroid-MG`) — the matroid `M(G̃)`, where `G̃ = (D-1)·G` is the
  multiplied graph of Phase 16 (`Graph.edgeMultiply`, with `D = bodyBarDim n` so
  `D - 1 = bodyHingeMult n`). `M(G̃)` is the `(D,D)`-count matroid of `G̃` at the
  **boundary regime** `ℓ = 2k = D`: the `D`-fold union of the cycle (graphic)
  matroid of `G̃`, restricted to `E(G̃)`. This is *not* covered by the
  matroidal-regime construction of `CountMatroid.lean` (built for `ℓ < 2k`);
  `M(G̃)` is instead the `D`-fold graphic-matroid union of Phases 13/14, whose
  independence characterization is Tutte–Nash-Williams tree-packing.
* `matroidMG_indep_iff` (`def:matroid-MG`, the boundary-regime cleanliness check) —
  confirms the boundary regime is clean before the rest of the chapter relies on
  it: a bar set `E'` is independent in `M(G̃)` iff `E' ⊆ E(G̃)` and the
  edge-restricted subgraph `G̃ ↾ E'` is `(D,D)`-sparse, equivalently (by
  Tutte–Nash-Williams, `tutte_nash_williams`) decomposes into `D` edge-disjoint
  forests. The forward route is `unionPow_cycleMatroid_indep_iff_isSparse_restrict`
  (Phase 13) under matroid restriction `Matroid.restrict_indep_iff`.
* `partitionDef` / `deficiency` (`def:D-deficiency`) — the `D`-deficiency of a partition
  `P` of `V(G)`, `def(P) = D(|P| - 1) - (D-1)·d_G(P)`, and `def = max_P def(P)`. Partitions
  are encoded as labelings `f : α → α` (the fibers are the parts); `numParts` counts the
  parts `|P| = |f '' V(G)|` and `crossingEdges` collects the edges `d_G(P)` joining distinct
  parts. The deficiency is `ℤ`-valued (genuinely signed) and `≥ 0` by the trivial one-part
  partition (`partitionDef_one`).

* `IsKDof` / `IsMinimalKDof` / `edgeFiber` (`def:k-dof`) — `G` is a `k`-dof-graph
  when `def(G̃) = k`; minimal when additionally every base of `M(G̃)` meets every
  edge-fiber `ẽ` (the `D-1` parallel copies of `e ∈ E(G)`).
* `IsRigidSubgraph` / `IsProperRigidSubgraph` (`def:rigid-subgraph`) — a subgraph
  `H ≤ G` is *rigid* when it is `0`-dof, *proper rigid* when additionally
  `2 ≤ |V(H)|` and `V(H) ⊊ V(G)` (KT p. 659's `1 < |V′|`; without the lower bound a
  single vertex is vacuously rigid and "no proper rigid subgraph" is unsatisfiable).
  A *circuit* of `M(G̃)` is `Matroid.IsCircuit (G.matroidMG n)`.
* `matroidMG_restrict_mulTilde` (`lem:matroid-restrict-subgraph`) — the engine of
  KT Lemma 3.3: `M(G̃) ↾ E(H̃) = M(H̃)` for `H ≤ G`, via `Matroid.ext_indep` through
  `matroidMG_indep_iff` (so it never touches the `Matroid.Union` internals).
* `subgraph_minimality` (`lem:subgraph-minimality`, KT Lemma 3.3) — a subgraph
  `H ≤ G` of a minimal `k`-dof-graph `G`, with `def(H̃) = k'`, is a minimal
  `k'`-dof-graph. The base/fiber-meeting minimality transports from `G` to `H` over
  the restriction identity: a base `B'` of `M(H̃) = M(G̃) ↾ E(H̃)` extends to a base
  `B` of `M(G̃)` with `B' = B ∩ E(H̃)`, and each fiber `ẽ` of `e ∈ E(H) ⊆ E(G)` lies
  in `E(H̃)`, so `B ∩ ẽ ≠ ∅` (from `G`'s minimality) descends to `B' ∩ ẽ ≠ ∅`.

* `two_le_crossingEdges_of_isKDof_zero` (`lem:two-edge-conn`, KT Lemma 3.1) — a
  body-hinge-rigid (`0`-dof) graph is `2`-edge-connected, in cut form: any nonempty
  proper `V' ⊊ V(G)` separating `V(G)` has `d_G(V') ≥ 2`. (Mathlib has no
  edge-connectivity predicate for `Graph α β`, so the conclusion is the cut form KT's
  proof uses.) The bridge cut `{V', V∖V'}` (a two-part partition, `cutLabeling` /
  `numParts_cutLabeling`) would otherwise witness `def ≥ D - (D-1)·d_G(V') ≥ 1 > 0`
  through `partitionDef_le_deficiency`, contradicting `def = 0`.

* `rank_matroidMG_le` (`lem:rank-matroidMG-le`, the conjecture-relevant half of
  `thm:def-eq-corank`) — the rank upper bound `rank M(G̃) ≤ D·(|V(G)| - 1)` for
  `V(G).Nonempty`. Every base is `(D,D)`-sparse (boundary-regime cleanliness), so
  applying sparsity to the base itself gives `|B| + D ≤ D·|spanningVerts B| ≤ D·|V|`,
  i.e. `|B| ≤ D(|V|-1)`. This is the matroidal mirror of Phase 18's analytic
  `rank R(G,p) ≤ D(|V|-1)`; it is the upper-bound half the molecular conjecture
  (Thm 5.6) needs from the def = corank bridge — the reverse direction of the full
  Jackson–Jordán min–max identity (the partition attaining the rank) is deferred until
  a downstream node needs the full equality (risk #4, prove-vs-hypothesize).

* `isSparse_diff_singleton_of_isCircuit` (`lem:circuit-rigid`, KT Lemma 3.4 matroidal
  core) — for a circuit `X` of `M(G̃)` and `e ∈ X`, the set `X \ {e}` is `(D,D)`-sparse,
  equivalently an `M(G̃)`-basis of `X`: a circuit is exactly one edge short of being
  independent on its span. This is the upper-bound / maximal-sparse-subset form that KT's
  fundamental-circuit arguments (Phases 21–22) consume; the full `G[V(X)]`-is-rigid
  (`def = 0`, tightness *equality*) conclusion needs a vertex-induced-subgraph
  construction and is an early-Phase-20 deliverable.

* `rank_add_deficiency_eq` / `isBase_ncard_add_deficiency_eq` (`thm:def-eq-corank`;
  Jackson–Jordán 2009 Thm 6.1 / Cor 6.2) — the **def = corank bridge**
  `rank M(G̃) + def(G̃) = D(|V| - 1)` (equivalently `|B| + def(G̃) = D(|V| - 1)` for any
  base `B`), the `le_antisymm` of weak duality `rank_add_deficiency_le` (`def ≤ corank`) and
  its reverse `le_rank_add_deficiency` (`def ≥ corank`, the substantive JJ09 min–max content:
  the partition into the connected components of `G̃ ↾ Y₀`, for the Edmonds-optimal `Y₀`,
  attains the rank). Axiom-free.

(`def:matroid-MG`), where `D = bodyBarDim n`. Each hinge (edge) of `G` is replaced
by the `D - 1 = bodyHingeMult n` parallel copies that the body-hinge reduction of
Phase 16 attaches to it (`Graph.edgeMultiply`); the edge type becomes
`β × Fin (bodyHingeMult n)`. This is the graph the matroid `M(G̃)` lives over. -/

/-- The **matroid `M(G̃)`** (`def:matroid-MG`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §2.5): the
`(D,D)`-count matroid of the multiplied graph `G̃ = (D-1)·G` at the boundary regime
`ℓ = 2k = D` with `D = bodyBarDim n`. Concretely it is the `D`-fold union of the
cycle (graphic) matroid of `G̃`, restricted to the edge set `E(G̃)`.

This is the matroidal substrate of the molecular-conjecture program. The boundary
regime `ℓ = 2k = D` is *not* the matroidal regime `ℓ < 2k` of `CountMatroid.lean`;
`M(G̃)` is built instead from the `D`-fold graphic-matroid union of Phases 13/14
(`Matroid.Union (fun _ : Fin D ↦ (G̃).cycleMatroid)`), whose independence
characterization is Tutte–Nash-Williams tree-packing. The restriction `↾ E(G̃)` is
forced exactly as in Phase 14's `kFrameMatroid`: the vendored `Matroid.Union` has
ground set `univ : Set (β × Fin (bodyHingeMult n))`, so without the restriction
every non-edge would be a loop. -/

/-- **Boundary-regime cleanliness** of `M(G̃)` (`def:matroid-MG`): a bar set `E'` is
independent in `M(G̃)` if and only if `E' ⊆ E(G̃)` and the edge-restricted subgraph
`G̃ ↾ E'` is `(D,D)`-sparse, with `D = bodyBarDim n` and `G̃ = (D-1)·G`. This
confirms — as the first formalization step of Phase 19 — that the boundary regime
`ℓ = 2k = D` is clean before the rest of the chapter relies on it: the independent
sets of `M(G̃)` are exactly the `(D,D)`-sparse subsets of `G̃`.

By Tutte–Nash-Williams (`tutte_nash_williams`, applied to `G̃ ↾ E'`) these are
equivalently the bar subsets that decompose into `D` edge-disjoint forests. The
proof unfolds the restriction (`Matroid.restrict_indep_iff`) and feeds the
`D`-fold cycle-matroid union to Phase 13's
`unionPow_cycleMatroid_indep_iff_isSparse_restrict`. -/

with its `(D,D)`-sparsity inside `H̃ ↾ S` whenever `H ≤ G` and `S` lies within `E(H̃)`:
restriction to a fiber subset of the smaller graph cannot see the difference between
`H` and `G`. The edge sets coincide (`E(G̃ ↾ S) = S = E(H̃ ↾ S)`) and the spanned-vertex
counts coincide because the incidences of an edge `e ∈ E' ⊆ E(H̃)` agree under the
subgraph relation. This is the `IsSparse`-level engine of the matroid-restriction

/-! ## `D`-deficiency (`def:D-deficiency`)

A *partition* `P` of `V(G)` is encoded by a labeling `f : α → α` (the kernel of `f`,
i.e. its fibers, give the parts; vertices outside `V(G)` are irrelevant). The
*number of parts* `|P|` is the number of distinct `f`-labels carried by the
vertices of `G`, `|f '' V(G)|`, and the *crossing-edge count* `d_G(P)` is the
number of edges of `G` whose two endpoints receive different labels. KT's
`def_{\tilde G}(P) = D(|P| - 1) - (D-1)·d_G(P)` (`D = bodyBarDim n`) is genuinely
signed — a fine partition crossing many edges has *negative* deficiency — so it is
`ℤ`-valued; the deficiency `def(\tilde G) = max_P def_{\tilde G}(P)` takes the
maximum and is `≥ 0` (witnessed by the trivial one-part partition, `partitionDef_one`). -/

/-- The number of edges of `G` **crossing** the partition `P` (encoded by a labeling
`f : α → α`): edges `e ∈ E(G)` with endpoints `x, y` such that `f x ≠ f y`. This is
`d_G(P)` in Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §2.5. Counted with `Set.ncard` to match the project's
edge-counting idiom. -/

/-! ## `k`-dof and minimal `k`-dof graphs (`def:k-dof`)

A multigraph `G` is a *`k`-dof-graph* (`k` degrees of freedom) when
`def(G̃) = k`; the `0`-dof case is exactly the body-hinge-rigid case
(`thm:body-hinge-tay`). `G` is a *minimal `k`-dof-graph* when, additionally, no
edge can be deleted without changing the deficiency — encoded matroidally as:
every base `B` of `M(G̃)` meets every *edge-fiber* `ẽ` (the `D-1` parallel
copies `{p | p.1 = e}` of an edge `e ∈ E(G)`). Minimal `k`-dof-graphs are the
objects the combinatorial induction of Phase 20 (Theorem 4.9) reduces to the
two-vertex double edge. -/

/-- The **edge-fiber** `ẽ` of an edge `e ∈ E(G)` in the multiplied graph
`G̃ = (D-1)·G` (`def:k-dof`): the `D - 1 = bodyHingeMult n` parallel copies of `e`,
i.e. the set `{p : β × Fin (bodyHingeMult n) | p.1 = e}`. A base of `M(G̃)` meets
`ẽ` exactly when it retains at least one of the `D-1` copies of `e`. -/

`M(G̃)` — the base/fiber-meeting conjunct of `IsMinimalKDof` forces `B ∩ ẽ ≠ ∅` — but the
singleton `{p}` is *dependent*: by boundary-regime cleanliness (`matroidMG_indep_iff`)
its independence would make `G̃ ↾ {p}` `(D,D)`-sparse, demanding `1 + D ≤ D·|{x}| = D`.

/-! ## Rigid subgraphs and circuits (`def:rigid-subgraph`)

A subgraph `H ⊆ G` (`H ≤ G`, the multigraph `Graph.IsSubgraph` order) is *rigid*
when it is `0`-dof — `def(H̃) = 0` — equivalently (`thm:body-hinge-tay`) `H̃` packs
`D` edge-disjoint spanning trees. It is a *proper* rigid subgraph when its vertex
set is a proper subset on at least two vertices, `2 ≤ |V(H)|` and `V(H) ⊊ V(G)`
(Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 p. 659 requires `1 < |V′|`; without the lower bound the
single-vertex no-edge subgraph is vacuously rigid, so "no proper rigid subgraph"
would be unsatisfiable on any `G` with `2 ≤ |V(G)|`). A *circuit* of `M(G̃)` is a
minimal dependent edge set; this is mathlib's `Matroid.IsCircuit (G.matroidMG n)`.
These are the structural objects the algebraic induction of Phases 21–23 reduces
against (rigid subgraphs feed Case I, circuits feed `lem:circuit-rigid`). -/

/-- `H` is a **rigid subgraph** of `G` (`def:rigid-subgraph`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §3):
`H ≤ G` (a subgraph in the multigraph `Graph.IsSubgraph` order) and `H` is `0`-dof,
i.e. `def(H̃) = 0` with `H̃ = (D-1)·H` and `D = bodyBarDim n`. By
`thm:body-hinge-tay` this is exactly the body-hinge-rigid case: `H̃` packs `D`
edge-disjoint spanning trees. -/
def IsRigidSubgraph (H G : Graph α β) (n : ℕ) : Prop := H ≤ G ∧ H.IsKDof n 0

/-- `H` is a **proper rigid subgraph** of `G` (`def:rigid-subgraph`; Katoh–Tanigawa
2011 §3, p. 659): a rigid subgraph on at least two vertices whose vertex set is a
proper subset of `G`'s, `2 ≤ |V(H)|` and `V(H) ⊊ V(G)`. The `2 ≤ |V(H)|` lower bound
is KT's `1 < |V′|`: without it the single-vertex no-edge subgraph (vacuously `0`-dof —
every partition of one vertex has one part and no crossing edges) would make
`∃ H, IsProperRigidSubgraph` provable on any `G` with two vertices, so the standing
"no proper rigid subgraph" hypothesis of the Case-III layer would be unsatisfiable.
Proper rigid subgraphs are the case-I objects of the algebraic induction
(Phases 21–23). -/

/-! ## A triangle is `0`-dof (`lem:case-III`, the `splitOff`-simplicity triangle brick) -/

/-- **A triangle is body-hinge-rigid** (`0`-dof) for `D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 3`
(Katoh–Tanigawa 2011, "a triangle is a `0`-dof-graph", the `splitOff`-simplicity
obstruction of Lemma 6.7(ii)). Let `H` be a *triangle*: three distinct vertices
`x, y, z` pairwise joined by three distinct edges `exy, eyz, exz` (with `V(H) =
{x, y, z}` and `E(H) = {exy, eyz, exz}` exactly). Then `def(H̃) = 0`.

Unlike a circuit-induced rigid subgraph (`circuit_induces_isRigidSubgraph`), a
triangle at the regime `D ≥ 3` is *exactly* `(D,D)`-tight (`3(D−1) = 2D` at `D = 3`),
so no circuit of `M(H̃)` lives inside it and the circuit route does not apply.
Instead this is the direct `def ≤ 0` computation: `def(H̃) = ⨆_f def_{H̃}(P_f) ≤ 0`
by `ciSup_le`, because every partition `P_f` of the three vertices has `def_{H̃}(P_f)
= D(|P| − 1) − (D−1)·d(P) ≤ 0`. The three label-pattern cases (one part, two parts,
three parts) carry crossing-edge counts `d ∈ {0, 2, 3}` — the singleton-out-of-two
cut crosses both its edges, the all-distinct cut crosses all three — and the
arithmetic `(D−1)·d ≥ D(|P| − 1)` closes for `D ≥ 3` (`D ≥ 2` already suffices for
the two-part case; the three-part case is the binding `3(D−1) ≥ 2D ⟺ D ≥ 3`). With
`def(H̃) ≥ 0` (`deficiency_nonneg`) this forces `def(H̃) = 0`. -/

(the K₂-is-0-dof partition brick; sibling of `isKDof_zero_of_triangle`, used in G0

vertices `x, y` pairwise joined by two distinct parallel edges `e₁, e₂` (with `V(H) = {x, y}`
and `E(H) = {e₁, e₂}` exactly). Then `def(H̃) = 0`.

Proof: `def ≤ 0` by `ciSup_le`, since for every partition `f`: if `f x = f y` (one part,
no crossings) the deficiency is `0`; if `f x ≠ f y` (two parts, both edges cross) the
deficiency is `D·1 − (D−1)·2 = 2 − D ≤ 0` for `D ≥ 2`. Combined with `def ≥ 0`
(`deficiency_nonneg`) this forces `def(H̃) = 0`. -/

open Fin.NatCast Fin.CommRing in
/-- **A cycle is body-hinge-rigid** (`0`-dof) for `D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 3`, provided its length
`m` satisfies `m ≤ D` (Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.4.2, the cycle branch of Lemma 4.6; the general
form of `isKDof_zero_of_triangle`, which is the `m = 3` case). Let `H` be an `m`-cycle: `m`
distinct vertices `vtx 0, …, vtx (m−1)` joined cyclically by `m` distinct edges
`edge i : vtx i — vtx (i + 1)` (cyclic successor via `Fin m` addition), with `V(H) = range vtx`
and `E(H) = range edge` exactly. Then `def(H̃) = 0`.

Like the triangle (`isKDof_zero_of_triangle`) and unlike a circuit-induced rigid subgraph, a
cycle at the regime `3 ≤ m ≤ D` is *tight*, so this is the direct `def ≤ 0` computation:
`def(H̃) = ⨆_f def_{H̃}(P_f) ≤ 0` by `ciSup_le`, because every partition `P_f` has
`def_{H̃}(P_f) = D(|P| − 1) − (D−1)·d(P) ≤ 0`. The crux is the cyclic counting bound
`|P| ≤ d(P)` whenever `|P| ≥ 2`: a color class of `f` on the cyclic index `Fin m` that is
nonempty and (for ≥ 2 parts) a *proper* subset cannot be closed under the cyclic successor
(the successor generates `Fin m`), so each part has a boundary index whose edge crosses `P` —
an injection parts ↪ crossing edges. Combined with `|P| ≤ m ≤ D`, the arithmetic
`(D−1)·d(P) ≥ (D−1)|P| ≥ D(|P|−1)` closes; with `def(H̃) ≥ 0` (`deficiency_nonneg`) this forces
`def(H̃) = 0`. -/

/-! ## Subgraph minimality (`lem:subgraph-minimality`; KT Lemma 3.3) -/

/-- **Subgraph minimality** (`lem:subgraph-minimality`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 3.3):
a subgraph `H ≤ G` of a minimal `k`-dof-graph `G` is itself a minimal `k'`-dof-graph,
where `k' = def(H̃)` is whatever deficiency `H` happens to have. (In particular a
*rigid* subgraph — `k' = 0` — of a minimal `k`-dof-graph is a minimal `0`-dof-graph,
the form used in Cases I/III of the algebraic induction.)

The deficiency half (`H.IsKDof n k'`) is supplied as a hypothesis (it is the definition
of `k'`); the content is the base/fiber-meeting minimality transport. The engine is the
matroid identity `M(G̃) ↾ E(H̃) = M(H̃)` (`matroidMG_restrict_mulTilde`): a base `B'` of
`M(H̃)` is an `M(G̃)`-basis of `E(H̃)` (`isBase_restrict_iff'`), so it extends to a base
`B ⊇ B'` of `M(G̃)` (`Indep.exists_isBase_superset`) with `B' = B ∩ E(H̃)` by maximality
(`IsBasis'.eq_of_subset_indep`). Each edge-fiber `ẽ` of an `e ∈ E(H) ⊆ E(G)` lies inside
`E(H̃)`, so `G`'s minimality (`B ∩ ẽ ≠ ∅`) transports to `B' ∩ ẽ = (B ∩ E(H̃)) ∩ ẽ =

/-- **A vertex-cardinality-maximal proper rigid subgraph exists** (the existence half of
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Claim 6.6, p. 676–677; the leaf the Lemma-6.5 vertex-removal arm of the
Case-I dispatch bottoms out on). If `G` has *any* proper rigid subgraph, then it has one,
`G'`, whose vertex set is of maximal cardinality among all proper rigid subgraphs. Maximality
is recorded against `V(·).ncard`; since `V(H) ⊆ V(G)` for every subgraph, a strict
vertex-superset would have strictly larger cardinality, so the cardinality-maximal witness is
also vertex-inclusionwise maximal — the form Claim 6.6 consumes when it extends `G'` by the
removed vertex `v` and forces `V(G) = V(G') ∪ {v}`.

The pick is a finite-maximum argument: with `α` finite, the achievable vertex-cardinalities
form a nonempty (`hrig`) set of naturals bounded above by `|V(G)|`, so `Nat.findGreatest`
locates the largest one and a witnessing subgraph. No rigidity-matrix or genericity content —
purely the bounded-maximum existence. -/

/-- **Deficiency is antitone under edge addition at fixed vertex set** (`def:D-deficiency`):
if `H ≤ H'` (a subgraph relation) and `V(H) = V(H')` (equal vertex sets), then
`def(H̃') ≤ def(H̃)`. More edges at the same vertex set can only *increase* crossing counts,
which *decreases* each partition's deficiency `D(|P|−1) − (D−1)·d(P)` (since `D−1 ≥ 0`).

Concretely: the vertex-set equality gives `numParts H f = numParts H' f` (same image
`f '' V(H) = f '' V(H')`), and the subgraph relation gives `crossingEdges H f ⊆
crossingEdges H' f` (every `H`-link is an `H'`-link). So `partitionDef H' n f ≤
partitionDef H n f` for every labeling `f`, and the supremum respects this order.

This is the one new brick the loop-case fix (§1.70(c′)) needs: it lifts `G₀`'s rigidity
(`IsKDof n 0`) to the induced subgraph `G' := G.induce V(G₀)`, which carries every
`G`-edge inside `V(G₀)` by `edgeSet_induce`, making `G' ≥ G₀` at equal vertex sets. -/

/-- **A vertex-cardinality-maximal *induced* proper rigid subgraph exists** (the
induced-saturation opener of Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Claim 6.6, the §1.70(c′) loop-case fix of
the Lemma-6.5 vertex-removal arm of the Case-I dispatch). The plain
`exists_maximal_isProperRigidSubgraph` returns a vertex-maximal proper rigid *subgraph* `G₀`,
but `IsProperRigidSubgraph` is the plain-subgraph relation — a `G`-edge with both ends in
`V(G₀)` need not lie in `E(G₀)`. KT's argument silently assumes the maximal subgraph is
edge-saturated within its vertex set; that is exactly the *induced* subgraph.

This lemma supplies the saturated form directly: a proper rigid subgraph `G'` that is (a)
vertex-cardinality-maximal among all proper rigid subgraphs and (b) **induced-saturated** —
every `G`-edge with both ends in `V(G')` already lies in `E(G')`. The saturation conjunct is
the `hHsat` hypothesis of `exists_isLink_pair_of_rigidContract_not_simple`, so a caller fed
`G'` here can take the contraction-non-simplicity straight to its parallel disjunct (the loop
disjunct being vacuous on a saturated subgraph).

Construction: take the plain maximal `G₀` (`exists_maximal_isProperRigidSubgraph`) and replace
it by its induced saturation `G' := G.induce V(G₀)`. Then `V(G') = V(G₀)`, so `G'` inherits
`G₀`'s cardinality-maximality and properness; `G₀ ≤ G'` at the same vertex set lifts `G₀`'s
rigidity to `G'` via `deficiency_le_deficiency_of_le_vertexSet_eq` (more edges at the same
vertices only lower the deficiency, and `deficiency_nonneg` pins it back to `0`); and saturation
is the defining property of `induce` (`edgeSet_induce`). -/

/-! ## A circuit yields a rigid subgraph (`lem:circuit-rigid`; KT Lemma 3.4) -/

/-- **A circuit minus an edge is a maximal sparse subset** (`lem:circuit-rigid`;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 3.4, matroidal core). Let `X` be a circuit of `M(G̃)` and
`e ∈ X`. Then `X \ {e}` is `(D,D)`-sparse — equivalently, an `M(G̃)`-basis of `X`
(`X \ {e}` is a maximal independent subset of `X`, and `X` itself is dependent). This
is the structural content KT's fundamental-circuit arguments consume (Lemmas 4.5,
6.10–6.11 of the algebraic induction, Phases 21–22): a circuit is exactly one edge
short of being independent on its vertex span.

KT's full Lemma 3.4 concludes that the vertex-induced subgraph `G[V(X)]` is *rigid*
(`0`-dof) — more precisely that `X − e` partitions into `D` edge-disjoint spanning
trees on `V(X)`, i.e. `|X − e| = D(|V(X)| − 1)` exactly. That tightness *equality*
(and the `def(G[V(X)]̃) = 0` reading of it) needs the **lower** bound `|X| >
D(|V(X)| − 1)` forced by `X` being dependent, which in this count matroid is the
reverse direction of the full `def = corank` min–max (`thm:def-eq-corank`, the JJ09
generic-rank identity, risk #4) — deferred with that node. The `(D,D)`-sparse /

/-! ## Two-edge-connectivity (`lem:two-edge-conn`; KT Lemma 3.1)

A body-hinge-rigid (`0`-dof) graph `G` is `2`-edge-connected. Mathlib carries no
edge-connectivity predicate for the multigraph `Graph α β` (only for `SimpleGraph`),
so — as flagged in `notes/Phase19.md` — the lemma is phrased directly in the cut form
Katoh–Tanigawa's proof actually uses: for the cut `{V', V∖V'}` induced by a nonempty
proper vertex set `V' ⊊ V(G)`, the number of edges crossing the cut is `≥ 2`. A
crossing count of `≤ 1` would let the trivial bridge cut `{V', V∖V'}` witness
`def(G̃) ≥ D·(2-1) - (D-1)·d_G(P) ≥ D - (D-1) = 1`, contradicting `def(G̃) = 0`. -/

/-- The **cut labeling** of a vertex set `V'`: the labeling `f : α → α` collapsing `V'`
to a representative `a` and its complement to `b`. Its fibers on `V(G)` are `V'` and
`V(G) ∖ V'`, so it encodes the partition `P = {V', V∖V'}` whose crossing edges are
`d_G(V')`. Used by `lem:two-edge-conn` to feed a bridge cut to `partitionDef`. -/

distinct `b ∈ V(G) ∖ V'`) has exactly two parts: `numParts G (cutLabeling V' a b) = 2`.
The image of `V(G)` is `{a, b}` (every vertex maps to one or the other; both are hit by
`a` itself and `b` itself), and `a ≠ b` because `b ∉ V'`. -/

/-- **Two-edge-connectivity in cut form** (`lem:two-edge-conn`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
Lemma 3.1): a body-hinge-rigid (`0`-dof) graph `G` admits no bridge cut. For a nonempty
proper vertex set `V' ⊊ V(G)` that separates `V(G)` (witnessed by `a ∈ V' ⊆ V(G)` and a
distinct `b ∈ V(G) ∖ V'`), at least two edges cross the cut `{V', V∖V'}`:
`2 ≤ d_G(V') = |crossingEdges G (cutLabeling V' a b)|`.

Proof (KT Lemma 3.1): the cut `{V', V∖V'}` is a two-part partition
(`numParts_cutLabeling`), so `def_{G̃}(P) = D·(2-1) - (D-1)·d_G(P) = D - (D-1)·d_G(P)`.
If `d_G(P) ≤ 1` then `def_{G̃}(P) ≥ D - (D-1) = 1 > 0 = def(G̃)`, contradicting that the
deficiency (an upper bound for every partition, `partitionDef_le_deficiency`) is `0`.

The four lemmas below are the degree-bridge infrastructure for the L1a slice of Phase 22i:
`crossingEdges_cutLabeling_singleton_subset` and `crossingEdges_cutLabeling_singleton_ncard_le`
give the cut↔degree bridge at a single vertex; `cutEdges`/`TwoEdgeConnected` introduce the
labeling-free V2 predicate; `cutEdges_eq_crossingEdges_cutLabeling` transfers between the two
encodings; `twoEdgeConnected_of_isKDof_zero` and `two_le_degree_of_twoEdgeConnected` are the
two main consequences. `preconnected_of_twoEdgeConnected` adds the connectivity half; the
`IsKDof n 0` compositions `two_le_degree_of_isKDof_zero` / `preconnected_of_isKDof_zero`
(ENTRY leaf E2a, `notes/Phase23-design.md` §(4.107.D)) package both for KT Lemma 4.6. -/

`a ≠ b`) are exactly the *nonloop* edges incident to `v`: an edge crosses iff exactly one of
its endpoints is `v`. This is the structural fact linking the project's cut count `d_G(V')`
to the vendored multigraph degree `Graph.degree`. -/

least two edges. Connectivity is **included** automatically: a connected component `V'`
of a disconnected `G` would have `cutEdges G V' = ∅`, violating the `2 ≤` bound (since
`∅.ncard = 0 < 2`). At `|V(G)| ≤ 1` the predicate holds vacuously (KT's convention). -/

N4a infrastructure below `lem:rigidContract-isMinimalKDof`; `notes/Phase22.md`). For a
`0`-dof graph `G` with `D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 2` (so `bodyHingeMult n = D - 1 ≥ 1`, i.e.
`G̃` carries an edge copy of each hinge — the regime KT works in, `n ≥ 2`), the multiplied
graph `G̃ = (D-1)·G` is preconnected: every pair of vertices is joined by a walk
(vacuous on the empty graph, so no nonemptiness hypothesis). This is the
hypothesis a `cycleMatroid`-under-vertex-collapse argument needs to license the
`collapseTo r V(H)` collapse on a proper rigid subgraph `H` (a disconnected `H` would
collapse several components to one representative, which is not the connected contraction
the cycle matroid sees).

Proof (the cut-partition contradiction of `two_le_crossingEdges_of_isKDof_zero`, run for
connectivity rather than two-edge-connectivity): if `G̃` were *not* preconnected, two
vertices `x, y ∈ V(G)` would lie in distinct components. The connected component
`V' = {z | G̃.ConnBetween x z}` is then a nonempty proper subset of `V(G)` that no edge of
`G` crosses — every `G`-edge `e` linking `u ∈ V'` to `v` lifts to a `G̃`-edge (copy `0`),
so `v` is connected to `x`, hence `v ∈ V'`. The induced two-part cut therefore has
`d_G(V') = 0`, so its deficiency is `D·(2-1) - (D-1)·0 = D ≥ 1 > 0 = def(G̃)`,

/-! ## KT Lemma 3.6 bricks (`lem:cut-edge-decomposition`)

Five lemmas for the cut-edge decomposition (KT Lemma 3.6, p. 659):
`partitionDef_congr` (reads `f` only on `V(G)`), `partitionDef_comp_of_injOn`
(relabeling invariance), `partitionDef_split_of_sides` (the exact split of a
side-separated labeling), `exists_sides_separated_partitionDef_le` (the refinement
bound: `≤ 1` cut edge means a side refinement does not decrease `partitionDef`),
and `deficiency_eq_of_cutEdges_ncard_le_one` (KT Lemma 3.6). The ¬2EC packaging
`exists_cut_decomposition_of_not_twoEdgeConnected` follows in the same section. -/

/-- **`partitionDef` reads `f` only on `V(G)`** (`lem:cut-edge-decomposition`).
If `f` and `g` agree on the vertex set `V(G)` (i.e. `Set.EqOn f g V(G)`), then
`partitionDef G n f = partitionDef G n g`. Both `numParts` and `crossingEdges`
only observe `f`-values at vertices of `G`. -/

/-- **Relabeling invariance** (`lem:cut-edge-decomposition`): post-composition with
a map `g` that is injective on the carried labels `f '' V(G)` does not change
`partitionDef`. That is, `partitionDef G n (g ∘ f) = partitionDef G n f` when
`g` is injective on `f '' V(G)`.

Proof: `|(g ∘ f) '' V(G)| = |g '' (f '' V(G))| = |f '' V(G)|`
(by `Set.InjOn.ncard_image`); and `g (f x) ≠ g (f y) ↔ f x ≠ f y` for
`x, y ∈ V(G)` (since `f x, f y ∈ f '' V(G)` and `g` is injective there), so
`crossingEdges G (g ∘ f) = crossingEdges G f`. -/

/-- **Exact split of a side-separated labeling** (`lem:cut-edge-decomposition`).
For a labeling `g` that is *side-separated* (no label crosses the bipartition
`{V₁, V(G) ∖ V₁}`: `∀ x ∈ V₁, ∀ y ∈ V(G) ∖ V₁, g x ≠ g y`), the `D`-deficiency
of `G` under `g` splits exactly as:

  `partitionDef G n g`
    `= partitionDef (G.induce V₁) n g + partitionDef (G.induce (V(G) ∖ V₁)) n g`
    `  + D - (D - 1) * |cutEdges G V₁|`  (with `D = bodyBarDim n`, arithmetic in `ℤ`)

The split decomposes both `numParts` and `crossingEdges`:
* `numParts G g = numParts (G.induce V₁) g + numParts (G.induce (V(G) ∖ V₁)) g`:
  the label images of the two sides are disjoint by `hsep`, so their union over `V(G)`
  has ncard equal to the sum.
* `crossingEdges G g = crossingEdges (G.induce V₁) g ∪ crossingEdges (G.induce (V(G) ∖ V₁)) g
  ∪ cutEdges V₁`: every edge of `G` is within `V₁`, within `V(G) ∖ V₁`, or crossing;
  cut edges cross by `hsep`; the three pieces are pairwise disjoint.
The `ℤ` arithmetic then closes by `ring`. -/

/-- **Side-separation refinement does not decrease `partitionDef`**
(`lem:cut-edge-decomposition`). Given a vertex set `V₁ ⊆ V(G)` with at most one
crossing edge (`|cutEdges G V₁| ≤ 1`) and any labeling `f : α → α`, there exists a
side-separated labeling `g` (no label crosses the bipartition) such that
`G.partitionDef n f ≤ G.partitionDef n g`.

Proof: define `g` by injecting the pairs `(f x, side x)` (where `side x = 0` if `x ∈ V₁`,
else `1`) into `V(G)` via `Set.Finite.exists_injOn_of_encard_le` (there are at most
`|V(G)|` such pairs since each pair determines a vertex up to its piece). The injection `ι`
is then set `g x = ι (pair x)` for `x ∈ V(G)`. Side-separation is immediate from
injectivity (pairs in `V₁` have second coordinate `0`, pairs outside have `1`, so they
are always distinct). Counting: `numParts G g ≥ numParts G f + s` (`s` = straddling parts),
`crossingEdges G g` gains at most one new edge (only a cut edge inside an `f`-part can newly
cross under `g`, and `hcut` bounds the cut). The net change is `≥ D·s − (D−1)·1 ≥ 0`. -/

/-! ## Partition-respecting cycle-matroid rank bound (`thm:def-eq-corank`, piece 1)

The leaf the weak-duality half of the def = corank bridge bottoms out on: for the
edge set `Y` of `G̃` whose every edge stays *within* a part of the partition `P`
encoded by `f` (no crossing edge), the cycle-matroid rank is bounded by
`r_{cycle}(Y) ≤ |V(G)| - |P|`. The point is *rank ≤ vertices − components* together
with *components ≥ #parts*: a within-part edge keeps connectivity inside a part, so
the connected components of `(G̃ ↾ Y)` refine the partition, hence there are at least
`|P| = numParts` of them. -/

/-- A labeling `f` that agrees across the endpoints of every edge of `Y` is constant
on each connected component of the restriction `H ↾ Y`: if `x` and `y` are joined by a
walk in `H ↾ Y`, then `f x = f y`. Proof by induction on the walk — each `cons` step is
an `H ↾ Y`-link, hence an `H`-link with edge in `Y`, so `f` agrees across it. The engine

/-- **Partition-respecting cycle-matroid rank bound** (`thm:def-eq-corank`, piece 1;
the components-refine-the-partition leaf). For the multiplied graph `G̃ = (D-1)·G`,
the edge set `Y` of within-part fibers under the partition `P` encoded by `f` (every
edge of `Y` joins two equally-labeled vertices) satisfies
`r_{cycle}(Y) + numParts f ≤ |V(G)|`, i.e. `r_{cycle}(Y) ≤ |V(G)| - |P|`.

Via the cycle-matroid rank–component identity `eRank + c = |V|` on the restriction
`G̃ ↾ Y` (which keeps every vertex, so `V(G̃ ↾ Y) = V(G̃) = V(G)`): the rank is
`|V(G)| - c(G̃ ↾ Y)`, and `c(G̃ ↾ Y) ≥ numParts f` because the labeling is constant on
each component (`label_eq_of_connBetween`), so the map sending a label to the component
of one of its vertices is injective. -/

/-! ## Weak duality (`thm:def-eq-corank`, piece 2)

For every partition `P` of `V(G)`, `rank M(G̃) + def_{G̃}(P) ≤ D(|V| - 1)`, hence
(maximising over `P`) `rank M(G̃) + def(G̃) ≤ D(|V| - 1)` — the `def ≤ corank`
half of the bridge. The Edmonds matroid-partition rank formula (`Union_pow_rk_eq`)
on `X := E(G̃)` with the non-crossing fibers `Y` bounds `rank M(G̃) ≤ D·r_cycle(Y) +
|E(G̃) ∖ Y|`; piece 1 (`rk_cycleMatroid_within_parts_le`) bounds `D·r_cycle(Y) ≤
D(|V| - |P|)`, and the bookkeeping leaf `|E(G̃) ∖ Y| = (D-1)·d_G(P)` (each crossing
edge contributes its `D-1` fibers) makes the two sides match. -/

/-- The **crossing fibers** of `G̃` under the partition `P` encoded by `f`: the fibers
`p ∈ E(G̃)` whose underlying edge `p.1` crosses `P`. Equivalently `E(G̃) ∖ Y` for the
non-crossing fibers `Y`. There are exactly `(D-1)·d_G(P)` of them — each of the
`d_G(P) = |crossingEdges G f|` crossing edges of `G` contributes its `D-1` parallel
copies. -/

/-! ## The reverse inequality (`thm:def-eq-corank`, piece 3)

The substantive Jackson--Jordán min–max content: a vertex-partition `P` attaining the
rank, giving `rank M(G̃) + def_{G̃}(P) ≥ D(|V| - 1)`, equivalently
`def(G̃) ≥ corank M(G̃)`. The optimal edge set `Y₀ ⊆ E(G̃)` of the Edmonds
partition-rank formula (`Union_pow_rk_eq`, existence half) induces a partition `P`
of `V(G)`: the connected components of `G̃ ↾ Y₀`. For that partition the within-part
fibers are exactly `Y₀`, so `r_cycle(Y₀) = |V| - |P|`, and every crossing edge has all
`D-1` of its fibers outside `Y₀`, so `(D-1)·d_G(P) ≤ |E(G̃) ∖ Y₀|`. Together with the
optimal bound `D·r_cycle(Y₀) + |E(G̃) ∖ Y₀| ≤ rank` this gives the reverse inequality. -/

/-- **Weak duality is tight: the reverse inequality** (`thm:def-eq-corank`, piece 3). For a
multigraph `G` with `V(G) ≠ ∅` and `D ≥ 1`, the partition `P` into the connected components

`rank M(G̃) + def_{G̃}(P) ≥ D(|V| - 1)`, hence `rank M(G̃) + def(G̃) ≥ D(|V| - 1)`, i.e.
`def(G̃) ≥ corank M(G̃)`. With `rank_add_deficiency_le` this is the full bridge.

The existence half of the Edmonds partition-rank formula (`Union_pow_rk_eq`) provides an

(`rk_add_numParts_componentLabel`); and every crossing edge's `D-1` fibers all lie outside

/-- **Minimality + subgraph + equal vertex set + 0-dof ⟹ equality** (`lem:subgraph-minimality`;
KT Lemma 3.3 corollary): if `G` is a minimal `0`-dof-graph, `G'' ≤ G` is a subgraph with
`V(G'') = V(G)` and `G''` is also `0`-dof, then `G = G''`.

Proof: assume for contradiction that there is a `g ∈ E(G) ∖ E(G'')`. Get a base `B''` of
`M(G̃'')`. By the restriction identity `M(G̃) ↾ E(G̃'') = M(G̃'')` (`matroidMG_restrict_mulTilde`),
`B''` is `M(G̃)`-independent. Since `G''` is `0`-dof and `V(G'') = V(G)`,
`|B''| = D(|V(G)| - 1)` (`isBase_ncard_add_deficiency_eq`). Since `G` is `0`-dof,
`rank M(G̃) = D(|V(G)| - 1)`, so `B''` is a base of `M(G̃)`. Minimality of `G` (`hG.2`)
gives `p ∈ B'' ∩ ẽ_g ≠ ∅`; but `p ∈ E(G̃'')` forces `p.1 ∈ E(G'')`,
contradicting `g = p.1 ∉ E(G'')`.

This is the **step-4 bridge** the Lemma-6.5 arm of the Case-I dispatch (KT Claim 6.6,
Phase 22k L8a) uses after building `G'' := (G'.addEdge eₐ v a).addEdge e_b v b`: maximality
of `G'` forces `V(G'') = V(G)`, and `G''` is `0`-dof by the vertex-removal deficiency count
(`removeVertex_deficiency_ge`), so `G = G''` and `v` has degree exactly 2 in `G`. -/

direction, the strip brick of the `d = 3` Theorem 5.6 feed, Phase 22k L10a; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
p. 670, the "delete edges keeping the rank" half). Every graph `G` (with `D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 1`
and a nonempty vertex set) has a *spanning* subgraph `G'` (`V(G') = V(G)`) that is a **minimal**
`def(G̃)`-dof-graph: `G' ≤ G`, `def(G̃') = def(G̃)`, and no edge of `G'` can be deleted without
raising the deficiency. This is the converse direction to `subgraph_minimality` (which needs `G`
*already* minimal); the strip starts from an arbitrary `G` and removes deficiency-irrelevant edges.

Construction (a finite minimum, not a well-founded recursion): among all edge subsets `F ⊆ E(G)`
whose restriction `G ↾ F` has the same deficiency as `G` (`G` itself witnesses `F = E(G)`), pick one
of minimal cardinality (`Set.exists_min_image`, finite because `[Finite β]`). Set `G' := G ↾ F₀`.
Then `V(G') = V(G)` (`restrict` fixes vertices) and `def(G̃') = def(G̃)` by choice; the
base/fiber-meeting minimality is the contrapositive of the minimum: a base `B` of `M(G̃')` missing
the fiber `ẽ` of some `e ∈ E(G')` lives in `E((G ↾ (F₀ ∖ {e}))~)`, where it is independent of full
size, so deleting `e` preserves the deficiency (`isBase_ncard_add_deficiency_eq` on both graphs +
`deficiency_le_deficiency_of_le_vertexSet_eq` for the `≥` bound) — contradicting minimality of
`|F₀|`.

The strip mints no blueprint node; it is `\uses`-only infrastructure for the `def > 0`
`prop:rigidity-matrix-prop11` producer. -/

/-- **A rigid subgraph's multiplied graph packs `D` edge-disjoint forests on a base**
(`thm:def-eq-corank` Cor 6.2; Jackson–Jordán 2009, Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §6.2). The
combinatorial substrate of the Case-I realization producer (`lem:case-I-realization`, Phase 22,
option (a)): a `0`-dof (body-hinge-rigid) graph `H` — `def(H̃) = 0` — has a base `B` of `M(H̃)`
that decomposes into `D = bodyBarDim n` edge-disjoint forests of `H̃ ↾ B`, with the full edge
count `|B| = D(|V(H)| − 1)`.

This is the prerequisite the per-leg rigid-seed construction needs: the single-forest brick
`exists_independent_rigidityRows_of_forest` yields only `(D−1)·|J|` independent rigidity rows from
*one* spanning forest, a factor `(D−1)/D` short of the full `D(|V(H)|−1)` that
`HasFullRankRealization k H` demands; reaching full rank needs the `D`-fold packing assembled here,
not a single tree. The base `B` is a maximal `(D,D)`-independent (hence `(D,D)`-sparse, via
`matroidMG_indep_iff`) edge subset, so `tutte_nash_williams` decomposes it into `D` edge-disjoint
forests; its cardinality is `rank M(H̃) = D(|V(H)|−1)` because `def(H̃) = 0`
(`isBase_ncard_add_deficiency_eq`). Regime `[NeZero (bodyHingeMult n)]` (`D ≥ 1`, also forcing the
copies that `mulTilde` needs); `V(H).Nonempty`.

The `↾ B` restriction is forced: a general rigid `H` may be over-braced (`def(H̃) = 0` with extra
edges), so the *whole* `H̃` need not be sparse — only a base packs into forests. The remaining
Track-A obstruction (`notes/Phase22.md` *Hand-off*, option (a)) is to stack the `D` forests'
rigidity rows to the full `D(|V(H)|−1)` count and produce the rigid seed; this lemma supplies the
forest packing those rows are read off. -/

consequence): a minimal `k`-dof-graph with exactly two vertices and `D ≥ 2` has at
most two edges, i.e. `E(G).ncard ≤ 2`.

Proof: if `|E(G)| ≥ 3`, pick three distinct edges `e₁, e₂, e₃`. The restriction
`H := G ↾ {e₁, e₂}` is `0`-dof by `isKDof_zero_of_parallel_pair`. The corank bridge
gives a base `B_H` of `M(H̃)` with `|B_H| = D`; by `matroidMG_restrict_mulTilde`,
`B_H` is `M(G̃)`-independent of size `D`, giving `rank M(G̃) ≥ D`. Combined with the
rank-deficiency bridge, `k = 0` and `B_H` is a `M(G̃)`-base. But `B_H ⊆ E(H̃)` avoids
`ẽ₃`, contradicting `hG.2`. -/

/-! ## Fresh-edge supply (the `hfresh` repair; `notes/FreshEdgeSupply-design.md`)

The combinatorial induction (Phase 20+) repeatedly needs a fresh edge label — one
not already used by the graph in hand — to splice in as a new edge. The
unconditioned universal supply `∀ G', ∃ e₀, e₀ ∉ E(G')` threaded through the
Theorem-5.5 spine turned out to be **unsatisfiable** (the all-loops-at-one-vertex
graph has `E(G') = univ`); the two lemmas below deliver the repaired,
**minimality-conditioned** supply the design doc's *Verdict* settles on: minimal
`k`-dof-graphs have a bounded edge count (`edgeSet_ncard_add_deficiency_le_of_isMinimalKDof`),
so a large-enough `β` always has an unused label
(`freshEdgeSupply_of_card_lt`). -/

/-- **Minimality bounds the edge count** (`notes/FreshEdgeSupply-design.md`
*Satisfiability*, item 1): for a minimal `k`-dof-graph `G`,
`|E(G)| + def(G̃) ≤ D(|V(G)| - 1)`.

Proof: take a base `B` of `M(G̃)`; minimality (`hG.2`) makes every edge-fiber of
`e ∈ E(G)` meet `B`, so `E(G) ⊆ Prod.fst '' B` and `|E(G)| ≤ |Prod.fst '' B| ≤
|B|`. Conclude with the corank bridge `isBase_ncard_add_deficiency_eq`,
`|B| + def(G̃) = D(|V(G)| - 1)`. -/

*Satisfiability*, item 2 — the reshaped `hfresh` Tier-2 binder's derivation
lemma): if `D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 1` and `β` has more elements than the maximal
edge count a minimal `c`-dof-graph on `α` can reach, `D·(|α|-1) < |β|`, then
every minimal `c`-dof-graph (any `c`, any `G'`) has an edge label not in
`E(G')`.

Proof: if `E(G') = univ` then, since `hcard`'s right side is positive, `β` is
nonempty; picking any label gives an edge of `G'`, hence a vertex, hence
`V(G')` and (locally) `α` are nonempty. The edge-count bound above plus
`deficiency_nonneg` then force `|β| = |E(G')| ≤ D(|V(G')|-1) ≤ D(|α|-1) <
|β|`, a contradiction. -/
