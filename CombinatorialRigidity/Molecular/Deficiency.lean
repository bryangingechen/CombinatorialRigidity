# The matroid `M(G̃)`, deficiency, and `k`-dof graphs (`sec:molecular-deficiency`)

Phase 19, the third phase of the molecular-conjecture program (Phases 17–26; see
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). Where `Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean` (Phase 18)
built the *analytic* side — the panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)`, its rank,
and the three rank lemmas — this file builds the *matroidal* side: the matroid
`M(G̃)`, the `D`-deficiency, the `k`-degree-of-freedom hierarchy, rigid subgraphs,
and the bridge `def(G̃) = corank M(G̃)` of Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
(*A proof of the molecular conjecture*, Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, §2.5, §3).

This file lands the `sec:molecular-deficiency` dep-graph in dependency order. The
leaf node landing here:

* `matroidMG` (`def:matroid-MG`) — the matroid `M(G̃)`, where `G̃ = (D-1)·G` is the
  multiplied graph of Phase 16 (`Graph.edgeMultiply`, with `D = bodyBarDim n` so
  `D - 1 = bodyHingeMult n`). `M(G̃)` is the `(D,D)`-count matroid of `G̃` at the
  **boundary regime** `ℓ = 2k = D`: the `D`-fold union of the cycle (graphic)
  matroid of `G̃`, restricted to `E(G̃)`. This is *not* covered by the
  matroidal-regime construction of `CountMatroid.lean` (built for `ℓ < 2k`);
  `M(G̃)` is instead the `D`-fold graphic-matroid union of Phases 13/14, whose
  independence characterization is Tutte–Nash-Williams tree-packing.
* `matroidMG_indep_iff` (`def:matroid-MG`, the boundary-regime cleanliness check) —
  confirms the boundary regime is clean before the rest of the chapter relies on
  it: a bar set `E'` is independent in `M(G̃)` iff `E' ⊆ E(G̃)` and the
  edge-restricted subgraph `G̃ ↾ E'` is `(D,D)`-sparse, equivalently (by
  Tutte–Nash-Williams, `tutte_nash_williams`) decomposes into `D` edge-disjoint
  forests. The forward route is `unionPow_cycleMatroid_indep_iff_isSparse_restrict`
  (Phase 13) under matroid restriction `Matroid.restrict_indep_iff`.
* `partitionDef` / `deficiency` (`def:D-deficiency`) — the `D`-deficiency of a partition
  `P` of `V(G)`, `def(P) = D(|P| - 1) - (D-1)·d_G(P)`, and `def = max_P def(P)`. Partitions
  are encoded as labelings `f : α → α` (the fibers are the parts); `numParts` counts the
  parts `|P| = |f '' V(G)|` and `crossingEdges` collects the edges `d_G(P)` joining distinct
  parts. The deficiency is `ℤ`-valued (genuinely signed) and `≥ 0` by the trivial one-part
  partition (`partitionDef_one`).

* `IsKDof` / `IsMinimalKDof` / `edgeFiber` (`def:k-dof`) — `G` is a `k`-dof-graph
  when `def(G̃) = k`; minimal when additionally every base of `M(G̃)` meets every
  edge-fiber `ẽ` (the `D-1` parallel copies of `e ∈ E(G)`).
* `IsRigidSubgraph` / `IsProperRigidSubgraph` (`def:rigid-subgraph`) — a subgraph
  `H ≤ G` is *rigid* when it is `0`-dof, *proper rigid* when additionally
  `∅ ≠ V(H) ⊊ V(G)`. A *circuit* of `M(G̃)` is `Matroid.IsCircuit (G.matroidMG n)`.
* `matroidMG_restrict_mulTilde` (`lem:matroid-restrict-subgraph`) — the engine of
  KT Lemma 3.3: `M(G̃) ↾ E(H̃) = M(H̃)` for `H ≤ G`, via `Matroid.ext_indep` through
  `matroidMG_indep_iff` (so it never touches the `Matroid.Union` internals).
* `subgraph_minimality` (`lem:subgraph-minimality`, KT Lemma 3.3) — a subgraph
  `H ≤ G` of a minimal `k`-dof-graph `G`, with `def(H̃) = k'`, is a minimal
  `k'`-dof-graph. The base/fiber-meeting minimality transports from `G` to `H` over
  the restriction identity: a base `B'` of `M(H̃) = M(G̃) ↾ E(H̃)` extends to a base
  `B` of `M(G̃)` with `B' = B ∩ E(H̃)`, and each fiber `ẽ` of `e ∈ E(H) ⊆ E(G)` lies
  in `E(H̃)`, so `B ∩ ẽ ≠ ∅` (from `G`'s minimality) descends to `B' ∩ ẽ ≠ ∅`.

* `two_le_crossingEdges_of_isKDof_zero` (`lem:two-edge-conn`, KT Lemma 3.1) — a
  body-hinge-rigid (`0`-dof) graph is `2`-edge-connected, in cut form: any nonempty
  proper `V' ⊊ V(G)` separating `V(G)` has `d_G(V') ≥ 2`. (Mathlib has no
  edge-connectivity predicate for `Graph α β`, so the conclusion is the cut form KT's
  proof uses.) The bridge cut `{V', V∖V'}` (a two-part partition, `cutLabeling` /
  `numParts_cutLabeling`) would otherwise witness `def ≥ D - (D-1)·d_G(V') ≥ 1 > 0`
  through `partitionDef_le_deficiency`, contradicting `def = 0`.

* `rank_matroidMG_le` (`lem:rank-matroidMG-le`, the conjecture-relevant half of
  `thm:def-eq-corank`) — the rank upper bound `rank M(G̃) ≤ D·(|V(G)| - 1)` for
  `V(G).Nonempty`. Every base is `(D,D)`-sparse (boundary-regime cleanliness), so
  applying sparsity to the base itself gives `|B| + D ≤ D·|spanningVerts B| ≤ D·|V|`,
  i.e. `|B| ≤ D(|V|-1)`. This is the matroidal mirror of Phase 18's analytic
  `rank R(G,p) ≤ D(|V|-1)`; it is the upper-bound half the molecular conjecture
  (Thm 5.6) needs from the def = corank bridge — the reverse direction of the full
  Jackson–Jordán min–max identity (the partition attaining the rank) is deferred until
  a downstream node needs the full equality (risk #4, prove-vs-hypothesize).

* `isSparse_diff_singleton_of_isCircuit` (`lem:circuit-rigid`, KT Lemma 3.4 matroidal
  core) — for a circuit `X` of `M(G̃)` and `e ∈ X`, the set `X \ {e}` is `(D,D)`-sparse,
  equivalently an `M(G̃)`-basis of `X`: a circuit is exactly one edge short of being
  independent on its span. This is the upper-bound / maximal-sparse-subset form that KT's
  fundamental-circuit arguments (Phases 21–22) consume; the full `G[V(X)]`-is-rigid
  (`def = 0`, tightness *equality*) conclusion needs the deferred reverse half of
  `thm:def-eq-corank` (risk #4) and lands with it.

See `ROADMAP.md` §19 / `notes/Phase19.md` and the `sec:molecular-deficiency`
dep-graph of `blueprint/src/chapter/deficiency.tex`. The remaining node (the full bridge
`thm:def-eq-corank`) lands in a subsequent commit.

(`def:matroid-MG`), where `D = bodyBarDim n`. Each hinge (edge) of `G` is replaced
by the `D - 1 = bodyHingeMult n` parallel copies that the body-hinge reduction of
Phase 16 attaches to it (`Graph.edgeMultiply`); the edge type becomes
`β × Fin (bodyHingeMult n)`. This is the graph the matroid `M(G̃)` lives over. -/

/-- The **matroid `M(G̃)`** (`def:matroid-MG`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §2.5): the
`(D,D)`-count matroid of the multiplied graph `G̃ = (D-1)·G` at the boundary regime
`ℓ = 2k = D` with `D = bodyBarDim n`. Concretely it is the `D`-fold union of the
cycle (graphic) matroid of `G̃`, restricted to the edge set `E(G̃)`.

This is the matroidal substrate of the molecular-conjecture program. The boundary
regime `ℓ = 2k = D` is *not* the matroidal regime `ℓ < 2k` of `CountMatroid.lean`;
`M(G̃)` is built instead from the `D`-fold graphic-matroid union of Phases 13/14
(`Matroid.Union (fun _ : Fin D ↦ (G̃).cycleMatroid)`), whose independence
characterization is Tutte–Nash-Williams tree-packing. The restriction `↾ E(G̃)` is
forced exactly as in Phase 14's `kFrameMatroid`: the vendored `Matroid.Union` has
ground set `univ : Set (β × Fin (bodyHingeMult n))`, so without the restriction
every non-edge would be a loop. -/

/-- **Boundary-regime cleanliness** of `M(G̃)` (`def:matroid-MG`): a bar set `E'` is
independent in `M(G̃)` if and only if `E' ⊆ E(G̃)` and the edge-restricted subgraph
`G̃ ↾ E'` is `(D,D)`-sparse, with `D = bodyBarDim n` and `G̃ = (D-1)·G`. This
confirms — as the first formalization step of Phase 19 — that the boundary regime
`ℓ = 2k = D` is clean before the rest of the chapter relies on it: the independent
sets of `M(G̃)` are exactly the `(D,D)`-sparse subsets of `G̃`.

By Tutte–Nash-Williams (`tutte_nash_williams`, applied to `G̃ ↾ E'`) these are
equivalently the bar subsets that decompose into `D` edge-disjoint forests. The
proof unfolds the restriction (`Matroid.restrict_indep_iff`) and feeds the
`D`-fold cycle-matroid union to Phase 13's
`unionPow_cycleMatroid_indep_iff_isSparse_restrict`. -/

with its `(D,D)`-sparsity inside `H̃ ↾ S` whenever `H ≤ G` and `S` lies within `E(H̃)`:
restriction to a fiber subset of the smaller graph cannot see the difference between
`H` and `G`. The edge sets coincide (`E(G̃ ↾ S) = S = E(H̃ ↾ S)`) and the spanned-vertex
counts coincide because the incidences of an edge `e ∈ E' ⊆ E(H̃)` agree under the
subgraph relation. This is the `IsSparse`-level engine of the matroid-restriction

construction. Proved by `Matroid.ext_indep`, routing both sides through the

matroid iff it is `(D,D)`-sparse, and those sparsities agree by

/-! ## `D`-deficiency (`def:D-deficiency`)

A *partition* `P` of `V(G)` is encoded by a labeling `f : α → α` (the kernel of `f`,
i.e. its fibers, give the parts; vertices outside `V(G)` are irrelevant). The
*number of parts* `|P|` is the number of distinct `f`-labels carried by the
vertices of `G`, `|f '' V(G)|`, and the *crossing-edge count* `d_G(P)` is the
number of edges of `G` whose two endpoints receive different labels. KT's
`def_{\tilde G}(P) = D(|P| - 1) - (D-1)·d_G(P)` (`D = bodyBarDim n`) is genuinely
signed — a fine partition crossing many edges has *negative* deficiency — so it is
`ℤ`-valued; the deficiency `def(\tilde G) = max_P def_{\tilde G}(P)` takes the
maximum and is `≥ 0` (witnessed by the trivial one-part partition, `partitionDef_one`). -/

/-- The number of edges of `G` **crossing** the partition `P` (encoded by a labeling
`f : α → α`): edges `e ∈ E(G)` with endpoints `x, y` such that `f x ≠ f y`. This is
`d_G(P)` in Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §2.5. Counted with `Set.ncard` to match the project's
edge-counting idiom. -/

  {e ∈ E(G) | ∃ x y, G.IsLink e x y ∧ f x ≠ f y}

/-- The number of **parts** `|P|` of the partition of `V(G)` encoded by a labeling

`D = bodyBarDim n`, `|P| = numParts G f` the number of parts, and `d_G(P) =
|crossingEdges G f|` the number of edges crossing `P`. `ℤ`-valued because the

partitions `P` of `V(G)`. Partitions are quantified as labelings `f : α → α`; over the
`ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrder` `ℤ` the supremum is taken with `iSup`, and under
`[Finite α]` it is a finite supremum, hence attained, bounded, and `≥ 0` (the trivial
one-part partition, `partitionDef_one`, witnesses `0`). It measures how far `\tilde G`
is from being independently realizable as a rigid body-hinge framework. -/

A multigraph `G` is a *`k`-dof-graph* (`k` degrees of freedom) when
`def(G̃) = k`; the `0`-dof case is exactly the body-hinge-rigid case
(`thm:body-hinge-tay`). `G` is a *minimal `k`-dof-graph* when, additionally, no
edge can be deleted without changing the deficiency — encoded matroidally as:
every base `B` of `M(G̃)` meets every *edge-fiber* `ẽ` (the `D-1` parallel
copies `{p | p.1 = e}` of an edge `e ∈ E(G)`). Minimal `k`-dof-graphs are the
objects the combinatorial induction of Phase 20 (Theorem 4.9) reduces to the
two-vertex double edge. -/

/-- The **edge-fiber** `ẽ` of an edge `e ∈ E(G)` in the multiplied graph
`G̃ = (D-1)·G` (`def:k-dof`): the `D - 1 = bodyHingeMult n` parallel copies of `e`,
i.e. the set `{p : β × Fin (bodyHingeMult n) | p.1 = e}`. A base of `M(G̃)` meets
`ẽ` exactly when it retains at least one of the `D-1` copies of `e`. -/

of an edge `e ∈ E(G)` — no edge of `G` can be deleted without lowering the rank
of `M(G̃)`, hence changing the deficiency. The base/fiber-meeting condition is
phrased over `Matroid.IsBase` and `Graph.edgeFiber`. These are the objects the
combinatorial induction of Phase 20 (Theorem 4.9) reduces to the two-vertex

/-! ## Rigid subgraphs and circuits (`def:rigid-subgraph`)

A subgraph `H ⊆ G` (`H ≤ G`, the multigraph `Graph.IsSubgraph` order) is *rigid*
when it is `0`-dof — `def(H̃) = 0` — equivalently (`thm:body-hinge-tay`) `H̃` packs
`D` edge-disjoint spanning trees. It is a *proper* rigid subgraph when its vertex
set is a nonempty proper subset `∅ ≠ V(H) ⊊ V(G)`. A *circuit* of `M(G̃)` is a
minimal dependent edge set; this is mathlib's `Matroid.IsCircuit (G.matroidMG n)`.
These are the structural objects the algebraic induction of Phases 21–23 reduces
against (rigid subgraphs feed Case I, circuits feed `lem:circuit-rigid`). -/

/-- `H` is a **rigid subgraph** of `G` (`def:rigid-subgraph`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §3):
`H ≤ G` (a subgraph in the multigraph `Graph.IsSubgraph` order) and `H` is `0`-dof,
i.e. `def(H̃) = 0` with `H̃ = (D-1)·H` and `D = bodyBarDim n`. By
`thm:body-hinge-tay` this is exactly the body-hinge-rigid case: `H̃` packs `D`

/-! ## Subgraph minimality (`lem:subgraph-minimality`; KT Lemma 3.3) -/

/-- **Subgraph minimality** (`lem:subgraph-minimality`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 3.3):
a subgraph `H ≤ G` of a minimal `k`-dof-graph `G` is itself a minimal `k'`-dof-graph,
where `k' = def(H̃)` is whatever deficiency `H` happens to have. (In particular a
*rigid* subgraph — `k' = 0` — of a minimal `k`-dof-graph is a minimal `0`-dof-graph,
the form used in Cases I/III of the algebraic induction.)

The deficiency half (`H.IsKDof n k'`) is supplied as a hypothesis (it is the definition
of `k'`); the content is the base/fiber-meeting minimality transport. The engine is the
matroid identity `M(G̃) ↾ E(H̃) = M(H̃)` (`matroidMG_restrict_mulTilde`): a base `B'` of
`M(H̃)` is an `M(G̃)`-basis of `E(H̃)` (`isBase_restrict_iff'`), so it extends to a base
`B ⊇ B'` of `M(G̃)` (`Indep.exists_isBase_superset`) with `B' = B ∩ E(H̃)` by maximality
(`IsBasis'.eq_of_subset_indep`). Each edge-fiber `ẽ` of an `e ∈ E(H) ⊆ E(G)` lies inside
`E(H̃)`, so `G`'s minimality (`B ∩ ẽ ≠ ∅`) transports to `B' ∩ ẽ = (B ∩ E(H̃)) ∩ ẽ =
B ∩ ẽ ≠ ∅`. -/

/-! ## A circuit yields a rigid subgraph (`lem:circuit-rigid`; KT Lemma 3.4) -/

/-- **A circuit minus an edge is a maximal sparse subset** (`lem:circuit-rigid`;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 Lemma 3.4, matroidal core). Let `X` be a circuit of `M(G̃)` and
`e ∈ X`. Then `X \ {e}` is `(D,D)`-sparse — equivalently, an `M(G̃)`-basis of `X`
(`X \ {e}` is a maximal independent subset of `X`, and `X` itself is dependent). This
is the structural content KT's fundamental-circuit arguments consume (Lemmas 4.5,
6.10–6.11 of the algebraic induction, Phases 21–22): a circuit is exactly one edge
short of being independent on its vertex span.

KT's full Lemma 3.4 concludes that the vertex-induced subgraph `G[V(X)]` is *rigid*
(`0`-dof) — more precisely that `X − e` partitions into `D` edge-disjoint spanning
trees on `V(X)`, i.e. `|X − e| = D(|V(X)| − 1)` exactly. That tightness *equality*
(and the `def(G[V(X)]̃) = 0` reading of it) needs the **lower** bound `|X| >
D(|V(X)| − 1)` forced by `X` being dependent, which in this count matroid is the
reverse direction of the full `def = corank` min–max (`thm:def-eq-corank`, the JJ09
generic-rank identity, risk #4) — deferred with that node. The `(D,D)`-sparse /
basis form here is the upper-bound half, self-contained on the boundary-regime
cleanliness `matroidMG_indep_iff`. -/

/-! ## Two-edge-connectivity (`lem:two-edge-conn`; KT Lemma 3.1)

A body-hinge-rigid (`0`-dof) graph `G` is `2`-edge-connected. Mathlib carries no
edge-connectivity predicate for the multigraph `Graph α β` (only for `SimpleGraph`),
so — as flagged in `notes/Phase19.md` — the lemma is phrased directly in the cut form
Katoh–Tanigawa's proof actually uses: for the cut `{V', V∖V'}` induced by a nonempty
proper vertex set `V' ⊊ V(G)`, the number of edges crossing the cut is `≥ 2`. A
crossing count of `≤ 1` would let the trivial bridge cut `{V', V∖V'}` witness
`def(G̃) ≥ D·(2-1) - (D-1)·d_G(P) ≥ D - (D-1) = 1`, contradicting `def(G̃) = 0`. -/

/-- The **cut labeling** of a vertex set `V'`: the labeling `f : α → α` collapsing `V'`
to a representative `a` and its complement to `b`. Its fibers on `V(G)` are `V'` and
`V(G) ∖ V'`, so it encodes the partition `P = {V', V∖V'}` whose crossing edges are
`d_G(V')`. Used by `lem:two-edge-conn` to feed a bridge cut to `partitionDef`. -/

/-- The cut labeling of a vertex set `V'` separating `V(G)` (both `a ∈ V' ⊆ V(G)` and a
distinct `b ∈ V(G) ∖ V'`) has exactly two parts: `numParts G (cutLabeling V' a b) = 2`.
The image of `V(G)` is `{a, b}` (every vertex maps to one or the other; both are hit by
`a` itself and `b` itself), and `a ≠ b` because `b ∉ V'`. -/

/-- **Two-edge-connectivity in cut form** (`lem:two-edge-conn`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
Lemma 3.1): a body-hinge-rigid (`0`-dof) graph `G` admits no bridge cut. For a nonempty
proper vertex set `V' ⊊ V(G)` that separates `V(G)` (witnessed by `a ∈ V' ⊆ V(G)` and a
distinct `b ∈ V(G) ∖ V'`), at least two edges cross the cut `{V', V∖V'}`:
`2 ≤ d_G(V') = |crossingEdges G (cutLabeling V' a b)|`.

Proof (KT Lemma 3.1): the cut `{V', V∖V'}` is a two-part partition
(`numParts_cutLabeling`), so `def_{G̃}(P) = D·(2-1) - (D-1)·d_G(P) = D - (D-1)·d_G(P)`.
If `d_G(P) ≤ 1` then `def_{G̃}(P) ≥ D - (D-1) = 1 > 0 = def(G̃)`, contradicting that the
deficiency (an upper bound for every partition, `partitionDef_le_deficiency`) is `0`.
With `D = bodyBarDim n ≥ 1` this forces `d_G(P) ≥ 2`. -/
