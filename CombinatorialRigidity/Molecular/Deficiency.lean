# The matroid `M(G̃)`, deficiency, and `k`-dof graphs (`sec:molecular-deficiency`)

Phase 19, the third phase of the molecular-conjecture program (Phases 17–26; see
`notes/MolecularConjecture.md`). Where `Molecular/RigidityMatrix.lean` (Phase 18)
built the *analytic* side — the panel-hinge rigidity matrix `R(G,p)`, its rank,
and the three rank lemmas — this file builds the *matroidal* side: the matroid
`M(G̃)`, the `D`-deficiency, the `k`-degree-of-freedom hierarchy, rigid subgraphs,
and the bridge `def(G̃) = corank M(G̃)` of Katoh–Tanigawa 2011
(*A proof of the molecular conjecture*, Discrete Comput. Geom. **45**, §2.5, §3).

This file lands the `sec:molecular-deficiency` dep-graph in dependency order. The
leaf node landing here:

* `matroidMG` (`def:matroid-MG`) — the matroid `M(G̃)`, where `G̃ = (D-1)·G` is the
  multiplied graph of Phase 16 (`Graph.edgeMultiply`, with `D = bodyBarDim n` so
  `D - 1 = bodyHingeMult n`). `M(G̃)` is the `(D,D)`-count matroid of `G̃` at the
  **boundary regime** `ℓ = 2k = D`: the `D`-fold union of the cycle (graphic)
  matroid of `G̃`, restricted to `E(G̃)`. This is *not* covered by the
  matroidal-regime construction of `CountMatroid.lean` (built for `ℓ < 2k`);
  `M(G̃)` is instead the `D`-fold graphic-matroid union of Phases 13/14, whose
  independence characterization is Tutte–Nash-Williams tree-packing.
* `matroidMG_indep_iff` (`def:matroid-MG`, the boundary-regime cleanliness check) —
  confirms the boundary regime is clean before the rest of the chapter relies on
  it: a bar set `E'` is independent in `M(G̃)` iff `E' ⊆ E(G̃)` and the
  edge-restricted subgraph `G̃ ↾ E'` is `(D,D)`-sparse, equivalently (by
  Tutte–Nash-Williams, `tutte_nash_williams`) decomposes into `D` edge-disjoint
  forests. The forward route is `unionPow_cycleMatroid_indep_iff_isSparse_restrict`
  (Phase 13) under matroid restriction `Matroid.restrict_indep_iff`.
* `partitionDef` / `deficiency` (`def:D-deficiency`) — the `D`-deficiency of a partition
  `P` of `V(G)`, `def(P) = D(|P| - 1) - (D-1)·d_G(P)`, and `def = max_P def(P)`. Partitions
  are encoded as labelings `f : α → α` (the fibers are the parts); `numParts` counts the
  parts `|P| = |f '' V(G)|` and `crossingEdges` collects the edges `d_G(P)` joining distinct
  parts. The deficiency is `ℤ`-valued (genuinely signed) and `≥ 0` by the trivial one-part
  partition (`partitionDef_one`).

See `ROADMAP.md` §19 / `notes/Phase19.md` and the `sec:molecular-deficiency`
dep-graph of `blueprint/src/chapter/deficiency.tex`. The remaining nodes
(`def:k-dof`, `def:rigid-subgraph`, the structural lemmas KT 3.1/3.3/3.4, and the
bridge `thm:def-eq-corank`) land in subsequent commits.

/-- The **multiplied graph** `G̃ = (D-1)·G` of the molecular conjecture
(`def:matroid-MG`), where `D = bodyBarDim n`. Each hinge (edge) of `G` is replaced
by the `D - 1 = bodyHingeMult n` parallel copies that the body-hinge reduction of
Phase 16 attaches to it (`Graph.edgeMultiply`); the edge type becomes
`β × Fin (bodyHingeMult n)`. This is the graph the matroid `M(G̃)` lives over. -/

/-- The **matroid `M(G̃)`** (`def:matroid-MG`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §2.5): the
`(D,D)`-count matroid of the multiplied graph `G̃ = (D-1)·G` at the boundary regime
`ℓ = 2k = D` with `D = bodyBarDim n`. Concretely it is the `D`-fold union of the
cycle (graphic) matroid of `G̃`, restricted to the edge set `E(G̃)`.

This is the matroidal substrate of the molecular-conjecture program. The boundary
regime `ℓ = 2k = D` is *not* the matroidal regime `ℓ < 2k` of `CountMatroid.lean`;
`M(G̃)` is built instead from the `D`-fold graphic-matroid union of Phases 13/14
(`Matroid.Union (fun _ : Fin D ↦ (G̃).cycleMatroid)`), whose independence
characterization is Tutte–Nash-Williams tree-packing. The restriction `↾ E(G̃)` is
forced exactly as in Phase 14's `kFrameMatroid`: the vendored `Matroid.Union` has
ground set `univ : Set (β × Fin (bodyHingeMult n))`, so without the restriction
every non-edge would be a loop. -/

/-- **Boundary-regime cleanliness** of `M(G̃)` (`def:matroid-MG`): a bar set `E'` is
independent in `M(G̃)` if and only if `E' ⊆ E(G̃)` and the edge-restricted subgraph
`G̃ ↾ E'` is `(D,D)`-sparse, with `D = bodyBarDim n` and `G̃ = (D-1)·G`. This
confirms — as the first formalization step of Phase 19 — that the boundary regime
`ℓ = 2k = D` is clean before the rest of the chapter relies on it: the independent
sets of `M(G̃)` are exactly the `(D,D)`-sparse subsets of `G̃`.

By Tutte–Nash-Williams (`tutte_nash_williams`, applied to `G̃ ↾ E'`) these are
equivalently the bar subsets that decompose into `D` edge-disjoint forests. The
proof unfolds the restriction (`Matroid.restrict_indep_iff`) and feeds the
`D`-fold cycle-matroid union to Phase 13's
`unionPow_cycleMatroid_indep_iff_isSparse_restrict`. -/

/-! ## `D`-deficiency (`def:D-deficiency`)

A *partition* `P` of `V(G)` is encoded by a labeling `f : α → α` (the kernel of `f`,
i.e. its fibers, give the parts; vertices outside `V(G)` are irrelevant). The
*number of parts* `|P|` is the number of distinct `f`-labels carried by the
vertices of `G`, `|f '' V(G)|`, and the *crossing-edge count* `d_G(P)` is the
number of edges of `G` whose two endpoints receive different labels. KT's
`def_{\tilde G}(P) = D(|P| - 1) - (D-1)·d_G(P)` (`D = bodyBarDim n`) is genuinely
signed — a fine partition crossing many edges has *negative* deficiency — so it is
`ℤ`-valued; the deficiency `def(\tilde G) = max_P def_{\tilde G}(P)` takes the
maximum and is `≥ 0` (witnessed by the trivial one-part partition, `partitionDef_one`). -/

/-- The number of edges of `G` **crossing** the partition `P` (encoded by a labeling
`f : α → α`): edges `e ∈ E(G)` with endpoints `x, y` such that `f x ≠ f y`. This is
`d_G(P)` in Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §2.5. Counted with `Set.ncard` to match the project's
edge-counting idiom. -/
def crossingEdges (G : Graph α β) (f : α → α) : Set β :=
  {e ∈ E(G) | ∃ x y, G.IsLink e x y ∧ f x ≠ f y}

/-- The number of **parts** `|P|` of the partition of `V(G)` encoded by a labeling
`f : α → α`: the number of distinct labels carried by the vertices of `G`,
`|f '' V(G)|`. -/

/-- The **`D`-deficiency** of a partition `P` of `V(G)` (`def:D-deficiency`;
Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §2.5): `def_{\tilde G}(P) = D(|P| - 1) - (D-1)·d_G(P)`, with
`D = bodyBarDim n`, `|P| = numParts G f` the number of parts, and `d_G(P) =
|crossingEdges G f|` the number of edges crossing `P`. `ℤ`-valued because the
quantity is genuinely signed (a fine partition crossing many edges is negative). -/

/-- The **`D`-deficiency** of `\tilde G` (`def:D-deficiency`; Katoh–Tanigawa 2011 §2.5):
`def(\tilde G) = max_P def_{\tilde G}(P)`, the maximum of `partitionDef` over all
partitions `P` of `V(G)`. Partitions are quantified as labelings `f : α → α`; over the
`ConditionallyCompleteLinearOrder` `ℤ` the supremum is taken with `iSup`, and under
`[Finite α]` it is a finite supremum, hence attained, bounded, and `≥ 0` (the trivial
one-part partition, `partitionDef_one`, witnesses `0`). It measures how far `\tilde G`
is from being independently realizable as a rigid body-hinge framework. -/
